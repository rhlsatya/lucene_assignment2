Navel and Valencia Oranges Grown in Arizona and Designated Parts of California; Change in Reporting Requirements



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule changing reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona navel and Valencia orange
marketing orders. The marketing orders regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated
parts of California and are administered locally by the Navel and Valencia Orange Administrative Committees (committees).
This rule modifies language in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 38 (Weekly Report of
By-Product Oranges) and specify that Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment) only be utilized
for reporting rail car shipments. These actions reduce the burden of information collection requirements under
the marketing orders.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 (7 CFR parts 907 and 908), as amended, regulating the
handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California, hereinafter referred
to as the ``orders.'' These orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation
under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia
oranges in the regulated areas. In addition, there are about 35 by-product manufacturers that will be affected by
this rule. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers and by-product manufacturers, have been defined
by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and
small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers,
producers, and processors of California-Arizona navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities.

This action finalizes changes in the reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing
orders. This rule modifies language in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 38 (Weekly
Report of By-Product Oranges) and specify that Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment) only
be utilized for reporting rail car shipments. These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. 
The interim final rule was issued on October 8, 1993, and published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 53112, October 14, 1993), with an effective date of October 14, 1993. That rule amended   907.131,
907.141, 908.131, and 908.141 of the rules and regulations in effect under the orders. That rule provided a 30-day
comment period which ended November 15, 1993. No comments were received. 
Sections 907.67 and 908.67 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders provide authority for the exemption
from order regulation the handling of oranges to commercial processors for processing into products, including
juice. Sections 907.131 and 908.131 of the orders' rules and regulations prescribe procedures governing the exemption
from order regulation of such by-product oranges. Included in these procedures are certain reporting requirements
imposed on handlers and by-product manufacturers to help ensure that order requirements and regulations governing
the exemption for by-product oranges are being followed. 
For example, persons who wish to acquire oranges as an approved by-products manufacturer for commercial processing
into by-products exempt from regulation must submit an application to the committee on Form 14 (Application to be
Placed on Approved List of Orange By-Product Manufacturers). These applications are referred to the committees'
compliance department for investigation and then, if appropriate, referred to the committees for approval to be
placed on an approved list of by-product manufacturers. Commercial processors are also required to submit to the
committees copies of Form 15 (Orange Diversion Report) which specify how the oranges were disposed. Finally, approved
by-product manufacturers were required to submit Form 38 (Weekly Report of By-Product Oranges) during the crop year
when processing is occurring. 
The committees have recommended that submission of Form 38 no longer be required under the marketing orders. Submission
of Form 38 was added to the orders' rules and regulations in 1990 because the committees believed that the additional
information would help to ensure that oranges exempted under the by-products exemption did not enter the fresh fruit
market. It was believed that comparisons of the total amount of oranges received by processors with the total amount
of by-products manufactured would give the committees a method to verify that all oranges received were manufactured
into by-products. 
However, the committees have found that the information collected on Form 38 is not necessary to ensure compliance
with order requirements. In addition, much of the information on Form 38 is collected on other reports required to
be submitted under the orders. The committees believe that submission of Form 38 creates an additional burden on by-product
manufacturers that is not necessary. Thus, the committees recommended revising the orders' rules and regulations
to discontinue the use of Form 38. The Department has also made some minor modifications to  907.131 and 908.131
for the purpose of clarity. 
The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
Sections 907.71 and 908.71 of the orange marketing orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information
regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate
whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. 
Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit, on Form 3, a manifest
report of oranges shipped within a 24 hour period. Prior to the effective date of the interim final rule, handlers were
required to include both truck and rail car shipments on Form 3. However, identical information regarding truck shipments
is submitted by handlers on Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment). According to the committees, this duplication
of information created an added burden for handlers and was not necessary. Thus, the committees recommended modifying
the orders' rules and regulations to require that handlers only report rail car shipments on Form 3. Handlers are still
required to submit rail manifests and other appropriate documentation to the committees to substantiate rail car
shipments.

The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers
0581-0116 for navel oranges and 0581-0121 for Valencia oranges. 
This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 25 processors of navel and Valencia oranges who had been completing
Form 38, taking about 0.33 hour to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on approximately
210 handlers who ship primarily by truck, taking about 0.40 hour to complete each report. About 80 handlers who ship
by rail at some point during a season will continue to use Form 3, taking approximately 0.20 hour to complete the report.

Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 53112, October 14, 1993) will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Amendments to the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System for Canadian Issuers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final amendments to Form F-9. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has adopted amendments to Form F-9 under the multijurisdictional
disclosure system (``MJDS'') for Canadian issuers which will recognize investment grade ratings by securities
rating organizations recognized by Canadian securities regulators for purposes of filings on Forms F-9 and
40-F. These amendments have been adopted in light of the Commission's experience with the MJDS and should further
facilitate transnational capital formation. They are being made effective in light of the adoption by Canadian securities
regulators of parallel amendments to the MJDS in Canada for U.S. issuers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Amendments to Form F-9 



On November 3, 1993, the Commission adopted several amendments to the MJDS.
 In the November 3 Release, the Commission stated that the amendments to Form F-9
 relating to recognition of investment grade ratings by securities rating organizations recognized by Canadian
securities regulators would not become effective until such time as the Canadian securities regulators had adopted
parallel amendments to the multijurisdictional disclosure system in Canada for U.S. issuers. 






The Canadian securities regulators have now adopted such amendments with an effective date of December 31, 1993.
As a result, the Commission is publishing this release to make effective the amendments to Form F-9 described
above. 



II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



Pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 605], at the time the Commission issued its
release proposing the amendments being adopted hereby, the Chairman of the Commission certified that such amendments
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. That certification, including the reasons
therefor, was attached as an Appendix to such release and was published in the 

Federal Register

. 



III. Cost-Benefit Analysis 



No specific data were provided in response to the Commission's request regarding the costs and benefits of the amendments
being adopted today. Some commenters indicated that these amendments would save Canadian issuers the expense of
obtaining a securities rating from those rating organizations currently specified under Form F-9. 



IV. Effective Date 



The amendments to Form F-9 shall be effective on the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows effectiveness in less than 30 days after publication
for ``a substantive rule which grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.'' 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).




V. Statutory Bases 



The amendments to the Commission's rule and form are being proposed pursuant to sections 6, 7, 8, 10 and 19(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 3(b), 4A, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

I. Introduction 



On December 4, 1992, the Commission issued Order No. 497-D

1

 in response to the opinion issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 

Tenneco Gas 

v. 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Tenneco)



2

 which upheld in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497-A,

3

 the Commission's final rule governing the relationship between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing
or brokering affiliates. However, the court found that the Commission did not adequately justify its extension of
the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of  161.3(f)

4

 of the Commission's regulations to gas sales and marketing information. Further, in its review of Ozark Gas Transmission
System (Ozark),

5

 a consolidated case, the court found that, based upon the evidence in the record, the Commission erred in finding Order
No. 497 applicable to Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark), a joint venture. Accordingly, the court remanded the
proceeding to the Commission. In response to the court's remand, the Commission issued Order No. 497-D which
revised  161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales
and marketing information, and found that Ozark is subject to the requirements of Order No. 497. In addition, Order
No. 497-D extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992, until December
31, 1993. However, the order stated that 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline is
in full compliance with Order No. 636,

6

 the pipeline would not be required to submit the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) to the Commission.
The order stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and provide its affiliated transportation log information
on its electronic bulletin board (EBB). 










This order (1) deletes the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing information from the contemporaneous
disclosure requirement, (2) affirms the Commission's decision to eliminate the filing of Form 592, (3) affirms the
Commission's decision that Ozark is subject to Order No. 497, (4) rejects Hadson Gas Systems, Inc.'s (Hadson) argument
that the Commission's procedures for acting on   161.3(j) and 284.286(e) filings prohibit public participation,
(5) requires all future standards of conduct filings made under section 161.3(j) and all requests for waiver of the
standards to include form notices, suitable for publishing in the 

Federal Register

, (6) clarifies what type of employee is an ``operating employee'' for purposes of the Order No. 497 regulations, and
(7) extends the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements until June 30, 1994, because concurrently with
this order the Commission is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) in Docket No. RM94-6-000 which
proposes to revise Order No. 497's reporting requirements.

II. Public Reporting Burden 



The public reporting burden under FERC-592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, as revised by Order
Nos. 497-D and 636, is expected to remain unchanged. Currently, the reporting burden is estimated to average
9.94 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Annual reporting requirements
under FERC-592 are expected to total 7,882 hours, based on an estimated 793 responses from approximately 61
respondents. 

Issued concurrently with this order is a NOPR in Docket No. RM94-6-000.

7

 The NOPR proposes to significantly reduce the FERC-592 information reporting requirements and burden. Extending
the sunset date for FERC-592 through June 30, 1994, will give interested parties and the Commission time to evaluate
the NOPR comments and allow the Commission time to prepare a final rule. 





Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this information collection,
including suggestions for reductions to the reporting burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202)
208-1415, FAX (202) 208-2425]. Comments on these reporting requirements may also be sent to the Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (202) 395-6880]. 

Hard copy and/or electronic formats for any data collection required by this order may be obtained by contacting:
La Dorn Systems Corporation, room 3308, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. 



III. Background 



On July 21, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its opinion in 

Tenneco,

 upholding in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497-A. However, the court found that the Commission did not
adequately justify its extension of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of  161.3(f) to gas sales
and marketing information. The court stated that ``[o]n remand the Commission should reconsider its justification
for applying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of  161.3(f)] to sales and marketing information
and ensure that the final requirement is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market
and benefitting consumers, as well as preventing undue discrimination.'' 

8

 In a related matter, the court stated that ``[a]pplying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of  161.3(f)]
to released-gas information prior to the issuance of Order No. 497-A might well be fundamentally unfair'' and
that the Commission could avoid ``the expense of litigation over this issue by announcing that it will not retroactively
apply [ 161.3(f)] to released gas information.''

9

 Further, in its review of 

Ozark,

 the court found that the Commission erred in finding Order No. 497 applicable to Ozark, a joint venture partnership
composed of subsidiaries of four natural gas pipelines, each of which has a 25 percent ownership and voting interest.
The court stated that the Commission failed to consider relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner pipelines
with affiliates to control the partnership. 






On December 4, 1992, in response to the court's opinion in 

Tenneco,

 the Commission issued Order No. 497-D, an order on remand and extending sunset date. Based upon the court's opinion,
and in light of the structural changes in the gas industry that were to occur as a result of Order No. 636, the Commission
revised  161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales
and marketing information. Under revised standard (f), pipelines are still required to contemporaneously disclose
information related to transportation of natural gas. However, with respect to information related to gas sales
or marketing, pipelines are only required to disclose information relating to sales or marketing on its system or
the system of an affiliated pipeline. There are two categories of gas sales or marketing information that are not required
to be contemporaneously disclosed: (1) Gas sales or marketing information that is available from public sources
and (2) information related to gas sales off a pipeline's system, but not involving the system of an affiliated pipeline.
Section 161.3(f) now reads:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940104-0-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To the extent [a pipeline] provides to a marketing affiliate information related to transportation of natural gas,
or information related to gas sales or gas marketing on its system or the system of an affiliated pipeline, it must provide
that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers, affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Pipelines
are not required to contemporaneously disclose: (1) Gas sales or gas marketing information that is available from
public sources and (2) Information related to gas sales or gas marketing off a pipeline's system, but not involving
the system of an affiliated pipeline. 




In a related matter, based upon the court's advice, the Commission stated that it will not retroactively apply the
contemporaneous disclosure requirement of standard (f) to released gas information, that is, standard (f)'s application
to released gas information would begin with the issuance of Order No. 497-A. 

With respect to the issue of Order No. 497's applicability to Ozark, the Commission found that despite the fact that
there is a unanimous approval provision in the Ozark partnership agreement, the two partners that have parent companies
with marketing affiliates shipping on Ozark's line can still exercise ``control'' as defined by  161.2 of the
Commission's regulations.

10

 The Commission found that even with a unanimous approval provision in the partnership agreement, Ozark Pipeline
Company and Tennessee Ozark Gas Company, the two partners whose parent companies have marketing affiliates, can
each act alone to direct or effect the management or policies of Ozark Gas Transmission System. The Commission stated
that since there is a unanimous approval requirement, each partner has veto power over any decision by simply withholding
its vote. The Commission stated that such power could be exercised in a manner that could unduly prefer the marketing
affiliates related to Ozark's partners, for example, by either or both partners refusing to engage in an action that
would benefit an independent marketer in competition with one of Ozark's partners' affiliates. The Commission stated
that it believed that control can be exercised in a negative manner, 

i.e.,

 by withholding approval of a specific policy or transaction, as well as in an affirmative manner, 

i.e.,

 by actually approving a decision that would unduly prefer a marketing affiliate. 





Finally, the Commission extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992,
until December 31, 1993, because of the important role they will play in the regulatory structure created by Order
No. 636. The Commission stated that although Order No. 636 does not change the requirements governing the relationship
between pipelines and their marketing affiliates, the structural changes engendered by full compliance with the
rule would remove the need to continue filing the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) with the Commission.
The Commission stated that Order No. 636's Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) requirements ensure certain minimum
standards for maintaining and communicating information about a pipeline's available capacity, current capacity
release offers, and affiliate marketing-related information. The order stated that unless further case-specific
action is taken by the Commission, 90 days after the Commission has determined that a pipeline is in full compliance
with the requirements of Order No. 636, that pipeline will not be required to submit Form 592 to the Commission. The
order further stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and to provide its affiliated transportation log
information on its EBB. Finally, the order stated, in practice, this means that pipelines remain subject to the standards
of conduct and will continue to maintain the information mandated by Order Nos. 497 and 636, but will not be required
to file Form 592 with the Commission. 

On January 4, 1993, requests for rehearing were filed by the Indicated Parties (consisting of Conoco, Inc., Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., Chevron U.S.A., Inc., and Texaco Inc.), Hadson Gas Systems, Inc. (Hadson), National Fuel Gas Supply
Corporation (National Fuel), the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), ANR Pipeline Company and
Colorado Interstate Gas Company (ANR and CIG), the Joint Parties (consisting of Williams Gas Marketing Company,
Consolidated Natural Gas Company, Midcon Marketing Corp., and Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.), CNG Transmission Corporation
(CNG), Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), and Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark). Their requests
are discussed below. 



IV. Discussion 



A. The Revised Contemporaneous Disclosure Requirement 



1. Requests for Rehearing 



A number of pipelines (National Fuel, INGAA, ANR, CIG, Tenneco, CNG, and Northwest) and the Joint Parties assert that
the Commission should eliminate from  161.3(f) the requirement that sales and marketing information given
to a marketing affiliate must be contemporaneously disclosed to all potential shippers because it is inconsistent
with the court's decision in 

Tenneco.

 

The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that the revised standard provides a limited exclusion for sales and marketing
information that is available from public sources or is related to off-system sales or marketing transactions not
involving the system of an affiliated pipeline but there is no explanation in Order No. 497-D as to how so limited
an exclusion can be interpreted as responsive to the court's remand. The pipelines and Joint Parties argue that the
Commission's assumption that pipelines obtain sales and marketing information in connection with or when combined
with transportation is not responsive to the court's directive to provide an independent justification for barring
the exchange of sales or marketing information that is wholly unrelated to transportation information. The pipelines
and the Joint Parties submit that Order No. 497-D evidences neither the independent justification required
by the court, nor a consideration of the action on remand which was suggested by the court. The pipelines and the Joint
Parties assert that the Commission has not examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation
for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. They argue that the result
is an arbitrary and capricious order which is unsupported by substantial evidence.

The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that Order No. 497-D is inconsistent with Order No. 636. They assert
that the Commission has unequivocally found in Order No. 636 that sales services are competitive and has set in motion
a restructuring of the pipeline industry that is intended to result in competition for sales on an even basis by producers,
pipelines, and marketers. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that Order No. 497-D is at odds with Order
No. 636 in its assumption (which is unsupported by record evidence) that pipelines possess sales and marketing information
which flows from the pipelines' anticompetitive market power. They state that, as the Commission documented in Order
No. 636, most pipeline industry market power has already been eliminated, and some individual companies have completed
the transition to competitiveness by unbundling. They further state that to remove the last vestiges of pipeline
market power, as the Commission sees it in Order No. 636, an industry-wide unbundling is to be in place by the start of
the 1993-94 heating season. 

The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that in light of unbundling under Order No. 636, it is inexplicable how the
Commission could see a need to re-promulgate standard (f) with regard to sales and marketing information. They state
that when Order No. 497 was issued, prior to unbundling, the Commission's intent was to prevent preferential treatment
of an affiliated marketer by an interstate pipeline in the provision of transportation services. The pipelines and
the Joint Parties state that, as recognized by the Commission, pipelines have no monopoly power over sales. They assert
that it is only a pipeline's transportation function which even arguably puts it in a position of being able to favor
its own marketing affiliates. Consequently, they argue that the standards of conduct under Order No. 497 should only
apply to pipeline transportation information. 

The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that the new contemporaneous disclosure requirement in Order No. 497-D
imposes unnecessary and unreasonable burdens upon pipelines. They state that, as Chair Moler noted in her dissent
to Order No. 497-D, the standards of conduct under Order No. 497 already preclude pipelines from disclosing
to marketing affiliates any information obtained from non-affiliated shippers, or otherwise giving any advantages
or preferences to their marketing affiliates in the provision of transportation service. The pipelines and the Joint
Parties assert that these requirements effectively prevent pipelines from using any remaining market power they
have over transportation services to benefit their marketing affiliates, and make the Order No. 497-D disclosure
requirements unnecessary. The pipelines and the Joint Parties do not believe that in light of all of the current competition
in the natural gas industry, pipelines have significant market power over transportation service. However, to the
extent there is any remaining market power over transportation service, the pipelines and the Joint Parties argue
that the Order No. 497 standards of conduct adequately address this issue without a need for the contemporaneous disclosure
requirement for sales and marketing information. They submit that the Commission's imposition of the Order No. 497-D
contemporaneous disclosure requirement only serves to benefit pipeline competitors, and imposes unnecessary
burdens on pipelines. 

The pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that the Commission cites no evidence to support its critical conclusion
that the sales and marketing information that a pipeline derives from its ongoing relationship with its customers
is a product of either past or present anticompetitive market power. They assert that the Commission's error on this
point is exacerbated by its lack of jurisdiction to regulate the disclosure of sales or marketing information at all.
The pipelines and Joint Parties state, as the court noted, because the Commission is authorized to regulate only those
practices that are unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission appears to lack the authority to prevent
pipelines from preferring their affiliates with exclusive access to sales or marketing information unless that
sort of preference is undue. The pipelines and Joint Parties contend that the Commission cannot resolve questions
about the very existence of its authority based on nothing more than its sense that the informational advantages that
a gas marketer derives from an affiliated pipeline result from anticompetitive market power rather than the economic
efficiencies of vertical integration. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that the contemporaneous disclosure
requirement also exceeds the Commission's lawful authority because the Commission is only empowered to act with
respect to any transportation or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. They state that
the contemporaneous disclosure requirement apparently applies to the sharing of information regardless of whether
a jurisdictional service is being performed. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that there is plainly no lawful
basis for the Commission to extend its regulation to non-jurisdictional services. 

The pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that even assuming that the pipeline generates certain sales and marketing
information that is not publicly available, mere sharing of this information with an affiliate does not translate
into a transportation advantage for an affiliate, 

i.e., 

even if the pipeline informs an affiliate of a potential sales market, that does not mean that the pipeline can automatically
provide the affiliate with the transportation capacity necessary to complete the deal. Indeed, they assert that
the affording of such a preference is precluded under  161.3(c) which states that a pipeline may not give its
marketing affiliate preference over nonaffiliated customers in matters relating to part 284 transportation, including,
but not limited to, scheduling, balancing, transportation, storage, or curtailment priority. The pipelines and
the Joint Parties contend that all the Commission's contemporaneous disclosure requirement does is to limit the
flow of information in the market in a manner which hinders competition and serves no legitimate purpose.

The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that with the issuance of Order No. 636, and the restructuring of all interstate
pipelines, pipelines will no longer retain any transportation capacity. They state that Order No. 636 prohibits
a pipeline from retaining or obtaining capacity downstream of the point of unbundling on its system except for storage
needed for system management and balancing for no-notice service, and thus all capacity will be allocated to the pipeline's
shippers. The pipelines and the Joint Parties state that with all of the pipeline's capacity in the hands of its shippers,
the pipeline will have no control over when the capacity will become available. They state that availability will
depend, to a large degree, on its release by firm shipper through the pipeline's capacity release program. Moreover,
they state when the capacity does become available (either through the release program or as interruptible transportation),
the pipeline will have no control over who will get the capacity. They state that the decision will be solely determined
by price paid and other objective criteria as specified by the releasing shipper and/or in the pipeline's tariff.
The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that even if a pipeline knew of a particular gas supply and a demand for gas
in a particular location and proceeded to pass that information on to its affiliate, no preferential treatment with
respect to the provision of transportation services could result. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that
as Order No. 636 has dispelled the potential for a pipeline to grant an undue preference with respect to transportation
services (the purported reason behind Order No. 497), the Commission's newly revised contemporaneous disclosure
requirement constitutes nothing more than an arbitrary prohibition against the normal interactions between affiliates,
in a manner which places pipeline marketing affiliates at an unjustified disadvantage. 

Northwest requests that the Commission clarify that it will not apply standard (f) to any conduct regarding sales
or marketing information prior to the effective date of Order No. 497-D. 

Tenneco requests that the Commission clarify that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for information
regarding on-system sales and marketing information conveyed by the pipeline to its marketing affiliate applies
only to the transmission of information by the transportation personnel of the pipeline and not to transmission of
information by the unbundled merchant personnel of the pipeline. Tenneco believes that such a clarification is reasonable
because in the post-Order No. 636 environment the unbundled merchant will be the functional equivalent of a marketing
affiliate because it will not have market power over the sale of natural gas. Further, the pipeline merchant personnel
will be required to operate under the exact same restraints with respect to the pipeline transportation personnel
that marketing affiliate personnel are required to abide by. 



2. Commission Ruling



In 

Tenneco, 

the court found that ``the contemporaneous disclosure requirement_at least as it affects information regarding
transportation, where pipelines have monopolistic market power_reflects a reasonable effort to promote a competitive
market without significantly harming existing efficiencies.''

11

 However, with respect to the contemporaneous disclosure of gas sales and marketing information, the court stated
that based on the record it was ``unable to conclude that standard (f)'s application to sales and marketing is justified;
nor can we be confident that FERC possessed the statutory authority to regulate the transfer of sales and marketing
information from pipelines to their affiliates.''

12

 The court remanded the proceeding to the Commission and stated that ``[o]n remand, the Commission should consider
its justification for applying standard (f) to sales and marketing information and ensure that the final requirement
is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market and benefitting consumers, as well
as preventing undue discrimination.''

13

 Upon further review of the issues raised with respect to the disclosure of certain categories of sales and marketing
information and in light of the court's findings, the substantive protection of other standards of conduct (particularly
standard(e)),

14

 structural changes in the industry, and the restructuring mandated by Order No. 636, the Commission will delete from
the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of standard (f) the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing
information. Pipelines with marketing affiliates will only be required to contemporaneously disclose information
related to the transportation of natural gas. The Commission now believes that to impose a general requirement of
contemporaneous disclosure of non-transportation information could have a chilling effect on pipelines marketing
their gas and does not with any degree of certainty improve the market nor benefit consumers. But while we are limiting
the reach of standard (f), pipelines are not relieved of their obligations to refrain from unduly discriminatory
conduct that is prohibited under the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, whether or not that conduct is covered
by standard (f) or any of the other standards. Moreover, while the Commission does not choose to continue a standard
requiring contemporaneous disclosure of certain categories of sales and marketing information at this time, this
does not bar the Commission from examining such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases.

The court questioned standard (f)'s applicability to information generated by the pipeline ``from public sources,
or other sources entirely unrelated to a pipeline's transportation service.''

15

 The court also questioned the Commission's assertion ``that the sales and marketing information pipelines use today
is a result of their 

`past 

monopoly power over transportation.'''

16

 Noting that the marketing of gas depended on current_not past_information, the court found the Commission's position
``counter-intuitive.''

17

 The court stated:






The Commission appears to believe that 

any 

advantage a pipeline gives its marketing affiliate is improper * * * . But advantages a pipeline gives
its affiliate are improper only to the extent that they flow from the pipeline's anti-competitive market power.

18

 



Examined in this light, the Commission now believes that standard (f) should be narrowed to affect only the disclosure
of information related to the transportation of gas. 



Historically, the pipeline collected and maintained extensive data on natural gas supply and markets. As the primary_if
not exclusive_buyer and seller of natural gas, pipelines had all of the data on production, consumption and markets
for the areas they served. However, pipelines today are not the dominant sellers of natural gas they were a decade ago.
About 80 percent of the natural gas pipelines deliver today is shipper-owned gas. Indeed, after the Order No. 636-mandated
restructuring process is complete, nearly 100 percent of natural gas deliveries will be shipper-owned gas. Also,
other structural changes in the industry further weaken the pipeline's knowledge base. Increasingly, contract
pricing relies on nationwide competitive and financial market determinations, such as the NYMEX futures market,
and published spot prices. Also, Order No. 636 establishes a short-term capacity release program for transactions
less than 30 days in duration where even the EBB bidding requirements are waived. Pipelines will be afforded substantially
less information about these types of transactions than traditionally required. For these transactions pipelines
know where the gas is entering their system, and where it is redelivered, but may know nothing about the extent of reserves,
the producers' or consumers' circumstances, or the commercial terms of the sale itself. Often the pipeline does not
even know the identity of the ultimate consumer. Indeed the theory underlying Order No. 636 is that shippers would
have more access to producers and marketers to make their decisions. 

But just as important is the fact that other shippers and producers will know where gas is entering and being redelivered
throughout the system. Order No. 636 requires that this type of information be provided during the restructuring
process, and through the EBB posting requirement required during the right-of-first-refusal, and capacity release
programs. 

To the extent that a pipeline collects sales and marketing information from public sources, or from sources outside
its transportation role, release of this information to its marketing affiliate generally does not in any way relate
to the pipeline's monopoly power over transportation. Unnecessary interference with communications between a
pipeline and its marketing affiliates would actually reduce competition, by inhibiting one segment of the industry
from vigorously competing with other natural gas sellers. To do otherwise would create an unlevel playing field tilted
against pipeline merchant service units or marketing affiliates and towards producers, nonaffiliated marketers,
local distribution companies (LDCs), and others. Rather than a balanced approach, this tilted playing field would
give an unfair advantage to non-pipeline merchants. 
The pipeline obtains sales and marketing information from the public domain, its bundled merchant function or its
transportation activities. The public domain information should not trigger standard (f), following the 

Tenneco

 court's reasoning. The bundled merchant information is outdated and does not meet the current information standard
mentioned by the court. And finally, the transportation-generated sales and marketing information cannot be shared
with the affiliate in the first instance given the standard (e) prohibition.

19

 





Standards (f) and (e) are compatible with respect to transportation information_pipelines could generate and communicate
transportation information to their marketing affiliates without violating standard (e). For example, as a result
of its own engineering flow analysis, a pipeline could develop information concerning capacity availability. If
that information is shared with a marketing affiliate, standard (f) is triggered. But since the information was not
obtained by the pipeline from a nonaffiliated shipper or potential shipper, standard (e) is not violated.

<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to the protections provided by standard (e), standard (c) also provides an adequate safeguard against
affiliate abuse. Standard (c) states: 




[A pipeline] may not, through a tariff provision or otherwise, give its marketing affiliate preference over nonaffiliated
customers in matters relating to part 284 transportation including, but not limited to, scheduling, balancing,
transportation, storage, or curtailment priority.

20

 



While these reasons themselves compel modification of standard (f), further changes in the industry structure,
and in pipelines' operations mandated by Order No. 636 provide additional support. Order No. 636 will both level the
playing field for all competitors, and increase the amount of capacity information available from EBBS to all potential
shippers_marketing affiliates and all other sellers, marketers, transporters and consumers alike. 

First, Order No. 636 requires pipelines to unbundle their own sales from the transportation service. To do this each
pipeline is required to establish separate operating staffs for pipeline (transportation) operations and merchant
operations (merchant function operating unit). Each pipeline is also required to treat its merchant function operating
unit as if it were a marketing affiliate, for purposes of compliance with the standards of conduct and reporting requirements
of Order No. 497, 

et seq. 

In practice, many pipelines are establishing separate affiliates to provide the merchant services required by Order
No. 636. This change should further reduce the likelihood that a pipeline would even have sales or marketing information
to pass along to its marketing affiliate (or merchant function operating unit). Indeed, whatever sales and marketing
information a pipeline would have developed from public sources would, for the most part, be available to all other
competitors on a similar basis. 

In 

Tenneco 

the court found 




[N]o evidence in the record_and FERC points to none_for the assertion that the sales and marketing information pipelines
use today is a result of their ``

past 

monopoly over transportation.'' The [FERC's] assertion strikes us as counter-intuitive. The sales and marketing
of gas would seem to depend on 

current 

information_a surmise that 

is

 supported by evidence in the record that pipelines' sales and marketing information includes information developed
through ongoing customer calls and reviews of filings with state and federal regulatory agencies, trade publications,
and market reports.

21

 




This represents a significant change from past practices. When pipelines were the primary merchants in the interstate
marketplace, merchant services were provided under long-term contracts on an ``on demand'' basis. While the pipelines
had all of the industry's information available to them, and operational control over all of the functions, this information
was aggregated over both time (monthly) and markets. Increasingly, today's merchant services focus on individual
customers and are adjustable on a daily or even hourly basis. The information needed to drive the old-style merchant
services is neither compatible with nor sufficient to meet the demands of today's marketplace. 

Second, all future sales of gas will take place at pipeline receipt or pooling points. This requires that the pipeline,
acting as a merchant, and the pipeline's marketing affiliates must sell gas at the same point on the system as other
gas sellers. This places all other natural gas sellers on a level playing field with marketing affiliates and the pipeline
as a merchant. And because the Commission has mandated that pipelines allow all shippers flexible receipt, pooling,
and delivery point authority, all shippers should have equal access to available capacity throughout the system.
The designation of pooling points, the pipeline's point of sale for merchant services, and the terms and conditions
governing flexible point authority are all subject to negotiations among the pipeline and the parties in individual
restructuring proceedings_not subject to the pipeline's sole discretion to decide. The result of negotiations
over these significant operating terms and conditions must ultimately be filed by the pipelines as part of their FERC
tariffs and apply equitably to all shippers whether they purchase from the pipeline or anyone else. 

Third, pipelines are encouraged in the Order No. 636 restructuring process to minimize transition costs by assigning_on
a voluntary non-discriminatory basis_gas supply contracts to their former sales customers. Pipelines are also
allowed 100 percent recovery of transition costs. These transition provisions are designed to fairly distribute
the burden of the historic legacy of uncompetitive pipeline purchase arrangements. Coupled with removal of burdensome
regulatory pricing structures, pipeline merchant function operating units should be left in a position to compete
fairly with other merchants without being saddled with the costs of uncompetitive purchase contracts. 

Fourth, Order No. 636 requires pipelines to establish and maintain EBBs and requires that EBB personnel function
independently of the gas marketing personnel to the maximum extent practicable. Identification of some of the data
to be maintained on the EBB is the subject of negotiation between the pipeline and the parties to the restructuring
proceedings. However, other data are required by Order No. 636 to be on the EBB at all times, 

e.g., 

length of release, rate, quantity, criteria for bid evaluation (which criteria was determined during the restructuring
proceeding) and the pipeline must identify all capacity on its system which is available directly from the pipeline.
Implementation of these EBBs will give all shippers and potential shippers instant access to the most current information
about the availability of pipeline capacity. 

Finally, Order No. 636 creates a capacity releasing program. Under this program, firm shippers of the pipeline are
allowed to resell their capacity, in whole or in part, and under terms and conditions they choose, to the highest bidding
replacement shipper. Releasing shippers are also allowed to include specific provisions for the recall of released
capacity, 

e.g., 

when temperatures drop below a pre-set minimum level. Releases may be either permanent or temporary, firm or interruptible.
Coupled with flexible receipt and delivery point authority, the capacity release program will allow existing firm
shippers to sell their capacity in the pipeline to others. This will create competition for capacity against the pipeline
itself. Although the pipeline would continue to operate the system, it would no longer be in sole control over who has
access to capacity. Again, the pipelines and their shippers are expected to work together in implementing the Order
No. 636 restructuring process to decide how the pipeline will operate in the new unbundled world. 

With respect to Northwest's request, the Commission clarifies that it will not apply standard (f) to any conduct regarding
sales or marketing information prior to the effective date of Order No. 497-D.

Tenneco's request that the Commission clarify that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for information
regarding on-system sales and marketing information conveyed by the pipeline to its marketing affiliate applies
only to the transmission of information by the transportation personnel of the pipeline and not to transmission of
information by the unbundled merchant personnel of the pipeline is moot. The Commission notes, however, that standard
(f), in any form, applies only to the pipeline in its relationship with its marketing affiliate, and now, because of
Order No. 636, its unbundled merchant division is the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.



B. The Elimination of the Filing of Form 592 



1. Requests for Rehearing 



The Indicated Parties assert that the Commission erred in permitting interstate pipelines to cease to submit the
affiliated transportation log (Form 592) 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline
is in full compliance with Order No. 636. The Indicated Parties submit that the information available on Form 592 may
be more essential after a pipeline complies fully with Order No. 636 than it is now. The Indicated Parties state that
following full compliance with Order No. 636, an interstate pipeline will be permitted to sell natural gas at negotiated
prices. In this environment, the Indicated Parties argue that such a pipeline may be motivated to favor its own sales
of gas as well as sales made by its marketing affiliates. For example, the Indicated Parties contend that to obtain
a sale at the expense of other sellers, a pipeline could sell its gas at a loss or a very low price, but charge the full transportation
rate. The Indicated Parties assert that this would allow the pipeline to avoid the correlative discount rule under
 161.3(i), and charge all other sellers the maximum transportation rate rather than discounting to obtain
the transportation business. The Indicated Parties argue that to remain competitive, non-affiliated sellers would
be forced to reduce their gas prices below what they would charge if the pipeline discounted its transportation rates
rather than the price at which the pipeline merchant function sells its gas. The Indicated Parties contend that the
non-affiliated sellers would suffer a loss because they would be forced to sell their gas at a loss and pay the full transportation
rate. The Indicated Parties assert that the pipeline, however, would not suffer the same economic detriment because
it would receive the full transportation rate on the movement of its gas. The Indicated Parties submit that they and
other competing merchants will be unable to monitor and detect such favoritism without the information provided
on Form 592. 

The Indicated Parties assert that the difficulty with the elimination of the filing of Form 592 is that the Commission
and the industry have no experience with the operation of EBBs by a pipeline in full compliance with Order No. 636. The
Indicated Parties argue that the Commission cannot find that the EBBs will prove to be a reliable and accurate source
of the information now supplied on Form 592. The Indicated Parties state that in light of this practical experience,
the Commission recently requested comments on the configuration and operation of EBBs in Docket No. RM93-4-000.
The Indicated Parties state that in the list of questions on which comments were requested the Commission asked whether
``any of this information [available on the EBBs can] be used to fulfill existing FERC reporting requirements?''
The Indicated Parties contend that this request demonstrates that the EBBs are an unproven means of communicating
the information now available on Form 592. The Indicated Parties state that even though it had requested comments
on whether it could eliminate any of its current reporting requirements, the Commission, without even waiting for
an answer to its question, erroneously assumed in Order No. 497-D that the answer would be ``yes'' and eliminated
one of its reporting requirements. The Indicated Parties submit that the disparity between the requests for comments
and the elimination of a reporting requirement in Order No. 497-D demonstrates that the Commission acted in
an arbitrary and capricious manner without substantial evidence in eliminating the filing of Form 592. The Indicated
Parties assert that the Commission has failed to protect the public interest with its elimination of the requirement
that pipelines file Form 592. The Indicated Parties argue that the Commission should grant rehearing and reinstate
the requirement that pipelines file Form 592. 

Hadson also asserts that the Commission erred in eliminating the filing of Form 592. Hadson states that under Order
No. 636 pipelines will be able to conduct an essentially deregulated gas merchant business under the pipeline's corporate
entity and while sharing key personnel. Hadson contends that this arrangement, which it does not oppose in and of itself,
nonetheless creates additional opportunities for the pipeline-transporter to favor both its own merchant division
as well as its affiliates and that this increases rather than diminishes the need for public scrutiny. Hadson argues
that, at a minimum, deregulating the pipeline-merchant can certainly not be invoked as grounds for a decrease in the
need for public monitoring by the industry watchdog. Finally, Hadson notes that even requiring the same information
to be disclosed on an EBB is materially different from requiring the information to be filed with the Commission under
the Natural Gas Act since filings with the Commission are subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 while postings on an EBB are probably
not.

Tenneco asserts that while the Commission recognized in Order No. 497-D that the EBB requirements in Order No.
636 obviate the need for pipelines to file Form 592 with the Commission, the Commission failed to recognize that certain
information currently required in Form 592 will have little use to anyone in the post-Order No. 636 world. 

Tenneco states that Item Nos. 7 and 8 require that a pipeline report the position of its marketing affiliate in the pipeline's
transportation queue and the total number of requests in the queue respectively. Tenneco submits that in the unbundled
world pipelines will allocate available capacity among requesting shippers not on a first-come, first-served basis,
but on the basis of the relative value of the request to the pipeline. Tenneco states that the value of the requests for
transportation will involve a calculation based on the price offered and the term of the request, and the precise method
of determining which offer has the highest value to the pipeline will be stated in the pipeline's tariff. Tenneco asserts
that without a first-come, first-served queue in effect, there is no advantage to be gained by maintaining these two
information requirements. Tenneco further asserts that the pipeline capacity release programs will provide yet
another avenue through which shippers desiring firm transportation capacity can obtain it, thus further reducing
the utility of the required information. Tenneco contends that these changes brought about by Order No. 636 will thus
eliminate the need for pipelines to report the queue position of their marketing affiliates and the total number of
requests in the queue. 

Tenneco states that Item Nos. 23 and 24 require pipelines to report whether or not the pipeline will receive take-or-pay
credits for transporting an affiliate's gas and what percentage of the gas transported will be subject to credit.
Tenneco states that because the Commission's take-or-pay crediting program terminated on December 31, 1990, pipelines
have not been able to receive take-or-pay credits since December 31, 1990. Therefore, Tenneco asserts that maintaining
this requirement serves no purpose. 

Tenneco states that Item No. 32 requires pipelines to identify the location of the producing fields from which gas
requested to be transported for an affiliate originates. Tenneco argues that with the implementation of flexible
receipt and delivery points and capacity release, this information becomes useless. Tenneco contends that shippers
will be using secondary receipt points on their own contracts and acquiring each other's capacity much more than they
have historically. Tenneco asserts that this is precisely the outcome that the Commission is trying to bring about
by mandating flexible receipt and delivery points and capacity release. Tenneco submits that with this increase
in the number of transportation transactions that involve the use of points other than the primary receipt or delivery
point of the entity requesting transportation, requiring pipelines to report this information serves no purpose.


Tenneco states that Record No. 3 requires pipelines to report requested receipt and delivery points for transportation
requests of their marketing affiliates. Tenneco asserts that the advent of flexible receipt and delivery points
renders this information useless. Tenneco argues that the marketing affiliate, like any other shipper, will have
the firm right to use any receipt or delivery point on the system to the extent that capacity is available. Thus, Tenneco
contends the utility of maintaining a list of requested receipt and delivery points is vastly diminished. 

Because the information required by Item Nos. 7, 8, 23, 24, and 32 of Schedule 2 and all of Schedule 3 will no longer have
value after full compliance with Order No. 636, Tenneco requests that the Commission clarify that this information
need not be maintained on pipelines' EBBs. Tenneco asserts that eliminating the requirement to report it is consistent
with the Commission's goal to decrease needlessly burdensome regulation. Tenneco requests expedited action on
this issue as pipelines are currently setting up their EBBs, and a swift affirmative response will enable the new EBBs
to more accurately reflect the required information.

2. Commission Ruling 



The Commission denies the Indicated Parties' and Hadson's requests for rehearing. Their arguments lose sight of
the fact that the Form 592 information must still be provided electronically, thus allowing interested parties and
the Commission staff to monitor the activities of pipelines and their affiliates and to initiate the appropriate
action when evidence of discrimination in favor of affiliates exists. The Indicated Parties' concerns about obtaining
reliable and accurate Form 592 information are unfounded. Section 250.16(g)(2) states that:

 


An interstate pipeline must provide 24-hour access, by electronic means, to the data specified in paragraph (b)(2)
of this section. Access to the information must be provided once the service has begun. A pipeline must, on a daily basis,
either update the information or indicate that no changes have occurred in the log information. 


 


Most pipelines satisfied this requirement through the use of EBBs in the past, and Order No. 636 now mandates EBBs.
Interested parties have been receiving and will continue to receive the Form 592 information electronically. Thus,
the Indicated Parties' argument that the Commission and the industry have no experience with EBBs is inaccurate.
Moreover, the requirements of Order No. 636 ensure that each pipeline's Order No. 497 EBB must provide for: (a) Downloading
by users; (b) daily back-up of information, which must be available for at least three years; (c) purging information
on completed transactions from current files; (d) display of most recent entries ahead of information posted earlier;
and (e) on-line help, a search function and a menu that permits users to separately access records in the transportation
log and standards of conduct information.

22

 These features allow shippers to take the information that is currently filed on Form 592s off the pipelines' EBBs
and obtain access to the information up to three years after it is posted.

23

 In these circumstances, the burden on the pipelines from filing Form 592s and the administrative burden on the Commission
from collecting them outweighs any benefits of collecting the data in hard copy. 






The Commission also does not believe that Hadson's argument relying on 18 U.S.C. 1001 is a valid reason for maintaining
the Form 592 filing requirement. Section 1001 states: 



Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully
falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or
fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain
false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than
five years, or both. 


 




Hadson's argument implies that because a hard copy of the Form 592 information will not be filed with the Commission
pipelines will knowingly provide inaccurate or incorrect information through electronic means. The Commission
believes that the language of the statute is broad enough to cover electronic postings. However, in order to prevent
any such fraudulent conduct, the Commission deems the electronic posting of the Form 592 information equivalent
to a filing for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001. 



Since contemporaneously with this order the Commission is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) which proposes
to revise Order No. 497's reporting requirements, including Form 592, the Commission will not address Tenneco's
request to delete certain parts of Form 592. 



C. Application of Order No. 497 to Ozark 



1. Request for Rehearing 



Ozark asserts that the Commission's order on remand ignores the court's instructions requiring the Commission to
consider the effect of Ozark's evidence on the question of control. Ozark contends that it simply relies upon an equally
deficient rationale for concluding, without reference to any evidence, that Tennessee Ozark and Ozark Pipeline
Corporation each, individually, ``controls'' Ozark, thereby making the marketing affiliates of those partners
marketing affiliates of Ozark. Ozark submits that to avoid problems inherent in finding that these partners can exercise
``affirmative control'' over Ozark, the Commission concluded that they can exercise ``negative control'' by simply
withholding their vote and vetoing any transportation transaction that would compete with their respective marketing
affiliates.

<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Ozark argues that the ability to withhold a vote or ``veto'' any particular transaction does not exist as far as open
access transportation arrangements are concerned. Ozark states that open access pipelines, including Ozark, are
required by   284.8(b) and 284.9(b) to transport natural gas on an open and non-discriminatory basis.
Ozark asserts that it is clearly prohibited from taking actions that would unduly prefer the marketing affiliates
of Ozark's partners and Ozark's partners have an obligation to the partnership to operate the pipeline within legal
parameters. 

Ozark submits that its Commission-approved firm and interruptible rate schedules establish the criteria which
control who receives transportation service from Ozark. Ozark contends that decisions as to who will be permitted
to ship on Ozark may not be made at the whim of a particular Ozark partner. Ozark asserts that if the tariff criteria are
met, the request must be granted. Ozark states that, in fact, at a Management Committee meeting held on June 26, 1991,
Ozark's Management Committee, consisting of representatives of each of the partners, voted unanimously to approve
a resolution authorizing the President of Ozark or his designee to execute interruptible transportation agreements
on behalf of Ozark. Thus, Ozark contends, each of the partners ceded to the Operator the authority to enter into interruptible
transportation agreements. Ozark argues that no partnership vote is required and the Operator is bound by the tariff.
Ozark asserts that it should be obvious that not only are Tennessee Ozark and Ozark Pipeline Corporation not free to
veto transportation transactions but each has relinquished any right it might otherwise have to vote on such transactions.


Ozark submits that the record before the Commission shows an absence of control. Ozark asserts that the record before
the Commission shows a complete absence of any vetoing of any transportation transaction by any Ozark partner, consistent
with the delegation of authority to enter into such transportation agreements. Ozark argues that the Operator is
required to act in accordance with its fiduciary responsibilities to the partnership, not inconsistent with those
responsibilities. Ozark contends that the Commission's finding here that one partner could prefer its marketing
affiliate by vetoing transportation for others is directly contrary to the Commission's prior findings in this case
that ``[t]here are no facts before us in this proceeding which indicate that Ozark has discriminated in offering transportation
services to any party.''

24

 





Ozark submits that previously the Commission assumed that the Ozark partners would act together to provide preferences
to marketing affiliates of one of the partners or that one of the Ozark partners would be willing to grant preferences
to their Ozark partners in the hopes of obtaining reciprocal preferences. Ozark states that here the Commission assumes
that one of the partners will simply veto transactions that would benefit the partnership because the transaction
might compete with a transaction of one of its affiliates. Ozark asserts that there is no evidence to support any such
assumption. Ozark contends that to make such a finding the Commission would have to assume that Ozark would violate
its tariff, the Commission's regulations, and Texas partnership law. Ozark argues that the Commission would also
have to assume that its prior finding that there are no facts showing discrimination in Ozark's offering of transportation
is wrong. Ozark submits that not one of these assumptions is logical, consistent with any information relating to
Ozark, or supported by evidence in the record. Ozark asserts that all of the evidence shows that such control does not
exist including the fact that numerous transportation transactions have been conducted by Ozark for independent
marketers which compete with the marketing affiliates of Ozark partners. 

Ozark states that its decisions as to who it will ship for are subject to review by this Commission and this Commission's
complaint procedures. Ozark contends that if the Commission were to find that Ozark had engaged in such conduct, enforcement
proceedings would commence and Ozark would either be ordered to provide the service required or its blanket certificate
would be revoked. 

Finally, Ozark argues that it does not control any of its individual partners, is not controlled by any of its individual
partners, and is not under common control with any of its individual partners. It asserts that nothing in the record
before the Commission suggests the contrary. 

Ozark also contends that the Commission erred to the extent that it relied on the modified definition of ``control.''
Ozark states that in Order No. 497-A the Commission modified the definition of ``control'' in  161.2.
Ozark states that on January 16, 1990, it sought rehearing of Order No. 497-A. Ozark states that the Commission
issued an order granting rehearing for purpose of further consideration but the Commission has never, to the best
of Ozark's knowledge, issued an order on the merits of Ozark's rehearing request. Ozark states that three years have
passed and numerous orders utilizing the definition have issued, including the order in this proceeding, and it considers
its request for rehearing as having been denied. However, to the extent that the Commission is applying the revised
definition to support the result here, Ozark seeks rehearing.

<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Ozark asserts that the Commission's order is not at all clear whether it is relying upon the modified definition of
``control'' to support its decision here. If the Commission's decision rests at all on ``whether acting alone or in
conjunction with others'' language, Ozark submits that the Commission's decision is in error. Ozark argues that
the effect of the additional language is to establish ``control'' in a 1% voting interest owner of a corporation. Ozark
asserts that the language creates an irrebuttable presumption of ``control'' by anyone holding at least a 10% voting
interest in a corporation, contrary to the clear statement in the balance of the regulation that the presumption of
control is rebuttable. Ozark contends these two effects result from the indisputable fact that any interest holder
must act with the requisite plurality in order for any particular action to be taken by a corporation or a partnership.
Ozark states that in its case unanimity is required for most actions so all partners must vote in the affirmative in
order for particular action to be taken. Ozark asserts that the fact that unanimity is required, again, does not constitute
control but, rather, evidences a lack of control. Accordingly, Ozark submits that the modified definition is inconsistent
with the existence of a rebuttable presumption, is arbitrary and capricious, and lacks any basis in reasoned decisionmaking.




2. Commission Ruling 



The Commission rejects Ozark's request for rehearing. Ozark argues that the Commission's definition of ``control''
is inconsistent with the existence of a rebuttable presumption. We disagree. Section 161.2 states that ``control
(including the terms `controlling,' `controlled by,' and `under common control with') includes, but is not limited
to, the possession, directly or indirectly and whether acting alone or in conjunction with others, of the authority
to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a company. A voting interest of 10 percent or more creates
a rebuttable presumption of control.''

25

 In Order No. 497-A, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of joint venture pipelines and stated that
overlapping interests create an incentive to grant an affiliate preference.

26

 The Commission applied the definition in section 161.2 to several pipelines that had requested rehearing, including
High Island Offshore System, U-T Offshore System, Trailblazer Pipeline Company, Sea Robin Pipeline Company,
Northern Border Pipeline Company and Great Lakes Gas Transmission Company.

27

 In 

Tenneco,

 the court upheld the definition of control and the way in which the Commission applied it to Northern Border Pipeline
Company. In considering Ozark's petition for review, the court remanded the Commission's 

application

 of the term ``control'' but not the definition of the term. Thus, Ozark's request for review of the definition of control
is a collateral attack on Order No. 497-A and the Commission rejects it. 







To consider whether there is control here, we will review all the evidence Ozark has submitted on the issue. On March
10, 1987, Ozark filed an application under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity. In that application, Ozark stated that it is a partnership and submitted its partnership agreement,
which shows that Ozark is jointly owned by four partners,

28

 that the partnership will be managed by a management committee, which will consist of equal representatives from
each partner, and will be operated by OPGC. In addition, OPGC selects the President of Ozark, who also acts as the CEO
and the Chairman of the management committee. On July 5, 1988, Ozark emphasized that its General Partnership agreement
specifies that no action may be taken by the management committee except by unanimous approval. On January 3, 1993,
Ozark presented, for the first time, a partial copy of a corporate resolution dated June 26, 1991. This states that
``the President of Ozark or his designee is hereby authorized to execute interruptible transportation agreements
on behalf of Ozark.'' Because Ozark's partners ceded to the President the authority to enter into interruptible transportation
agreements, no partnership vote is required. All of Ozark's firm capacity is committed to Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. Therefore, Ozark claims that its partners cannot ``control''
transportation either affirmatively or negatively through veto power. 





We disagree. The partners still have authority to direct the management and policies of Ozark and could, at any time,
revoke the authority over interruptible transportation from the President. Moreover, under the terms of the partnership
agreement, OPGC selects the President of Ozark and operates Ozark. OPGC's marketing affiliates ship on Ozark. OPGC
has the requisite control described in section 161.2 of the Commission's regulations because it operates Ozark and,
through the President it selects, manages the pipeline.

<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, ``control'' is not limited to authority over firm or interruptible transportation. Informal actions
of the management committee or the partners could provide the marketing affiliates with significant advantages,
such as non-public transportation information. For example, if Ozark intends to build a new pipeline under Part 284
of the Commission's regulations, the partners could convey that information to their marketing affiliates, and
the marketing affiliates would have an advantage over nonaffiliated marketers in obtaining customers. Likewise,
information with respect to the addition of new receipt of delivery points could be of significant advantage to the
marketing affiliates. 

Ozark also states that it has not discriminated in the past and that no Ozark partner has vetoed any transportation
transactions. Ozark asserts that its operating structure together with its history should serve to successfully
rebut a presumption of control. But the partners' ability to control the management and policies of the pipeline is
not linked to whether Ozark has discriminated in the past. In Order No. 497, the Commission found sufficient anticompetitive
conduct industry-wide to substantiate the need for the rule. The court upheld the rule in 

Tenneco.

 The Commission need not produce evidence of discrimination with respect to each pipeline to justify application
of the rule to any one pipeline. 

Finally, Ozark argues that it is subject to the undue discrimination provisions of section 4 of the NGA and therefore
will not discriminate in favor of its affiliates.

29

 Despite these prohibitions, the Commission found the need for additional guidelines to deter anticompetitive conduct
and concluded in Order No. 497 that standards of conduct and reporting requirements were appropriate.

30

 Ozark's argument that it should not be subject to Order No. 497 because it is subject to other regulations is inconsistent
with the purposes of Order No. 497. 






D. Standards of Conduct Filings 



1. Request for Rehearing 



Hadson asserts that the Commission's procedures for acting on   161.3(j) and 284.286(e) filings are
illegal. Hadson states that the Commission treats these filings as non-tariff filings which are assigned an MG docket
prefix. Hadson states that according to  161.3(j) the filings are made to enable shippers and the Commission
to determine how the pipeline is complying with the substantive standards of conduct. Hadson submits that the filings
cannot achieve this purpose, however, since they are withheld from public notice in the 

Federal Register

 and in the Commission's daily orders. Hadson contends that they are effectively concealed from public view in the
great majority of cases since shippers and other interested members of the public have no way of knowing when to look
to find a new or revised MG filing. 

Hadson states that, moreover, the Commission has ruled that the MG filings are non-adversarial and that the Commission
may therefore rely upon non-public and off-the-record communications in determining whether a pipeline is in compliance
with the substantive standards or not.

31

 Hadson states that the Commission has further ruled that no one may protest or intervene in the non-public proceedings.
Hadson states that any attempt to assert that a compliance filing is not in compliance with the law will be redocketed
in a new proceeding and treated as a complaint in which the erstwhile protestant bears the burden of conducting discovery
to prove that a pipeline's compliance filing is not in compliance with the law, rather than the pipeline being responsible
for showing compliance.
 






Hadson argues that similar problems taint the filings under section 284.286 since Order No. 636 appears to generally
incorporate the existing procedures and relies upon them to support the effective deregulation of the unbundled
pipeline merchants under the Subpart J certificates. Hadson states that the basis for this conclusion is that Order
No. 636 appears to maintain the dichotomy between tariff provisions (which presumably would be made in an MT or successor
docket) and procedures (which filing requirement, the Commission states, would be similar to that of  161.3(j)).

33

 Hadson asserts that the primary difference between the new and the current procedures, and the only apparent reason
for not incorporating  161.3(j) along with the various other sections which were incorporated by reference,
is that the new rules have deleted the statement that the filing will enable shippers and the Commission to determine
how a pipeline is complying with the standards of conduct. 





Hadson contends that the deletion of the phrase is apparently not accidental since it accurately reflects the fact
that the new filing will not enable shippers or any other member of the public to (1) learn how a given pipeline defines
``operating employee'' or how it interprets the phrase ``practicable,'' (2) receive notice of any such filing, (3)
have an opportunity to comment thereon, or (4) obtain a decision based upon public evidence compiled in a public record
in accordance with applicable law. 

Hadson states that faced with the Commission's determination to leave the definitional difficulties to be resolved
in the individual restructuring dockets, it did not seek judicial review of Order No. 636 on these issues and has diligently
raised these points in its comments on various pipelines' proposed Order No. 636 compliance plans. 

Hadson asserts that the issue here is whether the Commission may rely upon what Hadson calls the stealth procedures
of section 161.3(j) for purposes of making its decision in this docket to eliminate the publicly available monitoring
requirement. For the reason set forth above, Hadson submits that the Commission cannot do so.

2. Commission Ruling 



The Commission rejects Hadson's argument that its procedures for acting on  161.3(j) and  284.286(e)
filings prohibit public participation. Hadson misinterprets  284.286(e). It requires pipelines to file
procedures for complying with standards of conduct as part of their publicly noticed compliance filings.

34

 Any interested person can participate in those proceedings and protest pipelines' proposals for complying with
the standards. All the pipelines' compliance filings have been publicly available and Hadson, as well as other interested
persons, have had ample opportunity to comment on those procedures. In fact, Hadson intervened in 91 restructuring
proceedings and filed comments with respect to several pipelines' standards of conduct.

35

 Contrary to Hadson's claims of ``stealth,'' the Commission's decisions with respect to the standards of conduct
will be reviewed in the context of the restructuring proceedings. 






The public also participated in the proceedings in which the Commission reviewed the standards of conduct pipelines
had filed before Order No. 636 required restructuring. Although the Commission labeled these proceedings as ``non-adversarial,''

36

 and invited the public to file complaints,

37

 it also addressed all requests for rehearing of the May 1991 standards of conduct decisions (these dockets have the
prefix MG).

38

 Eight parties sought rehearing of the May 1991 MG orders.

39

 Of those, IGM asked the Commission to address its previous protests.

40

 In the Order on Rehearing, the Commission individually addressed each of IGM's previous allegations concerning
pipelines' implementation of the standards.

41

 Hadson had the same opportunity to file comments and protests in the pipelines' pre-Order No. 636 standards of conduct
(MG) proceedings and did not. 










Finally, Hadson incorrectly states that the Commission treated the MG filings as non-public. These filings are public
and are available through the Commission's Records Information and Management System. In addition, all conversations
that occurred between the Commission staff and pipelines were memorialized in memoranda that were placed in the Commission's
public files.

42

 The public had an opportunity to raise issues concerning those conversations during rehearing of the May 1991 orders.






Therefore, not only are the MG filings public, but contrary to Hadson's assertions, they have no real relation to our
decision to eliminate the requirement to file Form 592s. The MG dockets concern the pipelines' general implementation
of the standards of conduct. In contrast, Form 592 is a log of specific transportation transactions. As stated, we
are eliminating the requirements to file Form 592s because the information contained in them will be available on
pipelines' EBBs.

43

 





However, the Commission does agree that, prospectively, it can facilitate access to pipelines' standards of conduct
filings by publicly noticing them. As a result, the Commission will require all future standards of conduct filings
made under  161.3(j) and all requests for waiver of the standards to include form notices suitable for publishing
in the 

Federal Register

. 



E. Interpretation of ``Operating Employee'' 



In response to questions raised by Hadson and other companies and in order to assist pipelines in their compliance
with the separation of operating personnel as required by Standard G and the reporting requirements of  250.16(b),
the Commission will clarify what type of employee it considers an ``operating employee.'' 

Standard G, 18 CFR 161.3(g), states that ``[t]o the maximum extent practicable a [pipeline's] operating employees
and the operating employees of its marketing affiliate must function independently of each other.'' In addition,
under the reporting requirements of  250.16(b), ``[a]n interstate pipeline must file * * *
(1)[n]ew and existing tariff provisions containing * * * (i) [a] complete list of operating personnel
and facilities shared by the interstate natural gas pipeline and the affiliated marketing or brokering company.''





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940104-0-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While not mandating organizational separation, Standard G ensures against affiliate preference and the discriminatory
dissemination of information by requiring a pipeline to provide, to the maximum extent practicable, for the independent
functioning of ``operating personnel'' of the pipeline and its marketing affiliate. The contemporaneous disclosure
mandate of Standard F requires that to the extent a pipeline provides to a marketing affiliate any information related
to transportation of natural gas, it must provide that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers,
affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Standard G's requirement that operating employees are to function
independently to the maximum extent practicable will help ensure that the opportunity to share such information
is minimized. If, for example, a pipeline and its marketing affiliate could evade the contemporaneous disclosure
requirement simply by using the same person to arrange transportation on the pipeline and market gas for the affiliate,
the rule would be substantially undermined. 

Throughout the rulemaking proceeding, however, the Commission has held that complete divestment, divorcement,
or organizational separation of pipelines and their marketing affiliates is not necessary to prevent the abuses
at which the marketing affiliates rule is aimed. The independent functioning requirement does not require a pipeline
to separate all of its employees from those of a marketing affiliate, but rather only operating employees. This determination
is consistent with the Commission's finding that complete organizational separation is unnecessary and may even
be harmful where divestment chills essential day-to-day communications between the pipeline and its affiliate.


The Commission stated in Order No. 497-A that the phrase ```operating employees' can include officers, directors
and managers as well as non-management employees.''

44

 However, without further clarification of that phrase, pipelines may not be able to identify properly every ``operating
employee,'' especially those shared with their affiliate. Since different pipelines are faced with different practical
circumstances, a person's status as an ``operating employee'' will, in many situations, depend not on his or her occupation
or title, but on his or her actual function within the company. 





To provide further guidance, the Commission interprets ``operating employee'' to mean an individual who has day-to-day
duties and responsibilities for planning, directing, organizing, or carrying out gas-related operations, including
gas transportation, gas sales or gas marketing activities. Examples of operating employees include any member of
the board of directors, officers, managers, supervisors, regulatory and technical personnel with duties involving
day-to-day gas purchasing, marketing, sales, transportation, operations, dispatching, storage, or related activities.
Such operating employees may be expected to receive and use information concerning such functions for the benefit
of the specific entity for which they work directly. Under normal circumstances, employees, including highly-placed
operatives such as members of the board of directors or officers of the corporations, who do not have such duties would
not be likely to receive or use transportation-related information subject to Standard F. To the extent a non-operating
person obtains such information and provides it to the marketing affiliate, the pipeline would be required to disclose
the information contemporaneously pursuant to Standard F. 

Employees with no direct operational responsibilities and whose duties are only supportive in nature need not be
considered operating employees. Examples of non-operating employees include support personnel not engaged in
the day-to-day marketing, sales, transportation or other gas-related operations of the affiliated companies,
clerical and secretarial staff, general office building maintenance personnel, and payroll and general accounting
staff. 



F. Extension of Reporting Requirements 



Finally, the Commission will only extend the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December
31, 1993, until June 30, 1994, because contemporaneously with this order the Commission is issuing a NOPR in Docket
No. RM94-6-000 which, among other things, substantially revises Order No. 497's reporting requirements.
The Commission believes that extending the sunset provision to June 30, 1994, will allow the Commission enough time
to issue a final rule setting forth the new reporting requirements and will also prevent any gaps in the reporting requirements
which would occur if the Commission simply let the sunset provision lapse. 



V. Information Collection Statement



Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require approval of certain information collection requirements
imposed by agency rules.

45

 The subject order does not establish any new information collection requirements and does not reduce the reporting
requirements under FERC-592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, as revised by Commission Order
Nos. 497-D and 636 (OMB Control No. 1902-0157).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940104-0-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The information required under FERC-592 enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under
the NGA and NGPA and will help ensure a viable capacity release market under the Commission's Order No. 636. Specifically,
the required information allows the Commission to review/monitor pipeline transportation, sales, and storage
transactions with its marketing affiliates to deter undue discrimination and to take appropriate action, where
and when necessary. The information is also used by others to indicate whether or not there has been discrimination
in pipeline/affiliate/nonaffiliate transactions. 

The Commission is notifying OMB that there is no change in the FERC-592 reporting requirements as a result of
the subject order and requesting that OMB extend its approval of FERC-592 through June 30, 1994. The 180-day
extension of FERC-592 is necessary to allow the Commission adequate time to prepare a final rule based on the
related NOPR, issued concurrently with this order, in Docket No. RM94-6-000 (Standards of Conduct and
Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions). 

Interested persons may obtain further information by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202)
208-1415]. Comments on the FERC-592 reporting requirements may also be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission]. 



VI. Effective Date 



Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)

46

 generally requires a rule to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 unless good cause is found to shorten the time period. The sunset date for the reporting requirements will expire before
the APA's 30 day publication requirement has been fulfilled thus causing a gap in the reporting requirements. Therefore,
in order to prevent a gap in the rule's reporting requirements, this final rule is effective January 1, 1994.

Revision of Trademark Fees



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is amending the rules of practice in trademark cases. The PTO is announcing that
the fee for filing a trademark application is $245, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Patent and
Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1993. No other fees will be affected by this rulemaking.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule change adjusts the fee for filing a trademark application in accordance with the provisions of Public Law
103-179. The trademark fee increase is required to address long-term funding needs of the trademark functions
of the PTO which cannot be satisfied with the current fee structure.


Statutory Provisions


Section 31 of the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1113), authorizes the Commissioner to establish
fees for the filing and processing of an application for the registration of a trademark or other mark, and for all other
services and materials furnished by the PTO relating to trademarks and other marks.
Public Law 103-179 established the fee for filing a trademark application at $245 per class. Public Law 103-179
took effect on December 3, 1993.


Recovery Level Determinations


The existing fee schedule, along with the adjustment to the trademark application fee, will recover $518,692,000
in fiscal year 1994, of which $4,830,000 is attributable to the increase in the trademark application fee. The enacted
1994 budget is $504,021,000. An additional $14,671,000 of patent statutory fees will be collected in 1994 and will
be deposited to the Fee Surcharge Fund.
Patent statutory fees are subject to the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended by
Public Law 102-204. Of the total amount of income expected to be collected in 1994 under 35 U.S.C. 41 (a) and (b),
$103,000,000 must be deposited to the Fee Surcharge Fund for deficit reduction purposes in lieu of seeking general
taxpayer funds from the U.S. Treasury. The $103,000,000 is deposited in a special account in the U.S. Treasury, reserved
exclusively for use by the PTO, and is made available to the PTO through the appropriation process. For 1994, the Congress
appropriated $88,329,000 from the Fee Surcharge Fund.


General Procedures


There will be a grace period of 60 days, beginning December 3, 1993, and ending January 31, 1994. During the grace period,
any party who submits a trademark application, which is otherwise sufficient, with a fee of at least $210, but less
than $245, will be notified of the fee deficiency and permitted to supplement it within a 30-day period set by the notice
of the insufficient fee. If the applicant submits the amount by which the fee is deficient within the 30-day period,
the application will retain its original filing date. If the amount by which the fee is deficient is not submitted within
30 days, the application papers and fee will be returned to the applicant. Any trademark application submitted after
January 31, 1994 with a deficient fee payment will be returned to the applicant.


Discussion of Specific Rules


37 CFR 2.6 Trademark fees


Section 2.6, subparagraph (a)(1), is revised to adjust the fee authorized by the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946 in
accordance with the provisions of Public Law 103-179.


Other Considerations


This rule change is in conformity with the requirements of Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq. 

There are no information collection requirements relating to patent and trademark fee rules.
This regulation was reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget
under Executive Order 12866.
The PTO has determined that this rule change has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the
National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.
Notice and opportunity for comment are unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(6)(b) because this rule change merely restates
a Congressionally-mandated fee change. Because notice of proposed rulemaking is not required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) does not apply.
The PTO published a notice of proposed rulemaking on July 21, 1993, (58 FR 39102) to increase the trademark fee to $245
based on pending legislation that would have given PTO the authority to raise trademark fees in excess of the Consumer
Price Index. The legislation as passed (Pub. L. 103-179) simply increased the trademark application filing
fee to $245 effective the date of enactment.

Summer Flounder Fishery



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of commercial quota transfer and commercial quota availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS issues this notification to announce that 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of summer flounder commercial quota available
to the State of North Carolina has been transferred to the State of Rhode Island. This transfer adjusts the commercial
quota for the State of North Carolina to 3,121,750 pounds (1,416,016 kg) and adjusts the Rhode Island quota to 1,946,851
pounds (883,086 kg). As a result of this transfer, NMFS announces that vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for
the summer flounder fishery may resume landing summer flounder in the State of Rhode Island until further notice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP) are found at 50 CFR part
625 (December 4, 1992, 57 FR 57358). The regulations require an annual specification of a commercial quota that is
apportioned among the coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial
quota and the percent allocated to each state are described in  625.20.




The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1993 calendar year is set equal to 12.35 million pounds (5.6 million
kg) (January 22, 1993, 58 FR 5658). The percent allocated to each state was adjusted by Amendment 4 to the FMP (September
24, 1993, 58 FR 49937) with 15.68298 percent or 1,936,851 pounds (878,550 kg) allocated to Rhode Island, and 27.44584
percent, or 3,389,565 pounds (1,537,497 kg) allocated to North Carolina.

An emergency interim rule published August 26, 1993, (58 FR 45075), and extended on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62556),
allows two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS,
(Regional Director), to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required
to consider the criteria set forth in  625.20 in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations.

The 1993 coastwide commercial quota apportioned to North Carolina effective on January 1, 1993 (58 FR 5658; January
22, 1993), in the amount of 3,435,214 pounds (1.56 million kg) was revised by Amendment 4 to the FMP effective October
25, 1993 (58 FR 49937), reducing the amount by 45,649 pounds (20,706 kg) totalling 3,389,565 pounds (1.54 million
kg). North Carolina made three transfers during 1993 totalling 257,815 pounds (116,942 kg) of summer flounder, reducing
the amount to 3,131,750 pounds (1.42 million kg). Two transfers were made to Virginia for 125,000 pounds (56,699 kg)
each; one was effective on November 3, 1993 (58 FR 59196; November 8, 1993), and the other was effective on November
19, 1993 (58 FR 62050). The third transfer was made to New Jersey in the amount of 7,815 pounds (3,545 kg) and was effective
on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 61844; November 23, 1993).
Further, the Regional Director is required to publish a notification in the 

Federal Register 

advising a state, and notifying Federal vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a specific date, a portion
of a state's commercial quota has been transferred to, or combined with, the commercial quota of another state.
North Carolina and Rhode Island have agreed to transfer 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of North Carolina's commercial quota
to Rhode Island. The Regional Director has determined that the criteria set forth in  625.20 have been met, and
publishes this notification of quota transfer. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1993 are: North Carolina_3,121,750
pounds (1,416,016 kg); Rhode Island_1,946,851 pounds (883,086 kg).
As a result of this quota transfer, the previous notice of closure effective December 22, 1993, is rescinded and vessels
may again land summer flounder in Rhode Island until the available 1993 quota is harvested.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Trip limit reduction.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS reduces the commercial trip limit in the Florida west coast zone to 50 king mackerel per day in or from the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ). This trip limit reduction is necessary to protect the overfished Gulf king mackerel resource.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin,
and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic
Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic
Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642, under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.


Catch limits recommended by the Councils and implemented by NMFS for the Gulf of Mexico migratory group of king mackerel
for the current fishing year (July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, 58 FR 58509, November 2, 1993) set the commercial
quota of king mackerel in the Florida west coast zone at 865,000 pounds (392,361 kg). In accordance with 50 CFR 642.31(a)(2),
from the date that 75 percent of the zone's commercial quota has been harvested until a closure of the Florida west coast
zone has been effected, king mackerel in or from the EEZ may be possessed aboard or landed from a permitted vessel in
amounts not exceeding 50 per day. Such 50-fish trip limit remains in effect through June 30, 1994, the end of the fishing
year, unless 100 percent of the commercial quota is reached before June 30, in which case the commercial fishery for
king mackerel in the Florida west coast zone is closed by publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

.

NMFS has determined that 75 percent of the commercial quota for Gulf group king mackerel from the Florida west coast
zone was reached on December 28, 1993. Accordingly, a 50-fish trip limit applies to king mackerel in or from the EEZ
in the Florida west coast zone effective 12:01 p.m., local time, December 29, 1993.
The Florida west coast zone extends from the Alabama/Florida boundary (87
 31
'06
'
'W. longitude) to: (1) the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary (25
 20.4
'N. latitude) from November 1 through March 31; and (2) the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary (25
 48
'N. latitude) from April 1 through October 31.

Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; suspension of effectiveness.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 16, 1992, NMFS promulgated regulations, effective January 1, 1993, establishing a license-limitation-limited-entry
system for the Pacific Coast commercial groundfish fishery. The regulations, among other things, require that an
owner of a vessel wishing to participate in the limited-entry fishery have a Federally issued limited-entry permit
endorsed with an appropriate vessel size endorsement. In view of a delay in issuing certain other regulations necessary
to fully implement this system, this action suspends until April 1, 1994, the effectiveness of the vessel size endorsement
requirement, which limits variances in vessel length from the length specified in a permit. The intent of this action
is to allow vessel owners to participate in the limited-entry fishery who would otherwise be barred from the fishery
by the size endorsement requirement.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 16, 1992, NMFS promulgated regulations codified at 50 CFR 663.30-663.43, and effective January
1, 1993, establishing a license-limitation-limited-entry system for the Pacific Coast commercial groundfish
fishery. The regulations, among other things, require that an owner of a vessel wishing to participate in the limited-entry
fishery, have a Federally issued limited-entry permit endorsed with an appropriate vessel size endorsement.


In general, each limited-entry permit is endorsed with the overall length of the vessel with which it initially qualified
for a permit. Under 50 CFR 663.33(f)(2), a limited-entry permit endorsed for gear other than trawl gear may be registered
for use with a vessel up to 5 feet (1.52 m) longer than, the same length as, or any length shorter than, the size endorsed
on the existing permit. A limited-entry permit endorsed for trawl gear may be registered for use with a vessel between
5 feet (1.52 m) shorter, and 5 feet (1.52 m) longer, than the size endorsed on the existing permit.
Where the owner would like to use a limited entry permit with a vessel of a length that exceeds the variance,  663.33(g)
allows the owner to combine two or more limited-entry permits from smaller vessels, in order to ``step-up'' to a permit
for the larger vessel. However, before any permits may be combined,  663.33(g) also requires the Director,
Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), with the professional advice of marine architects and other qualified
individuals, and after consultation with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), to develop and implement,
through amendment of the regulations, a standardized measure of harvest capacity for the purpose of determining
the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited-entry permits created by combining two or more permits with smaller
size endorsements.

<TEXT>
 

While the Regional Director has completed the process of consultation with the appropriate persons and the Council,
and has developed regulations to implement the required standardized measure of harvest capacity and associated
rules for combining permits, the regulations have not yet been proposed. However, this proposal will soon be published
in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment, and a final rule is expected to be published and to be effective by April 1, 1994.

In anticipation of issuance by January 1, 1994, of the regulations governing the combining of permits, some vessel
owners have acquired larger vessels and additional limited-entry permits. NMFS estimates that by January 1, 1994,
30 or more vessel owners will have limited entry permits endorsed with the size  of  a qualifying vessel that has been
replaced by a vessel more than 5 feet (1.52m) longer than the qualifying vessel. Under  663.33(f)(2), none of
these vessel owners could participate in the fishery until he/she obtains a single permit endorsed with the size of
the larger vessel.

In order to allow limited-entry permit holders in the situation just described to participate in the limited-entry
fishery until the date by which the Regional Director is expected to have issued the necessary final rule, NMFS is suspending,
until April 1, 1994, the effectiveness of 663.33(f)(2)_the provision of the regulations imposing limitations of
endorsed length on the use of limited-entry permits.

Failure to take this action would result in limited-entry permit owners who have already obtained, or are in the process
of obtaining, additional limited entry permits for combination into a larger permit being unable to participate
in the limited-entry fishery until the Regional Director issues the necessary final rule. The limited-entry program
is not intended to prevent permit owners from participating in a fishery for which they have obtained the appropriate
limited-entry permits.

NMFS does not expect this suspension will result in much, if any, additional harvest capacity entering the limited-entry
fishery during the time of the suspension. The harvest of all major species taken in the limited-entry fishery during
the first 3 months of the calendar year is controlled with restrictive trip limits that serve as a disincentive to any
permit holders bringing new, large-capacity fishing vessels into the fishery.



Classification



This final rule is issued under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq. 

Because this rule must be in effect at the time limited-entry permits are required for participation in the limited-entry
fishery (January 1, 1994) in order to allow vessel owners who intend to combine permits to participate in the limited-entry
fishery pending establishment of a system to combine permits, it is unnecessary and not in the public interest to provide
prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Also, because this rule temporarily relieves a restriction, it is
being made effective immediately without a 30-day delay in effectiveness under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing this final rule to establish July 1, 1995, as the date on which
it will apply the mandatory nutrition labeling and nutrient content claims provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the act) to dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances
(hereinafter referred to as dietary supplements). This action is in accordance with the Dietary Supplement Act of
1992 (the DS act) and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments), which allows the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) (and, by delegation, FDA) to delay, for up to 1 year, the date on which FDA
applies those provisions to foods (including dietary supplements) if the agency finds that compliance with them
would cause ``undue economic hardship.''


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




I. Background


On November 8, 1990, President Bush signed into law the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101-535). This statute adds
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) among other sections, section 403(q) (21 U.S.C. 343(q)), which
makes nutrition labeling mandatory for most foods, and section 403(r)(2) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)), which gives FDA
authority to define nutrient content claims. 
In accordance with the 1990 amendments, FDA published proposed rules on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 

et seq

.), and final rules on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2066 

et seq

.) implementing, among other things, the sections of the act on mandatory nutrition labeling and nutrient content
claims, among other things, for foods in conventional food form. Because of the DS act, the final regulations did not
include provisions on the nutrition labeling of, or nutrient content claims for, dietary supplements. 
The DS act (Pub. L. 102-571) was signed into law on October 6, 1992. In section 202(a)(1), the DS act established
a moratorium until December 15, 1993, on the implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements
that are not in the form of conventional food. Section 202(a)(2) of the DS act required the Secretary (and, by delegation,
FDA) to issue new proposed regulations that are applicable to dietary supplements no later than June 15, 1993, and
final regulations by December 31, 1993. On June 18, 1993, FDA issued proposed regulations in response to this provision
of the DS act (58 FR 33700 

et seq

.). Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is issuing the final rules.
Under section 10(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the 1990 amendments (21 U.S.C. 343 note), section 403(q) and (r)(2) of the act
are effective 6 months after the promulgation of final regulations or after the date that proposed regulations are
considered to be final regulations. Thus, because the final regulations on the nutrition labeling of, and nutrient
content claims for, dietary supplements are being issued on January 4, 1994, section 403(q) and 403(r)(2) will be
effective with respect to dietary supplements July 5, 1994. However, section 10(a)(3)(B) of the 1990 amendments
provides that if the Secretary and, by delegation, FDA      `` * * * finds that compliance
with sections 403(q) and 403(r)(2) of such Act would cause an undue economic hardship, the Secretary may delay the
application of such sections for no more than one year.'' 
FDA found such ``undue economic hardship'' existed for the conventional food industry in a final rule published on
January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2070), entitled ``Food Labeling: Establishment of Date of Application'' (hereinafter called
the date of application final rule). In that document, FDA delayed the application of section 403(q) and (r)(2) for
1 year, until May 8, 1994.
In the proposed rules on nutrition labeling (58 FR 33715 at 33725) and nutrient content claims (58 FR 33731 at 33748)
for dietary supplements, FDA asked for comment on whether a similar delay in application of section 403(q) and (r)(2)
would be appropriate for dietary supplements. The agency gave interested persons until August 17, 1993, to comment
on whether the 6-month proposed compliance date would cause ``undue economic hardship.'' FDA received approximately
2,000 letters of which approximately one-third contain one or more comments concerning either the date of application
or other economic issues from consumers, consumer advocacy organizations, health care professionals, professional
societies, universities, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, trade associations, and State governments.
A discussion of the agency's decision, and a summary of the comments, concerning the delay of the date of application
and other economic issues and the agency responses follow. 


II. Undue Economic Hardship


A. Comments


Several comments requested that FDA extend the date that the nutrition labeling and nutrient content claim provisions
of the act will be applied to dietary supplements. Most comments requested an additional year, for a total compliance
period of 18 months. One comment proposed a delay of at least 9 months. The comments reported many examples of the difficulties
in meeting a 6-month compliance period. Several comments stated that the amount of time needed to redesign labels
would far exceed the resources available. One comment reported that the insufficient time allowed to revise labels
would result in some products being removed from the market temporarily while new labels are being prepared. An additional
comment requested the extension because of the difficulties in the logistics of revising existing labels, printing,
packaging, and exhausting existing label supplies with a short compliance period. 
Other comments that requested a delay cited the savings that could be gained with insignificant loss of benefits.
One comment reported that inventory disposal could be reduced by 85 percent with an 18-month compliance period. Another
comment stated that FDA's cost estimate of $20 million represents 1 percent of industry sales but a much larger percentage
of industry profits. The comment explained that extending the compliance period would reduce the costs of compliance
and, therefore, minimize any reduction in profits. 
One comment requested a delay because there will be additional costs for compliance with the upcoming United States
Pharmacopoeia (USP) standards. The comment stated that resources could be better spent if these compliance efforts
were completed concurrently rather than consecutively.
One comment requested a delay because of the overlap with the final months of the extended period that was allowed for
foods in conventional food form. The comment reported that many conventional food manufacturers and their label
suppliers are rushing to produce final labels for such foods. The comment said that supplement manufacturers will
not be able to secure revised labels for their products from label manufacturers in time to meet a 6-month deadline
because of the competition for label manufacturers' resources. 
The agency agrees that it will be difficult for dietary supplement manufacturers to comply within 6 months, especially
in light of the fact that label suppliers are currently stressed with label orders from manufacturers of food in conventional
food form who are attempting to meet the May 1994 deadline for complying with the 1990 amendments. The agency also agrees
that an extension of the date of application would result in significant savings for the industry. Administrative
costs, printing costs, and label inventory disposal costs are all dependent on the length of the compliance period.
The agency has determined that the costs of the regulations could be reduced with an extension. 
The agency made a determination in the date of application final rule that the 1990 amendments will result in an undue
economic hardship on manufacturers of food products in conventional food form (58 FR 2070 at 2075). The agency notes
that the costs of compliance for manufacturers of foods in conventional food form represent less than 1 percent of
sales. The costs of compliance with a 6-month compliance period for dietary supplements is approximately 2 percent
of sales. Therefore, if the agency does not extend the date of application for dietary supplement manufacturers,
that segment of the food industry will be asked to bear higher relative costs than the agency determined were reasonable
for foods in conventional food form.
For all these reasons, the agency determines that the congressionally mandated date of application will result in
an undue economic hardship for dietary supplement manufacturers. 


B. The Agency's Determination of a Date of Application of Section 403(q) and (r)(2) of the Act as Applied to Dietary
Supplements 


The agency has determined that undue economic hardship will result if the dietary supplement industry is required
to comply with section 403(q) and (r) of the act within 6 months. As will be shown in the following discussion on the economic
impact, a 6-month delay (total of 12 months to comply) in the application of section 403(q) and (r)(2) to dietary supplements
would result in over 40 percent savings of compliance cost, and a 12-month delay (total of 18 months to comply) would
result in over 50 percent savings. Given the large disparity in costs of compliance for manufacturers of dietary supplements
if they are required to comply in 6 months, as compared to those that are being borne by manufacturers of food in conventional
form, FDA finds that it should tailor the delay to reduce the costs for dietary supplement manufacturers and thus to
minimize the disparity. Therefore, the agency concludes that it is appropriate to delay the application date for
dietary supplements for 12 months, as it did for foods in conventional food form. Thus, the agency intends to apply
section 403(q) and (r)(2) to foods labeled after July 1, 1995. The agency fully expects that some dietary supplement
firms will be able to comply before this date once the pressure on printing labels for foods in conventional food form
is eased after May 8, 1994. Therefore, consumers can expect to begin enjoying the health benefits of the label changes
prior to July 1, 1995. 


III. Economic Impact


Some comments agreed with the agency's estimates of the costs of relabeling. Many comments were directed at issues
covered by the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), which addressed the safe use of dietary supplements
(58 FR 33690, June 18, 1993). Several comments stated that the three proposals that the agency issued (there was a proposed
rule on health claims (58 FR 33700 in addition to the proposals on nutrition labeling and nutrient content claims))
and the ANPRM should be considered one proposal. These comments stated that the economic impact of the four documents
would exceed $100 million and would be considered a major rule under Executive Order 12291. 
The agency disagrees. Executive Order 12291 did not apply to advance notices. Therefore, no analysis of that document
was required by that Executive Order. (FDA has not taken any action with respect to the ANPRM that would make it subject
to Executive Order 12866). The three proposals are concerned with the labeling of dietary supplements, while the
ANPRM is concerned with other issues. Thus, the costs and benefits associated with regulatory alternatives described
in the ANPRM can be separated from those resulting from the three proposals on labeling actions. The agency has evaluated
the labeling actions together, however, because it is not possible to separate the impacts of the various labeling
actions. Finally, FDA is taking no further action with respect to the ANPRM at this time. 


A. Scope


1. Several comments objected to the agency's estimate of the number of products that will be affected by the nutrition
labeling and nutrient content claims rulemakings. Two comments stated that there are 25,000 products that are potentially
affected by the rules, rather than the agency's estimate of 5,000 products. Another comment stated that there are
approximately 25,000 herbal products alone that would be required to be tested and relabeled. Another comment objected
to the agency's estimate because the agency failed to include amino acids, herbal products, and other dietary supplements
that have no recognizable food function. 
In its analysis of the proposals, FDA stated that there could be as many as 25,000 products that could be considered
to be dietary supplements. The agency reduced that number to 5,000, an estimate of the number of vitamin and mineral
supplement products, because: (1) Many products that contain herbs or other similar nutritional substances would
not be subject to the nutrition label requirements because they do not contain the nutrients that must be declared,
and (2) some products marketed as dietary supplements would be unaffected by the 1990 amendments because they bear
drug claims that make them subject to the drug provisions of the act. For these reasons, it is clear that not all 25,000
products would be required to be tested or relabeled in response to the regulations implementing the 1990 amendments.

However, FDA is convinced by the comments that some herbal products and other dietary supplements might need to be
tested and relabeled as a result of these regulations. FDA is unable to determine exactly how many of those products
would be covered by the food provisions of the act rather than by the drug provisions. Therefore, the agency's final
analysis of the rules is based on a range of products between 5,000 and 25,000.
2. Several comments objected to the agency's estimate that approximately 150 firms will be affected by the regulations.
Some comments stated that approximately 500 firms would be affected by the proposed rules if made final. Another comment
stated that 250 herb manufacturers and 150 manufacturers of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals would be
affected. Another comment objected to the agency's source for the number of firms. The comment explained that Dunn
and Bradstreet's Electronic Yellow Pages is primarily a listing for public companies, and the majority of supplement
manufacturers are privately-held corporations. The comment suggested that conservative estimates suggest that
there are a minimum of 150 herb companies alone.
The agency has confirmed that the Electronic Yellow Pages covers both public and private organizations of all types
and sizes. The agency admits that the Electronic Yellow Pages is not a perfect source for the number of firms, but FDA
believes that it is not entirely inadequate. The major difference between the agency's estimate and those of the comments
is the inclusion or exclusion of manufacturers herbal products and products containing other similar nutritional
substances. As stated in the response to the previous comment, the agency has determined that at least some of these
types of dietary supplement products may be subject to the nutrition labeling provisions. However, because many
of these products do not contain significant amounts of nutrients, many manufacturers will not be faced with the necessity
of relabeling their products. For these reasons, the agency believes that its estimate of the number of firms may be
low, but that to include all herbal products manufacturers and manufacturers of other similar nutritional substances
would inflate the estimate. However, the agency has no basis on which to arrive at the actual number of firms. Therefore,
in its final analysis, the agency is estimating the total number of firms affected to be between 150 and 300.


B. Costs


3. Several comments disagreed with the agency's estimate of administrative costs. The comments stated that actual
administrative expenses would be at least $1,000 per label. Administrative expenses, according to the comments,
are associated with the creation or redesign, proofreading, legal review, pricing, bid review, and retraining of
customer service and sales staff. One comment estimates that administrative costs to one firm would be 80 to 120 hours
of executive time, or approximately $2,500 to $3,750.
FDA recognizes that the factors that determine administrative costs are very complicated. The agency's estimates
of administrative costs are based on a compliance cost model for food labeling created for FDA by Research Triangle
Institute (RTI) (Ref. 1). According to RTI, many firms estimate that administrative effort would be twice as high
for a 6-month compliance period as for a 12-month compliance period. In the dietary supplement proposals, FDA estimated
that for a 6-month compliance period, manufacturers of dietary supplements will incur administrative costs of $850
per firm. The range of administrative cost estimates submitted in the comments was broad and there were no identifiable
patterns to the estimates given. Although FDA acknowledges that its assumptions may have resulted in underestimates,
the comments did not provide enough detailed information to permit FDA to evaluate the administrative cost estimates
that they submitted. Therefore, the agency is not altering its original estimates based on these comments.
The agency has determined that total administrative costs for a 6-month compliance period are between $130,000 and
$250,000, depending on the exact number of firms affected by the regulations. As determined by the contractor's study
(Ref. 1), administrative costs are lower with longer compliance periods. A 1-year compliance period results in administrative
costs of between $65,000 and $125,000. An 18-month compliance period results in administrative costs of between
$50,000 and $94,000. 
4. One comment stated that the requirement that herbal dietary supplements be required to bear nutrition labeling
would mandate that all herbal products be assayed for their nutrient content. The comment further explained that
testing for 12 nutrients would cost $588 per product for a total of $15 million for 25,000 products. 
The agency agrees that to the extent that herbal product manufacturers will provide nutrition labeling, herbal products
will need to be assayed for their nutrient content. The agency notes, however, that many herbs do not contain significant
amounts of the nutrients that must be listed in the nutrition label, and that this fact is determinable from reference
works without testing. Thus, these herbs will not need to be tested. Many comments admitted that, in general, herbal
products do not contain significant amounts of nutrients and are not consumed for their nutrient content. However,
some herbal products and combination products will require nutrient testing.
In the proposals, the agency assumed that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals will not undergo any additional
testing as a result of the nutrition labeling requirements. Comments did not object to this assumption.
Therefore, in its final analysis, the agency is estimating that as many as 20,000 products may undergo testing once
every 5 years for a total discounted analytical cost over the next 20 years of $33 million (7 percent discount rate).
5. One comment agreed, and several comments disagreed, with the agency's estimate of label printing and redesign
costs. The comments that disagreed stated that printing and redesign costs would be at least $800 to $1,200 per label.
One comment stated that the cost of redesigning and printing each label would be 2 hours of desktop redesign, $20 for
linotronic service, and $600 for new plates, for a total of $750 per label.
One comment objected to FDA's assumption that label revisions for supplements are less comprehensive than revisions
for foods in conventional food form. The comment states that incorporating the ``Nutrition Facts'' section plus
the ingredient list will necessitate complete redistribution of information on many labels.
In the analysis of the proposed rules, the agency estimated that, for a 6-month compliance period, printing and redesign
costs would be approximately $1,000 per label. The comments do not suggest that the agency's estimate is incorrect.
Therefore, the agency's final analysis of printing costs is based on a per label cost of $1,000 for each of between 15,000
and 75,000 labels, or between $15 million and $75 million. According to the RTI study, the length of the compliance
period determines a firm's ability to combine planned label changes with mandated changes. Therefore, incremental
labeling and redesign activities are less costly with lengthier compliance periods. If the agency extended the compliance
period by only 6 months, printing and redesign costs would be between $7.5 million and $37.5 million. The 1-year extension
that the agency is providing will reduce printing and redesign costs to between $6 million and $28 million.
6. Several comments provided data on label inventories that would be subject to disposal. These comments stated that
a 4- to 6-month supply of product labels is common, resulting in $3.4 million to $5.1 million of label inventory that
will be discarded. Another comment suggested that its dietary supplement label and box inventory disposal costs
would be $325,000 with a 6-month compliance period, $200,000 with a 1-year compliance period, and $50,000 with an
18-month compliance period. One comment estimated the cost of discarding noncompliant labels would be approximately
$30,000 for one firm. 
The estimates provided by the comments are in line with the agency's preliminary estimate of label inventory disposal
costs. Therefore, the agency is not changing its estimate based on the comments. The cost of label inventory disposal
for a 6-month compliance period is between $5 million and $25 million, depending on the number of products affected.
According to the RTI study and comments, lengthier compliance periods allow firms to use up more existing label supplies,
thus reducing inventory disposal costs. According to data submitted in response to the Regulatory Impact Analysis
document that was published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366), and adjusted to reflect the range of products affected, if the agency had extended
the compliance period for an additional 6 months, inventory disposal costs would be between $3 million and $13 million.
The 18-month compliance period that the agency is providing will result in costs of between $2 million and $9 million.
7. Several comments disagreed with the agency's estimate of the cost of inventory disposal. The comments argued that
firms would dispose of finished product in addition to labels. The comments stated that typical product costs for
dietary supplements would result in an inventory value for the disposal of 5,000 products of between $48 million and
$73 million. One firm estimated its own cost of discarding noncompliant inventory would be approximately 30 percent
of finished goods inventory, or about $45,000.
Because these proposals cover only the labeling of dietary supplements, the agency does not agree that there would
be any reason for firms to dispose of any product inventory. Nor did the comments provide an explanation as to why it
would be necessary to do so. Moreover, any product packaged and labeled in accordance with law before the date that
FDA begins to apply the section 403(q) and (r) of the act will not need to be relabeled. Therefore, the agency is not changing
its estimate based on this comment.
8. Several comments argued that the agency failed to consider the cost of discarding and redesigning catalogs, product
literature, and advertising. The comments suggested that these costs would be at least $40,000 per firm, or $20 million
for all firms.
The comments did not provide an explanation as to why it would be necessary to discard and redesign catalogs and product
literature. The agency does agree that, to the extent that these materials are labeling, they must comply with the
nutrient content and health claims provisions of the act. However, the agency believes that many of the claims made
in these types of materials are drug claims or structure-function claims, not health claims, and therefore are not
subject to these rules. The comments did not present evidence to support a different finding. Consequently, the agency
has no basis on which to conclude that extensive catalog and product literature redesign will be required by these
final rules. Therefore, the agency is not changing its estimate based on these comments.
9. Several comments argued that the agency failed to consider the cost of relabeling of product returned from the retailer.
The comments stated that it is common practice in the supplement industry to accept returns from retailers in the event
of a label change. Industry firms would be faced with a number of products returned from retailers unwilling to carry
products with older labels. The comments estimated the cost of processing returns, disposing of product, and applying
for full credit at $48 million.
Any product labeled before the applicability date will not need to comply with the new nutrition labeling and nutrient
content claim provisions. Therefore, no product that is labeled in accordance with law before July 1, 1995, need be
returned, relabeled, or destroyed as a result of these new provisions. However, FDA agrees that to the extent that
product is returned, the cost of disposing of product returned from retailers because of ``old'' labeling should
be considered a cost of these regulations. However, the agency is unpersuaded of the magnitude of the cost and is unsure
of the extent to which ``old'' product will be returned. The comments provided insufficient information with which
the agency could estimate these costs. Therefore, the agency is not changing its estimates based on this comment.
10. Several comments expressed concern that the rules may cause the loss of many thousands of jobs, the closing of many
firms, and the loss of products from the marketplace. According to one comment, the proposed rules would cause the
loss of more than $10 million in sales and as many as 100 jobs in one company. Another comment stated a belief that 2 million
Americans will lose their jobs as a result of the regulations. The comments did not provide any specific information
as to how the regulations would cause the loss of jobs and products.
The agency agrees that the inability to make certain nutrient content or health claims may reduce the marketability
of certain products and perhaps lead to a company's decision to remove a product from the marketplace. However, these
rules affect only labeling; they do not require any supplement to be removed from the market. Moreover, the agency
does not believe that many products are currently making health claims, as distinguished from drug claims or structure-function
claims. Therefore, the agency has no basis to find that these regulations will cause the problems described in these
comments. The agency believes that there is every reason to expect that the continued marketing of the vast majority
of dietary supplement products will be unaffected by these regulations.
11. In the analysis of the proposed rules, the agency recognized that the rules could have an adverse impact on small
businesses. Most of the costs associated with labeling regulations are fixed costs, which are typically more burdensome
for small firms than for large firms because of the smaller sales base on which to spread costs.
One comment stated that the small business exemption was inadequate because small firms would not be able to avoid
complying with the regulations because of competitive pressure. Another comment stated that the proposals would
be catastrophic to small business owners and workers. 
FDA notes that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act Amendments of 1993, which were enacted on August 13, 1993,
provide relief for small businesses from the requirements of section 403(q) of the act. The agency believes that the
new exemption for small businesses will significantly mitigate any negative impact on small firms.
12. One comment stated that the proposed rule regarding health claims will cause pain, suffering, and death that would
not occur were labeling and advertising allowed to include health claims. The comment was unspecific as to why these
results would occur.
If the absence of health claims causes pain, suffering, or death, these regulations provide any party with a vehicle
for submitting data to support a particular health claim for agency review. Therefore, the agency does not agree with
this comment.


C. Benefits


13. One comment stated that the regulations will provide benefits by preventing consumers from wasting money on unnecessary
and ineffective dietary supplements. Another comment stated that if someone wanted to waste a little money taking
too many vitamins or supplements in the hope of avoiding serious illness and the need for harsh drugs, they should be
allowed to do so.
Because there are sources other than labeling that provide information about the potential uses of dietary supplements,
the agency believes that limiting the use of claims on labels or labeling will be of limited effect in preventing consumers
from purchasing supplements that they erroneously believe will prevent serious illness. However, these regulations
will ensure that the labels of dietary supplements will provide full nutrition labeling to help consumers to maintain
healthy dietary practices, and they will help to ensure that any nutrient content or health claims made in the labeling
of these products are scientifically valid, truthful, and not misleading. For these reasons, these regulations
will provide a significant benefit.
14. Some comments stated that the cost of providing nutrition information on the labels of dietary supplements of
herbs would greatly outweigh any clear public benefit. The comments explained that herbs do not contain significant
amounts of the core nutrients and are not normally consumed for their nutritional value. Therefore, the value to consumers
of including nutrition labeling on herb products is insignificant.
The agency agrees with this comment. However, the agency notes that those products that do not contain significant
amounts of the 14 mandatory nutrients will generally not be required to bear nutrition labeling. Therefore, although
there will be no clear public benefit, there will also be no cost.


D. Summary of the Economic Impact


FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules amending on nutrition labeling, nutrient content claims,
and health claims for dietary supplements as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory
Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. FDA finds that these final
rules on dietary supplements, taken together, are not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866. In accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rules will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small businesses.
The agency has reviewed the comments and has determined that the costs of compliance associated with the 18-month
compliance period provided by the agency include administrative costs of between $50,000 and $100,000, analytical
costs of between $0 and $33 million, printing and redesign costs of between $6 and $28 million, and label inventory
disposal costs of between $2 and $9 million. Total discounted costs of the final regulations, taken together are between
$8 and $60 million (7 percent discount rate). If the agency did not extend the application of the rules, total discounted
costs would be between $20 and $133 million for a 6-month compliance period, or between $11 and $84 million for a 1-year
compliance period. 


IV. Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24 (a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement is required.



V. Reference


The following reference has been placed on display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and may be seen

VI. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, FDA hereby establishes July 1, 1995, as the date on which it will apply the mandatory nutrition
labeling and nutrient content claims provisions of the act to dietary supplements.

Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition Labeling for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs,
or Other Similar Nutritional Substances


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its food labeling regulations to establish requirements for the
nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances
(hereinafter referred to as dietary supplements). This action is in response to certain provisions of the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33715), FDA published a proposed rule entitled ``Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition
Labeling for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, or Other Similar Nutritional Substances'' (hereinafter
identified as ``the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements'') to establish regulations on the nutrition
labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances. A document
correcting various editorial errors in that proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40104). 
The proposed rule was issued to implement the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101-535), which were signed into law on November
8, 1990. This new law amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One of
the notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that it added section 403(q) to the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)). This section
requires that most foods bear nutrition labeling. 
In response to section 403(q) of the act, FDA published a proposed rule on nutrition labeling in the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60393). That document proposed, among other things, a regulation specifically
for the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals (proposed  101.36). It also proposed
to make the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of herbs or other similar nutritional substances subject to
 101.9 (21 CFR 101.9), the general regulation on nutrition labeling. This distinction reflects section 403(q)(5)(F)
(formerly section 403(q)(5)(E)) of the act. This section provides that if a food to which section 411 of the act (21
U.S.C. 350) applies (i.e., a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals) contains one or more of the nutrients required
to be listed in nutrition labeling, ``the label or labeling of such food shall comply with requirements of subparagraph
(1) and (2) [of section 403(q) of the act] in a manner which is appropriate for such food and which is specified in regulations
of the Secretary.'' Other dietary supplements are not subject to section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act and thus are subject
to regulation under section 403(q) of the act as any other food.
In response to the proposed rule on nutrition labeling of November 27, 1991, FDA received over 45 responses, each containing
one or more comments, that pertained to the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements. The agency summarized and
discussed the issues in these comments in the preamble of the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule that it issued
on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2079 at 2167). However, the regulations that FDA adopted in that final rule applied only to
the nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form ( 101.9). They did not apply to dietary supplements
because of a moratorium established by the DS act. 
The DS act (Pub. L. 102-571) was signed into law on October 6, 1992. In section 202(a)(1), the DS act established
a moratorium until December 15, 1993, on the implementation of the 1990 amendments, with respect to dietary supplements.
Thus, FDA did not finalize the proposed rules pertaining to the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals ( 101.36) or of herbs or other nutritional substances.
Section 202(a)(2) of the DS act required that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and by delegation FDA, issue
new proposed regulations that are applicable to dietary supplements no later than June 15, 1993, and final regulations
by December 31, 1993. In response to this provision, FDA issued the June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33715) proposal and is now issuing
this final rule. In addition, elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is issuing final regulations that address the use of nutrient content claims and health claims on dietary supplements.

In addition, section 203 of the DS act instructed FDA not to promulgate regulations before November 8, 1993, that establish
recommended daily allowances for vitamins or minerals other than those recommended allowances specified in  101.9(c)(7)(iv)
as in effect on October 6, 1992. Therefore, in the January 6, 1993, mandatory nutrition labeling final rule, FDA retained
the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances (U.S. RDA) values specified in  101.9(c)(7)(iv), as in effect on October
6, 1992. These U.S. RDA values were in large measure based on the RDA's in the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) publication
``Recommended Dietary Allowances,'' 7th edition, 1968 (Ref. 1). The agency did, however, change the terminology
for these values from ``U.S. RDA's'' to ``Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's).''
FDA received over 400 responses to its June 18, 1993, proposed rule on the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements,
each of these responses contained one or more comments. Responses were received from consumers, consumer advocacy
organizations, health care professionals, professional societies, universities, industry, trade associations,
and State and local governments. Many comments addressed issues covered by other proposals that are a part of this
overall food labeling initiative, and they will be addressed in those documents. Other comments were outside the
scope of these proposals and will not be discussed here. 
About half of the comments supported the proposal; about half of these comments supported it without modification.
These comments were primarily from health professionals, although a few were from that segment of the food industry
that produces foods in conventional food form. The remainder of the comments that supported the proposal suggested
modifications in various provisions of the proposal. About half of the comments opposed the proposal. These comments
were primarily from consumers who opposed FDA's regulation of dietary supplements. A summary of the comments that
suggested changes and the agency's responses follow:
 

II. Scope of New  101.36


1. One comment from a manufacturer of dietary supplements supported the proposed rule to allow only vitamins and minerals
that have RDI's or Daily Reference Values (DRV's) to be listed in the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals. However, several comments wanted non-RDI vitamins and minerals to be listed, particularly those in
the NAS's ``Recommended Dietary Allowances'' (i.e., chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,
and vitamin K). The comments pointed out that advances in scientific knowledge have shown that these nutrients are
considered essential to human health. Some comments also suggested listing nutrients such as arsenic, boron, silicon,
tin, and vanadium that they stated are of major significance in human nutrition. 
Some of these comments suggested that an asterisk in the ``Percent Daily Value'' column could refer to a footnote,
such as ``No Daily Value has been established for this nutrient.'' Another comment suggested that these additional
nutrients could be listed in a subsection of the nutrition panel below the bar after the last nutrient for which there
is an RDI or DRV. One comment stated that to put information on nutrients of this type outside of the ``Nutrition Facts''
box would be inconvenient and may cause some consumers to overlook the presence of these additional nutrients, some
of which should not be consumed in excess.
 The agency is persuaded that it is appropriate to allow the nutrients that are listed as being essential to humans in
the NAS's ``Recommended Dietary Allowances'' (Refs. 2 and 10), but for which FDA has not established RDI's, to be declared
in the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when they are present in supplements at more
than insignificant amounts. The agency agrees that there have been significant advances in scientific knowledge
with respect to essential nutrient requirements since 1968. In 1989, the NAS updated its RDA's to include values for
vitamin K and selenium and to make significant revisions in the allowances for several nutrients including vitamin
B6, folate (folic acid), vitamin B12, magnesium, iron and zinc (Ref. 2). In addition, scientific advances permitted
the NAS to revise the values, known as ``Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes'' (ESADDI's) in 1980 for
chloride (Ref. 10) and in 1989, for three nutrients (biotin, pantothenic acid, and copper), for which FDA established
U.S. RDA's in 1973, and to establish new ESADDI's for manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum (Ref. 2). 
It was in response to these scientific advances that FDA proposed RDI's in the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60390 and 60393) for the nutrients mentioned previously that are included in the
1980 and the 1989 NAS RDA's but for which RDI's have not been established (i.e., chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese,
molybdenum, selenium, and vitamin K). The establishment of RDI's would have allowed these nutrients to be listed
on the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals as well of foods in conventional food form.
However, as stated above, section 203 of the DS act instructed FDA not to promulgate regulations that require the use
of, or that are based upon, recommended daily allowances of vitamins or minerals before November 8, 1993, other than
those specified in  101.9(c)(7)(iv), as in effect on October 6, 1992. In accordance with this provision of the
DS act, the agency issued a final rule on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2206) that retained the former U.S. RDA values. As a result,
the final rule did not include RDI's for chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and vitamin
K.
Because the prohibition in section 203 of the DS act has now expired, the agency is proposing, elsewhere in this issue
of the 

Federal Register

, to establish RDI values for those nutrients listed by the NAS as being essential to humans and that do not already have
RDI values. The agency is proposing this action because these nutrients are essential for the maintenance of good
health in humans. 
In recognition of the essentiality of these nutrients and in response to the comments summarized above, the agency
is requiring in new  101.36(b)(3) that chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and
vitamin K be included in the nutrition label when present in the dietary supplement. The agency also is providing in
 101.36(b)(4)(vi) that if any of these nutrients are declared, they are to be followed by an asterisk in the ``Percent
Daily Value'' column. The asterisk is to refer to another asterisk that is placed at the bottom of the table and that
is followed by the statement ``Daily Value not established.'' This action is a logical outgrowth of the nutrition
labeling proposal for dietary supplements because that proposal put into issue the question of whether the list of
nutrients that FDA proposed be included in the nutrition label under   101.36 was the appropriate list. The comments
have persuaded FDA that the list needs to be expanded in the manner described in this final rule.
FDA is not persuaded, however, that other trace elements for which the NAS has not established RDA's or ESADDI's should
be declared within the nutrition label. The comments that suggested that such elements be included on the label provided
some published reports that certain of these elements have been found to be essential in the diets of various animals
but did not provide sufficient evidence for the agency to conclude that there is scientific consensus about their
essentiality for the maintenance of good health in humans. The agency strongly believes that evidence of the usefulness
of a nutrient for humans is necessary before that nutrient can be allowed to be listed within the nutrition label. This
policy is consistent with current  101.9(i)(5) (redesignated and revised in the January 6, 1993, final rules,
as  101.9(k)(5)) which prohibits a food's label from stating or implying that the food has special dietary properties
because of the presence of a substance when, in fact, the usefulness of the substance has not been established in human
nutrition. 
In addition, in its proposed rule on mandatory nutrition labeling (55 FR 29487 at 29493, July 19, 1990), FDA stated
that it was concerned about the possibility of a large number of nutrients being listed in nutrition labeling and about
the way in which their presence on the label may be interpreted by consumers. FDA expressed concern that the presence
of a large number of nutrients could be misinterpreted as implying that a food has a greater public health significance
than may be the case. The potential for this happening and misleading the consumer about the contribution of the food
to human nutrition is especially likely if the nutrition label were to include nutrients not known to be important
to humans. Therefore, FDA believes that foods that list such nutrients in the nutrition label would be misbranded
under section 403(a) of the act which prohibits misleading information on the labels and labeling of foods. However,
statements about amounts and percentages can be made outside of the nutrition label as discussed in the final rule
on nutrient content claims published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
The agency is specifying that the new nutrients to be listed appear in an order that reflects the order that FDA proposed
in the nutrition labeling proposal of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60390). Vitamin K is to be listed after vitamin E with
the fat soluble vitamins, selenium is to be listed before copper, and the remaining nutrients (manganese, fluoride,
chromium, molybdenum, and chloride) are to be listed after copper at the bottom of the list. 
The agency points out that it is not allowing the listing of these nutrients on the nutrition labels of foods in conventional
food form. Under  101.9(c)(8), quantitative amounts by weight of vitamins and minerals are not listed within
the nutrition label of foods in conventional food form. As a result, the listing of only an asterisk in conjunction
with the statement ``Daily Value not established'' would provide consumers with no indication of the amount of chloride,
chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and vitamin K present in the food. Therefore, FDA has not provided
in  101.9 for a provision comparable to that in  101.36(b)(3) and (b)(4) that allows for the placement
of these nutrients on the nutrition label.
FDA wishes to point out that  101.36(a) only requires the label of a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral
to bear nutrition labeling in accordance with the provisions of  101.36 if the vitamins or minerals in the supplement
have an RDI or DRV. Accordingly, dietary supplements containing only chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese,
molybdenum, selenium, or vitamin K need not adhere to  101.36 until such time as RDI's are established for them.
2. A couple of comments said that nutrients such as fat and sodium should not be required to be declared in the nutrition
labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. One of these comments said that dietary supplements are
not taken because of their fat or sodium levels, and that these substances should not be declared. Other comments specifically
supported the proposed rule in requiring that nutrients of this type be declared when they are present.
The agency is not persuaded that nutrients such as fat and sodium should not be declared in the nutrition labeling of
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when present in significant amounts. The majority of the comments supported
FDA's view that this information is needed to fully inform consumers of the nutrient content of these products. Although
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are not consumed because of their fat or sodium levels, this type of information
on products that contain significant levels of such nutrients will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary
practices. Therefore, the agency is not making the requested change in the regulation. 
3. A few comments stated that dietary supplements of herbs and of other nutritional substances should be labeled under
 101.36. One of these comments said it would be less confusing if all supplements were labeled in the same manner.
Other comments agreed that dietary supplements of herbs should be labeled in accordance with  101.9 for foods
in conventional food form. However, at least one comment requested that dietary supplements of herbs be exempt from
declaring the ``core'' nutrients if they have to be labeled in accordance with  101.9, and another comment said
that these dietary supplements should not have to list ``Percent Daily Values.'' At least one comment stated that
dietary supplements of herbs should have their own format for nutrition labeling, and a few other comments requested
that dietary supplements of herbs be exempt from all nutrition labeling. One of these comments agreed that FDA did
not have the authority to exempt dietary supplements of herbs from  101.9 and wanted an amendment to the 1990
amendments that would exempt these dietary supplements from nutrition labeling. This comment said that dietary
supplements of herbs are not normally consumed for their nutritive value, and that nutrition labeling on these products
is irrelevant and unimportant to consumers.
As explained in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716, June 18, 1993), the
difference in the labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals and of dietary supplements of herbs and
of other similar nutritional substances is a result of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act. As stated above, this section
provides that if a food to which section 411 of the act applies (i.e., a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals)
contains one or more of the nutrients required to be listed in nutrition labeling, the label or labeling of such food
is to comply with the requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act in a manner that FDA determines, by regulation,
is appropriate for such food. Other dietary supplements are not subject to section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act and thus
are subject to regulation under section 403(q) of the act in the same manner as any other food. There is nothing in the
1990 amendments, or elsewhere in the act, that would allow the agency to exempt the broad category of dietary supplements
of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances from section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act. Thus, supplements
that are not dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are appropriately subject to nutrition labeling under
 101.9. 
Under  101.9, the nutrition label of dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances
may be presented in either a full or simplified format as specified in  101.9(d) or (f). The simplified format
in  101.9(f) may be used when a supplement of herbs or of other similar nutritional substances contains insignificant
amounts of seven or more of the following nutrients: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total
carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. 
FDA is not persuaded that nutrition labels on dietary supplements of herbs using the simplified format should be exempt
from the requirement to declare the ``core'' nutrients (i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate,
and protein). The agency has stated its belief in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2142) that
this core information is essential to aid consumers in learning about the relative nutritional qualities of all foods,
and the information allows consumers to judge the consequences of the food selections they make. No new information
was presented in the comments to change FDA's position on this issue.
The agency also advises that  101.9(j)(4) provides that foods subject to  101.9, including dietary supplements
of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances, are exempt from nutrition labeling requirements when all of
the nutrients required to be declared under  101.9(c) are absent or are present in insignificant amounts.
FDA is also not persuaded that nutrition labels on supplements of herbs should be excused from listing ``Percent Daily
Values.'' As called for in section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments, a primary purpose of the nutrition label is to
help consumers make informed food choices by enabling them to both comprehend the nutritional value of the food and
to understand its relative significance in the context of the total daily diet. The consumer research that the agency
reviewed in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule supports FDA's assertion that the listing of percent Daily
Value improves consumers' abilities to make correct dietary judgments about a food in the context of a total daily
diet (58 FR 2079 at 2125). In part, this improved ability to make judgments is achieved by the use of a consistent system
of percentages, so that virtually all the nutrients on the label can be declared in equivalent units. Also, the percentages
communicate information about the nutrient level in a food without the consumer having to be concerned about the absolute
level or units of the underlying scale being used.
Therefore, for the reasons stated, the agency has not acceded to the requests that dietary supplements of herbs and
of other similar nutritional substances be labeled under  101.36, have their own format for nutrition labeling,
be exempt from all nutrition labeling, or be exempt from declaring the ``core'' nutrients and the ``Percent Daily
Values'' in  101.9. 
4. One comment requested that the language of   101.36(a) and 101.9(j)(6) be revised to refer to ``dietary
supplements that are represented as a source of vitamins and minerals,'' instead of ``dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals.'' This comment was concerned that alfalfa tablets that have calcium as a binder would be required to
be labeled under  101.36. 
The agency would like to make clear that it does not consider a product that contains a substance that is a vitamin or
a mineral, but that is used in the food solely for technological purposes, to be a dietary supplement of a vitamin or
mineral because of the presence of that substance. In these circumstances, the product would not be represented as
supplying a vitamin or mineral (see section 411(c) of the act). Thus, alfalfa tablets that have calcium as a binder
would be required to be labeled under  101.9. 
5. A few comments requested clarification of the type of nutrition labeling that would be required for ``combination''
products that contain herbs with added vitamins. 
The agency advises that the type of nutrition labeling that would be required for products that contain herbs and added
vitamins would depend upon the contents of the product as well as how the product is represented. If a ``combination''
product is primarily a dietary supplement of vitamins and minerals and is marketed as such, the product would have
to be labeled in accordance with  101.36. If the product is not primarily a dietary supplement of vitamins or
minerals and is not represented as such, it would have to be labeled in accordance with  101.9. The agency believes
that the manufacturer makes the determination as to whether a product is primarily a dietary supplement of an herb,
of vitamins or minerals, or of a ``similar nutritional substance'' based on how it labels and formulates the product.

The types of claims that are made on a dietary supplement will both determine, and be limited by, whether it is a dietary
supplement of vitamins or minerals or of herbs or of other nutritional substances. Section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act
states that the labeling and advertising for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may not give prominence
to or emphasize ingredients that are not vitamins, minerals, or represented as a source of vitamins or minerals. Thus,
if, for example, a dietary supplement of an herbal extract adds vitamins and minerals yet remains primarily a dietary
supplement of the herbal extract and is advertised as such, section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act would not apply to the product.
This would be the case when the label of such a product made no reference to any added vitamins or minerals other than
in the ingredient list and nutrition label. Section 411(b)(2)(B) is discussed in more detail in the companion document
on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
 6. One comment requested that the language of  101.36(a) be revised to delete ``and labeling.'' The comment
says that nutrition labeling is not required on labeling under  101.9. 
The agency agrees with this comment and is revising the first sentence of  101.36(a) to delete the words ``and
labeling,'' thereby requiring that the required nutrition information appear on the label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals. FDA notes that  101.9(a)(2) allows the required nutrition information to be placed
on labeling of foods in conventional food form when such foods are not in packaged form. The types of labeling that are
identified in  101.9(a)(2) and that allow the required information to be clearly displayed at the point of purchase
are counter cards, signs, tags affixed to the product, booklets, looseleaf binders, and other appropriate devices.
The only manner in which the agency envisions that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals would not be sold in
packaged form is when they would be sold directly from bulk containers. If and when dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals are sold in this manner,  101.36(g) specifically provides that they are subject to the special
labeling provisions in  101.9(j)(16) for foods sold from bulk containers. Section 101.9(j)(16) allows for
the required nutrition information to be displayed to consumers either on the labeling of the bulk container plainly
in view or in accordance with  101.9(a)(2).


III. Nutrition Labeling of Dietary Supplements 


A. Serving Size Information 


7. At least one comment stated that information on serving size is not needed because it is given in the directions for
use. Other comments supported the proposed rule stating that serving size information should be declared in the nutrition
label.
The agency believes that information on serving size is as essential on the nutrition label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals as it is on that of foods in conventional food form. First, this information may not be given
in the directions. For instance, the directions may state ``take 3 tablets a day'' without indicating if they are to
be taken at one setting as one serving or spread out throughout the day in three separate servings. Thus, it is fair to
conclude that in many instances the serving size will not be duplicative.
Additionally, this information quickly informs the consumer about the amount of the product that contains the levels
of nutrients declared. It also provides a degree of consistency between the nutrition labels of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals and those of foods in conventional food form. FDA concluded in the mandatory nutrition labeling
final rule that if the nutrition label was to be readily observable and comprehensible, it must be presented in as consistent
a manner as possible from label to label (58 FR 2079 at 2136 and 2139). This consistent look to the required nutrition
information on packages of both dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals and foods in conventional food form
will help consumers to find and recognize the information. Consistent treatment is important for the effective use
of the nutrition label by consumers. As a result, the agency is not changing  101.36 to delete the requirement
for serving size information. 
8. One comment stated that the reference amounts for dietary supplements should be specified in absolute terms but
did not provide any data. The comment argued that absolute amounts are needed so that if comparative claims are made,
one product recommending consumption of, for example, one tablespoon per day is not compared to a product recommending
five tablespoons per day. A few other comments supported the proposed definition for reference amounts. 
The agency has defined the reference amount customarily consumed for a dietary supplement in  101.12(b) as
``the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion or, in the absence of recommendations,
one tablet, capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, as appropriate.'' As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal
on dietary supplements (54 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency relied upon labeling recommendations in this definition
because it believed that consumption is determined in large part by the amount recommended on the label of these products,
and it lacked the data to specify absolute amounts. The agency requested comments on this approach in the proposal.
No comments provided data for the agency to use in determining absolute amounts that could be used as reference amounts.
Therefore, the reference amount for dietary supplements will continue to be based on labeling recommendations.
The agency does not agree with the comment that absolute amounts are needed to prevent a product with a 1 tablespoon
serving from being compared to a product with a 5 tablespoon serving. Lacking data to the contrary, the agency must
assume that the recommended amount on the label is the amount customarily consumed. Based on that assumption, it is
consistent with  101.13, General Principles for Nutrient Content Claims, which provides for comparative
claims to be based on reference amounts customarily consumed. This topic as it relates to comparative claims is further
discussed in the companion document on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, published elsewhere in
this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
 9. A few comments stated that the term ``Serving Size'' is confusing on dietary supplements. A few comments had questions
about the determination of serving size, and one of these comments requested that the term ``Recommended Intake''
be used instead of the term ``Serving Size.'' Another comment suggested that the term ``Minimum Recommended Serving
Size'' be used when the label directions specify a range of possible intakes for a product (e.g., two to three tablets
per day). This comment was concerned that ``someone reading only the nutritional information portion of the label
will think that the serving amount listed there is the recommended amount when it is really the maximum recommended
amount.'' Other comments disagreed with this position and supported the proposed rule which stated that the serving
size should refer to the maximum amount when a range is specified for a product. 
One comment asked what the serving size is when the label recommends one to four tablets per day. This comment also asked
about serving size when the label recommends two tablets a day. Another comment supported the statement in the proposal
that if there is no amount recommended on the label, the serving size is one unit of the supplement. This comment observed
that the issue arises as to how a determination can be made of ``servings per container'' if there is no recommendation
as to serving size. The comment stated that this issue needs to be considered to avoid a regulatory gap.
The agency is not persuaded that a term other than ``serving size'' should be used to describe the basis for nutrient
declaration for dietary supplements. It would be confusing for consumers if dietary supplements of vitamins and
minerals used a term such as ``Recommended Intake'' and other foods used the term ``Serving Size.'' As discussed in
the nutrition labeling proposal on dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency proposed that the nutrition
labeling of vitamin or mineral supplements be presented in a manner that is as similar as possible to the nutrition
labeling of other foods. The agency believes that use of the same term on all labels will help to avoid confusion. As
use of the new nutrition label becomes more widespread, and consumers become familiar with it, they will come to understand
that the serving size represents the amount of product that they are likely to consume in one eating occasion. Thus,
they will come to understand that for a dietary supplement, the serving size represents the amount of that product
that they are likely to consume at those times that they decide to take the supplement. 
As explained in the proposal of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency believes that it is more useful for consumers
to have the serving size be based on the maximum amount recommended, and to have the nutrition information be reported
on this basis, than to have serving size be based on the minimum or the average amount. However, in some cases, the serving
size is the same regardless of whether the maximum or minimum amount is used. For example, if label directions recommend
a range of one to three tablets per day, the serving size is one tablet based on the fact that there are three separate
eating occasions per day. If label directions recommend a range of one to four tablets per day, the serving size is also
one tablet given the rounding rules (i.e., four divided by three, rounded off to one). As for the question what is the
serving size if the label recommends two tablets per day, the serving size would also be one tablet because of rounding.
In the absence of recommendations on the label, a serving size of one unit is appropriate for determining the ``Serving
Size'' and the ``Servings Per Container.'' 
 When the serving is one unit, the number of servings per container would duplicate the number of units declared on the
principal display panel. To avoid redundancy the agency is providing in  101.36(b)(2), as proposed, that information
on servings per container need not be provided when the identical information is stated in the net quantity of contents
declaration. However, dietary supplements in liquid or powdered form will have to declare ``Servings Per Container''
because the net quantity of contents information will be reported in net volume or net weight measures, such as fluid
ounces or grams (g), while the serving size will be expressed in common household measures, such as teaspoonfuls.

In conclusion, the agency has reexamined the proposed rule with respect to these comments on serving size and believes
that no changes are needed.
 

B. ``Amount Per Serving''


10. A few comments stated that nutrition information should not be reported on the basis of ``per serving.'' These
comments requested that the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' be replaced by the term ``Amount Per Day'' or by the terms
``Amount Per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains.''
The agency does not agree with the comment that nutrition information should be reported as ``amount per day.'' As
explained in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33717), the agency proposed
in the November 27, 1991, document (56 FR 60366 at 60383) that nutrition information be presented under the heading
of ``Per Unit,'' but that when label directions specified that more than one unit be consumed during a day, it also be
presented under the heading of ``Per Day'' (i.e., dual declaration). The agency proposed dual declaration when more
than one unit was to be consumed per day to more fully inform consumers. 
The agency received a number of comments opposing the dual declaration of nutrition information on supplements.
Some of these comments supported declaration on the basis of ``per day'' because they believed that it is the total
daily amount of nutrients that is important. Other comments favored a ``per unit'' basis because some consumers may
deviate from the recommended intake, or the intake may be presented as a range. In the preamble of the mandatory nutrition
labeling final rule of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2079 at 2168), the agency stated that dual declaration may create a readability
problem for consumers, and that in general a ``per unit'' approach was more useful than a ``per day'' approach. 
In the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33717), however, the agency took a different
approach. It stated that it had tentatively concluded that declaration on the basis of ``per serving'' is preferable
because reporting information solely on a ``per unit'' basis could confuse consumers when more that one unit is to
be consumed at one time (e.g., two capsules with each meal). The agency expressed concern that if consumers do not notice
or do not understand the heading that states ``per unit,'' they might assume that the information is for the amount
specified for consumption at one time (i.e., ``per serving''), particularly because information for foods in conventional
food form is expressed on a ``per serving'' basis. Furthermore, the agency tentatively concluded that consistency
with the labeling of foods in conventional food form in this regard is the best approach because it will reduce consumer
confusion (58 FR 33715 at 33717). 
Inasmuch as most of the comments supported the proposed rule on this issue, and comments opposing did not provide any
information demonstrating that there is enhanced consumer understanding or ease of use when information is expressed
on a daily basis, the agency is not changing  101.36(b)(3) in response to these comments. FDA has reconsidered
its position in response to comments requesting use of the terms ``Amount Per Tablet'' and ``Each Tablet Contains,''
however, in light of the comments. The agency concludes that where the serving size is one tablet, there is little,
if any, chance for misunderstanding if either of these terms is used in place of the term ``Amount Per Serving.'' Therefore,
the agency is revising  101.36(b)(3) to state that when the serving size of the product is one unit, a heading
consistent with the declaration of serving size, such as ``Amount per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains,'' may be
used in lieu of ``Amount Per Serving.'' Other appropriate terms, such as ``capsule,'' ``packet,'' or ``teaspoonful,''
may be used in place of the term ``Serving.'' While a consistent change in  101.9(d)(4) appears reasonable,
FDA believes that it is necessary to address such a change through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The agency intends
to propose such a change in the near future.


C. Nutrient Information


1. Listing of Nutrient Names and Amounts


11. Several comments recommended that information on the quantitative amount by weight for the nutrients listed
should be presented in a separate column, rather than immediately following nutrient names. These comments stated
that some consumers buy on the basis of amounts, using them to make product comparisons, and that separate columns
would help consumers to more readily locate this information. An additional comment requested that information
on amounts be presented either in a separate column or after the ``Percent Daily Value'' in parenthesis. On the other
hand, several comments supported the proposed rule, arguing that the format for dietary supplements of vitamins
or minerals should follow the format for foods in conventional food form.
The agency disagrees with the recommendation that information on the quantitative amount by weight for the nutrients
listed should be presented in a separate column. The agency observes that space on the label is conserved by not requiring
a separate column. Furthermore, FDA believes that the comprehensibility of this information will be enhanced when
it is presented immediately next to the name of the nutrient. As discussed in the mandatory nutrition labeling final
rule (58 FR 2079 at 2117), multiple column nutrient information displays are much more difficult than single column
displays for consumers to use for product comparisons. Both FDA's first experimental format study and the major industry
format study found that declaring nutrient amounts per serving in adjacent columns of grams per milligram (g/mg)
amounts and percent Daily Value led consumers to make more mistakes and to take longer on the product comparison type
of task (Refs. 3 and 4). FDA's second experimental study, however, showed that when g/mg nutrient amount information
was placed immediately next to the nutrient name in an unordered array, and percents were placed in a column array,
the adverse effects on product comparison performance disappeared (Ref. 5). Thus, the agency is requiring in  101.36(b)(3)
that the name of each nutrient listed shall be immediately followed by the quantitative amount by weight of the nutrient,
to be consistent with  101.9(d)(7)(i).
12. A few comments requested that only the calcium portion of calcium gluconate be listed in the nutrition panel and
on the principal display panel. Similarly, another comment requested that the agency clarify that vitamin B6 refers
to pyridoxine, not pyridoxine hydrochloride.
The agency wishes to emphasize that the declaration of the quantitative amount by weight in the nutrition label is
to indicate the weight of a particular nutrient and not the weight of the salt of that nutrient used to make the supplement.
For example, only the calcium portion of calcium gluconate is to be declared in the nutrition label, although in some
circumstances the weight of the whole substance may appear on the principal display panel if it clearly refers to the
whole substance, such as when the statement of identity states ``calcium gluconate, 600 mg.'' Similarly, only the
pyridoxine portion of pyridoxine hydrochloride is to be declared in the nutrition label. The agency believes that
no changes in  101.36 are necessary based on these comments. 
13. One comment recommended that biotin and folate be declared in terms of micrograms ( u g), not mg, and that calcium
and phosphorus be declared in terms of mg, not g. The comment stated that consumers are more familiar with these nutrients
being expressed in this manner.
FDA proposed on July 19, 1990 (56 FR 29476) to change to the units suggested in this comment. However, section 203 of
the DS act prohibited FDA from adopting any reference values for vitamins and minerals different from the U.S. RDA's
contained in  101.9(c)(7)(iv), as in effect on October 6, 1992, until after November 8, 1993. Accordingly,
FDA adopted those U.S. RDA values as the RDI's, with biotin and folate expressed in terms of mg and calcium and phosphorus
expressed in terms of g. 
Since the prohibition in section 203 of the DS Act has now expired, the agency is proposing elsewhere in this issue of
the 

Federal Register

 to amend  101.9 to change the units of declaration for biotin and folate to  u g and for calcium and phosphorus
to mg. This proposal responds fully to the comment. 14. One comment was opposed to the agency's proposal, in  101.36(b)(3),
to allow amounts of protein below 1 g to be left off the nutrition label. This comment requested that such amounts of
protein be declared because individuals who are highly sensitive to monosodium glutamate (MSG) may have adverse
reactions.
FDA has recognized that certain individuals are sensitive to MSG and believes that the appropriate means to convey
the presence of this ingredient to consumers is by use of the ingredient statement because MSG is a food ingredient.
The agency reiterates that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are required to comply with  101.4
(21 CFR 101.4), which requires full ingredient labeling of food. Furthermore, in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993, the agency proposed changes in the regulations pertaining to ingredient labeling to accommodate
those individuals who are sensitive to MSG. Proposed  101.22 (58 FR 2950) would require that when the amount
of free glutamate in hydrolyzed protein reaches a specified level, the declaration in the ingredient statement must
include the parenthetical ``(contains glutamate).''
The agency has reexamined proposed  101.36 in response to this comment and notes that there is an inconsistency
in the labeling of protein, total carbohydrate, and dietary fiber between  101.9 and proposed  101.36.
For example, 0.5 g to 0.99 g of these substances in a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral would not be declared
under proposed  101.36(b)(3), yet these amounts in a food in conventional food form would be declared either
as ``1 g'' or ``less than 1 g'' under  101.9(c). To correct this inconsistency, the agency is modifying  101.36(b)(3)
to provide that amounts of nutrients that can be declared as zero in the nutrition label of foods in conventional food
form shall not be declared in the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. Thus, the agency
is requiring the declaration of protein, as well as total carbohydrate and dietary fiber, when they are present in
amounts of 0.5 g to 1 g. Amounts under 0.5 g would continue to not be listed in the nutrition label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals, because these amounts would allow a declaration of zero in the nutrition labeling of foods
in conventional form. 
15. One comment recommended that ``active'' ingredients present at less than 2 percent of the Daily Value be allowed
to be listed in the nutrition label.
The agency is not allowing vitamins and minerals (except sodium and potassium, which are not included in  101.9(c)(8)(iv))
present at less than 2 percent of the Daily Value to be listed because the declaration of such amounts would be misleading.
Such values are insignificant under  101.9(f) and may be declared as 0 percent of the RDI in the nutrition labeling
of foods in conventional food form. They are amounts that are dietetically trivial and physiologically inconsequential.
In addition, FDA is concerned that some consumers will be misled by the mere presence of names of nutrients within the
nutrition label, because they would assume that products with more nutrients listed have a greater public health
significance than those with less, regardless of the amount of each nutrient present.
The agency is unaware of any reason, nor does the comment present any reason, for allowing the declaration of nutrients
that are present in such small amounts. Thus, the agency is making no change in response to this comment. 
16. One comment requested that FDA revise  101.36(b)(3)(i) to more clearly state the increments to be used for
expressing the quantitative amounts by weight of vitamins and minerals. Another comment stated that amounts should
not be rounded. This comment stated, ``We really see no reason why products should not be formulated to contain the
amounts stated on the label, subject to reasonable overages based on shelf-life considerations and the like and reasonable
analytical variation.'' 
The agency inadvertently did not address the increments to be used for expressing the quantitative amounts by weight
of vitamins and minerals. Proposed  101.36(b)(3)(i) stated that amounts of vitamins and minerals are to be
expressed in the increments specified in  101.9(c) using the units of measure and the level of significance
given in  101.9(c)(8)(iv), except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped. While the agency is adopting
this rule, FDA recognizes that, as the comment points out,  101.9(c) does not address the question of the increments
in which the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals are to be declared because in the nutrition labeling of
foods in conventional food form, vitamins, and minerals are declared only as a percentage of the Daily Value. The quantitative
amounts by weight of these nutrients, except for potassium and sodium, which are considered electrolytes, are not
required in the nutrition label of conventional foods.
The agency has considered this issue and notes that dietary supplements, unlike most foods in conventional food form,
are fabricated to contain specific amounts of vitamins and minerals. It is for this reason that the vitamins and minerals
in dietary supplements are categorized as Class I nutrients, and that under  101.9(g)(4), a food is misbranded
if it contains less of an added vitamin or mineral than the amount declared on the label. In view of how dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals are made, the agency agrees that it makes no sense to permit the amounts of vitamins and minerals
in such products to be rounded and declared only in specified increments. Therefore, the agency has modified  101.36(b)(3)(i)
to provide that the actual amounts of vitamins and minerals in the supplement are to be declared using the units of measure
specified in  101.9(c)(8)(iv), except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped. 
 With respect to levels of significance, that is, the number of decimal places used in declaring amounts, the agency
proposed that only the levels of significance shown in  101.9(c)(8)(iv) could be presented. In some cases,
however, the number of decimal places allowed is not sufficient to express actual amounts of certain vitamins and
minerals because the amounts are very small. For example, a product that contains 10 percent of the Daily Value for
copper would contain 0.2 mg of copper. If the amount of copper had to be expressed using the same level of significance
as that used in  101.9(c)(8)(iv) for expressing its RDI (i.e., 2 mg), the lowest amount that could be declared
would be 1 mg, which would be inaccurately high.
To ensure that amounts of vitamins and minerals that have nutritional significance can be declared, the agency is
modifying  101.36(b)(3)(i) to provide that amounts shall be expressed in the increments specified in  101.9(c),
except that additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient
to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for copper is given in whole mg, but the quantitative amount may be declared
in tenths of a mg). Additionally, the agency is modifying  101.36(b)(3)(i) to describe how amounts of the nutrients
from NAS' 9th and 10th editions (Refs. 2 and 10) for which RDI's have not been established are to be declared. Amounts
for chloride, fluoride, and manganese shall be expressed in mg, and amounts for chromium, molybdenum, selenium,
and vitamin K shall be expressed in  u g. These values shall be expressed in whole numbers, except that tenths may
be used for fluoride. These values reflect the amounts in which the RDI's or EASDDL's for these nutrients are given
(Refs. 2 and 10). 
17. One comment stated there was an apparent inconsistency between the requirement in  101.36(b)(3)(ii) that
nutrients ``be listed in the order specified in  101.9(c) except that calcium and iron, when present, should
be grouped with other minerals,'' and the sequence of vitamin D and vitamin E in the examples provided in  101.36(c)(8).
The comment recommended that the appropriate order of nutrients be clarified in the regulations.
While FDA finds no inconsistency with the sequence of vitamin D and vitamin E in the sample labels provided in  101.36(c)(8),
the agency points out that there was an error in the order of nutrients in  101.9(c)(8)(iv) in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2227). FDA published a correction in the 

Federal Register

 of April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17104), which listed the order as follows: Vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, vitamin D, vitamin
E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, iodine,
magnesium, zinc, and copper. This order is the one used by FDA in the June 18, 1993, proposal on nutrition labeling of
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, except that calcium and iron were listed with the minerals, following
pantothenic acid.
The agency wishes to make these regulations as clear as possible. Therefore, in response to the comment's request
for clarification of the appropriate order of nutrients, and to make clear where in the list to include the nutrients
that have no RDI but that are required to be included in the nutrition label on dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals
when they are present, FDA is revising  101.36(b)(3)(ii) to specify the exact order in which vitamins and minerals
are to be declared (see section II. comment 1. of this document). Any nutrients not present in the supplement, or present
at insignificant levels, must be omitted from the list.
 18. At least one comment requested that vitamins be listed in alphabetical order. Another comment requested that
calcium and magnesium be the first minerals to be listed.
The agency has not accepted these suggestions. As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements
(58 FR 33719), with the exception of calcium and iron, FDA proposed in  101.36(b)(3)(ii) that nutrients declared
in the nutrition labeling of vitamin or mineral supplements be listed in the order that nutrients are listed in the
nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form. The agency proposed that calcium and iron be listed after the
listing of any vitamins that are present so that all of the vitamins will be grouped together. While vitamin A and vitamin
C are to be listed first, consistent with  101.9(c), they are then followed by the fat-soluble vitamins, then
the water-soluble vitamins and the minerals. The NAS in its RDA publications has traditionally grouped the fat-soluble
vitamins ahead of the water-soluble vitamins. The agency notes that this order is followed on the labels of many vitamin
supplements in the marketplace. The comment requesting alphabetical order gave no convincing justification for
following a different order, and, thus, FDA is not changing the order. 
Additionally, the comment requesting that calcium and magnesium be the first minerals to be listed presented no reason
for the agency to make this change. Calcium and iron are required to be the first minerals listed on the labels of foods
in conventional food form. In the absence of any reason for why calcium and magnesium should be the first minerals to
be declared on the labels of supplements of vitamins and minerals, the agency is making no change in the order for minerals.
19. One comment requested that  101.36(b)(3)(ii) be revised to require that potassium be listed with the other
minerals, preferably last on the list. This comment and others expressed confusion about whether potassium could
be listed and requested clarification. One comment requested that  101.36(b)(3) be clarified to allow for
the voluntary listing of potassium in dietary supplements because, according to the comment, potassium is usually
present at less than 100 mg per tablet, primarily because of existing FDA restrictions on potassium salt preparations.

The agency agrees that the listing of potassium needs clarification. Potassium is not required to be listed on the
nutrition label of foods in conventional food form. However, it can be listed voluntarily, and when it is, it is to be
listed under sodium, as an electrolyte rather than with the minerals. In contrast, the agency proposed that potassium
be required to be listed on the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when present in supplements
at more than insignificant amounts (i.e., 5 mg and above), consistent with the listing of other vitamins and minerals.
The agency knows of no reason why potassium in supplements of vitamins and minerals should be treated differently
from other vitamins and minerals in these products, and the comment did not provide a reason for why the listing of potassium
should be voluntary rather than mandatory. Therefore, the agency is not making this change. However, the agency is
modifying the language of  101.36(b)(3) to make it clear that the declaration of potassium is required when
it is present at more than insignificant amounts. To this end, FDA has revised the second sentence of  101.36(b)(3)
to state: ``In addition, potassium * * * shall be declared, except when present at an amount that allows a declaration
of zero * * *. ''
With respect to the placement of potassium within the nutrition label, FDA agrees with the comment that the regulation
should be modified. The proposal stated that nutrients that are present shall be listed in the order specified in  101.9(c),
which would mean that potassium, as well as sodium, would precede the listing of any other vitamins or minerals present
in a supplement. FDA has concluded that it is not appropriate and might confuse consumers to have the declaration of
potassium, as well as that of sodium, precede the declaration of other vitamins and minerals on these labels because
traditionally vitamins have appeared first. The agency agrees with the comment that it is appropriate for potassium
to be listed at the bottom of the list because it is an electrolyte, and the electrolyte, chloride, is listed at the bottom.
For the same reason, the agency concludes that sodium should be listed with the other electrolytes. Accordingly,
the agency is revising  101.36(b)(3)(ii) to state that sodium and potassium should be listed, in that order,
following the electrolyte chloride at the bottom of the list of minerals.
20. One comment requested clarification regarding the labeling to be used on a package that has two compartments,
each containing a different supplement to be taken at the same time, three times daily with meals. The company asked
if the regulations permit the information for both supplements to be reported aggregately in one nutrition label
that has one column of names and amounts and one column of percent Daily Values. The firm requested that if an aggregate
label is not permitted, the additional nutrition label be permitted in a package insert. The company also asked how
the information should be presented if children one to four years of age are to take the same amount as adults, and how
it is to be presented if such children are to take half the amount of adults. 
The agency advises that if two supplements are to be taken at the same time, one unit of each three times daily, the nutrition
information for both supplements must be reported aggregately. In this situation, the serving size must clearly
state that a serving includes one of each supplement, with one column listing names and the total quantitative amount
by weight for both supplements and another column containing the total percent Daily Values. If this product is also
represented for use by children one to four years of age, the percent Daily Values for this age group would have to be
presented in a third column. In the case where the serving size is different for children, a nutrition label for adults
and a separate nutrition label for children must be used to avoid confusion. 
21. A few comments requested that the declaration of the percent of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene be mandatory. These comments argued that this information is needed to help consumers compare the amounts
of 

beta

-carotene in various products. They stated that this information would help consumers understand claims such as
``Now with 

beta

-carotene.'' One of these comments requested the voluntary declaration of the quantitative amount of 

beta

-carotene in addition to the percentage of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene. This comment stated that calculations of vitamin A and 

beta

-carotene values are difficult even for scientists, and that merely providing a percentage will not allow consumers
to readily determine just how much 

beta

-carotene is present in the product. The comment requested that the amount of 

beta

-carotene be expressed in mg. Two comments requested that the percent of vitamin A present as retinol also be mandatory.
One of these comments explained that most people are better off getting their vitamin A from 

beta

-carotene rather than from retinol because 

beta

-carotene is safer in high doses and may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, heart disease, cataracts, and other
health problems.
FDA is not persuaded that the declaration of the percent of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene should be mandatory because quantitative recommendations about the intake of 

beta

-carotene have not yet been established by the scientific community. In the July 19, 1990, mandatory nutrition labeling
proposal (55 FR 29476 at 29493), the agency set out the factors that it considered in deciding whether a nutrient or
food component should be mandatory or voluntary in nutrition labeling:


The agency has proposed to make the declaration of a nutrient or food component mandatory in nutrition labeling when
quantitative intake recommendations with respect to the nutrient or component are highlighted in the reports * *
* (e.g., ``Reduce total fat intake to 30% or less of calories.''      * * *), and the nutrient
or component is of particular public health significance as defined in several recent consensus documents * * *. On
the other hand, for those nutrients or food components for which quantitative intake recommendations are not highlighted
but that do have some public health significance * * *, or for which quantitative recommendations are available but
that are not of pressing public health importance (e.g., the Recommended Dietary Allowances for several vitamins
and minerals * * *), the agency is proposing to make declaration of the nutrient or component voluntary.


(55 FR 29487 at 29493.) 

The agency concludes that its decision to have the percent of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene be voluntary is consistent with these guidelines because quantitative intake recommendations have not
been established. On the other hand, if a claim about 

beta

-carotene is made, information on the percent of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene is needed to help consumers to understand the claim. Therefore, the agency is modifying  101.36(b)(3)(iv)
to require declaration of the percent of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene when a claim is made about 

beta

-carotene. The agency tentatively concludes that a parallel change in  101.9(c)(8)(vi) for the labels of foods
in conventional food form is appropriate. The agency intends to 
propose this change in the near future. 
The agency is accepting the comment's suggestion to provide that when the percent of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene is declared, the quantitative amount of 

beta

-carotene may also be declared voluntarily. The agency is persuaded by the comment that this information on the labels
of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals would be useful to those individuals who are interested in maintaining
a certain quantitative intake of 

beta

-carotene in their diets. 
The agency notes that the comment requested that the amount of 

beta

-carotene be declared in terms of mg. However, the agency is requiring that international units (IU) be used in place
of mg to be consistent with the declaration of vitamin A. FDA finds the usefulness of this added information would be
reduced if the units used to quantify vitamin A and 

beta

-carotene levels differ. Accordingly, the agency is amending  101.36(b)(3)(iv) to provide that when the percent
of vitamin A present as 

beta

-carotene is declared, the quantitative amount in terms of IU may also be declared, e.g., ``Vitamin A 5000 IU (90 percent
(4500 IU) as 

beta

-carotene''). The agency intends to propose a parallel change in  101.9(c)(8)(vi) as soon as possible. Until
the agency does so, the agency advises that it is unlikely that it will take enforcement action against foods regulated
under  101.9 that declare 

beta

-carotene in a manner consistent with
 101.36(b)(3)(iv) as long as they comply with  101.9 in all other respects. 
Additionally, the provision on type size requirements for the added statement on 

beta

-carotene in  101.36(c)(6) is corrected to refer to paragraph (b)(3)(iv) instead of to (b)(3)(ii). There was
an inadvertent error in this reference in the proposal. 
With respect to retinol, the agency concludes that, in accordance with the guidelines set out above, the declaration
of retinol should be neither mandatory nor voluntary because of the absence of quantitative intake recommendations
and of public health significance. Thus, the agency is not changing the proposed rule to provide for the inclusion
of retinol in the nutrition label.
22. One comment requested that  101.36(b)(3)(v) be revised to ``permit common synonyms,'' instead of only
the synonyms specified. This comment stated that allowing all synonyms would provide people with more information
and would ensure that the contents of products were, in fact, comprehensible to more people. The comment mentioned,
for example, that niacin is known by many as vitamin B3 and vitamin E by the name alpha-tocopherol. Another comment
expressed support for restricting the use of synonyms to the ones allowed in the proposed rule.
The agency is not persuaded that the provision on synonyms should be revised to ``permit common synonyms,'' instead
of only the synonyms specified. The terminology that the agency has recognized is that which is used in NAS' RDA table
(Ref. 2). These include: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin),
and calories (energy). The agency has restricted the use of synonyms to simplify nutrition labeling and to avoid potential
confusion among consumers. The agency believes that allowing the unrestricted use of other synonyms will contribute
to confusion about the nutrients that are present in the product. It will also make product comparisons more difficult
because of the absence of consistent terminology. Therefore, FDA is not making the change requested by the comment.

23. At least one comment requested that the nutrition label of vitamins with iron, for example, be allowed to highlight
the listing of iron. The comment stated that such highlighting is a useful and necessary tool to differentiate various
product lines. The agency is not persuaded that the highlighting of iron in the example described in the comment is
necessary for consumers to differentiate between various product lines because the name, or statement of identity,
of the product must identify the product as a multivitamin with iron. This identification is sufficient to differentiate
the product from other multivitamin products. As discussed in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule (58 FR
2079 at 2138), FDA is not permitting highlighting of this type because it can be used inconsistently in a way that would
be potentially misleading to consumers. Among products with similar nutrition profiles, some would highlight certain
nutrients and others would not. Consumers could not depend on the fact that all labels of similar products would look
the same, and the differences in highlighting could undermine the credibility of the information on the nutrition
label and lead to consumer confusion. Accordingly, the agency is not providing for the highlighting requested by
the comment. 
24. A number of comments suggested that the source of a vitamin or mineral be included in the nutrition label immediately
following the listing of that vitamin or mineral, in a manner similar to the allowed listing of 

beta

-carotene as a source of vitamin A. One comment stated that this information should be listed in a separate column entitled
``Source.'' One comment requested that the source information should at least be optional. The comments stated that
if this suggestion is adopted, it will be unnecessary to repeat source information in the ingredient statement, and
one comment requested that the regulations on ingredient labeling be revised accordingly. The comments said that
this approach would conserve space and more effectively communicate source information to consumers.
The agency notes that the parenthetical listing of the source of a vitamin or mineral in the nutrition label is a common
practice by some, but not all, manufacturers in the dietary supplement industry. The agency finds, however, that
the comments submitted failed to provide adequate justification and supporting information demonstrating that
adoption, on an industry-wide basis, of this manner of expressing nutrition and ingredient information would result
in a nutrition label that is readily observable and comprehensible, as required by the act. Comments have not demonstrated
that consumers will be able to distinguish and understand the meaning of both the nutrition and ingredient information
provided. FDA has no means on which to determine, for example, whether the name of the source of the nutrient is indeed
that and not the chemical name of the nutrient. The comments also failed to provide data to demonstrate that this manner
of presentation truly conserves label space, especially if additional columns are added to the nutrition label.
Further, if as suggested by one comment, source information within the nutrition label were made optional, the consistency
of presentation of information that has been a guiding principle of the agency throughout the food label reform efforts
would be violated. Accordingly, the agency is not providing for the parenthetical listing of nutrient source within
the nutrition label.
The agency advises, however, that it would be receptive to a adequately supported petition on this issue, and that
it will act expeditiously on such petition. Given that, elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the agency is establishing a date of applicability of July 1, 1995, for the regulation governing nutrition labeling
of dietary supplements, if a petition is promptly submitted, that petition could be acted upon before the date of applicability.
Any petition submitted to permit source declaration within the nutrition label would have to address, in detail,
at least the issues of how the source information is to be consistently and clearly expressed, and why this manner of
expression is advantageous to the consumer.
Because a primary purpose of the nutrition label is to allow consumers to compare the nutrition profile of products
at the point of purchase, it is imperative that there be a high degree of consistency in the presentation of nutrition
information for all dietary supplements. FDA would also need information on precisely how source information should
be expressed within the nutrition label. For example, how would the source information be expressed if a single ingredient
(e.g., fish liver oil) is a source of a number of nutrients (e.g., vitamins A and D) within a dietary supplement? If the
source is required to be listed multiple times, how does this conserve label space? Also, would multiple listing of
a source mislead consumers about the amount of the ingredient in the food? Conversely, if a nutrient in a supplement
is provided from several sources (e.g., iodine from kelp and potassium iodide), how would this information be clearly
and consistently conveyed? Would the source listed be all sources, or only the primary source, of the nutrient? If
source listing in the nutrition label were to be limited to the primary source, how would the primary source be determined?
Are safeguards necessary to ensure that consumers are not misled by inappropriate emphasis on certain sources of
nutrients? For example, how would consumers be fully informed and be protected from being misled if a nutrient is derived
from more than one source, and only the primary source is listed, particularly if a valued ingredient provides some,
but not all, of the nutrient in question?
Should source information be permitted in the nutrition label only when there is some significance to the source?
For example, because there are potential safety concerns about high intakes of vitamin A from some other sources,
FDA found that there is was a public health reason for permitting 

beta

-carotene to be shown as a source of vitamin A. Should such a finding be a prerequisite for permitting source labeling?
If source labeling is limited to cases in which the source is significant (e.g., particularly valued sources, concern
about other potential sources), how should such significance be consistently determined?
Also, any petition on source labeling in the nutrition label should address the issue of clarity of presentation.
Section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments states that the nutrition information should be readily observable and
comprehensible. Would adding information about the source of nutrients detract from the comprehensibility of the
nutrition label? Given that source information will be available in the ingredient statement, would source declarations
unnecessarily burden the nutrition label and detract from its primary purpose of providing a nutrient profile of
the product? Would it be more difficult for consumers to find the listing of the quantitative amounts by weight of nutrients
in the nutrition label when source information is given? Petitions on this issue would be strengthened by the inclusion
of consumer survey or other similar data showing that consumers readily observe and comprehend information presented
in the manner suggested by the comments.
As discussed in the mandatory labeling final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2170), dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals,
like other foods, are required to bear a complete list of ingredients. Under section 403(i)(2) of the act, the statement
of ingredients must list all ingredients of these foods, including , for example, lactose and other fillers, artificial
colors, flavors, binders, and excipients, as well as the source of the vitamins and minerals in the dietary supplement.
This section of the act provides FDA with authority to grant exemptions from the ingredient listing requirements,
but such exemptions have not been sought by the dietary supplement industry. The agency advises that the fact that
the name of an ingredient appears elsewhere on the label is not, in and of itself, sufficient justification to grant
such exemptions. Therefore, any petition on this subject must address the issue of how this manner of presentation
of the source of nutrients continues to fulfill the primary purpose of the ingredient label to adequately inform consumers
about all ingredients used to make a food, including those that might be of concern because of personal health reasons
(e.g., lactose).
The agency advises that its current policy, as stated in the 

Federal Register

 of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20730) and March 16, 1979 (44 FR 16005), and in subsequent correspondence with industry (Refs.
6 and 7), is that the label for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals must contain a list of nutrients and a separate
full statement of ingredients, except those exempted by section 403(i)(2) of the act, declared by their common or
usual name. This policy is consistent with the ingredient declaration requirements for other types of products.
Therefore, for all the reasons cited above, FDA has decided not to take the action requested by these comments, pending
receipt and review of petitions on this issue.


2. Listing of Percent Daily Value 


25. The agency received a number of comments that opposed the use of the term ``Percent Daily Value'' and that stated
that they preferred to continue to use the term ``percent U.S. RDA.'' 
The agency disagrees with these comments. As explained in the final rule on RDI's that published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2206 at 2207 and 2208), the agency has established two sets of label references values (i.e.,
RDI's, which were previously the U.S. RDA's, and DRV's). Because the agency believed the use of the two terms on food
labels could be confusing to consumers, it established a single term, ``Daily Value'' to refer to both the RDI's and
DRV's (58 FR 2079 at 2124). The comments did not provide any new arguments or data that were not considered in that rulemaking.
Furthermore, the agency advises that it knows of no reason why dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals should
not use the terminology prescribed for foods in general. Consistency in terminology will assist consumers in maintaining
healthy dietary practices by facilitating their use of the nutrition label to construct a healthy diet that includes
both dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form. Therefore, the agency is not making any change in the
regulations in response to these comments.
26. One comment requested that the agency eliminate the use of the term ``RDI'' and use the term ``DRV'' for both macronutrients
and micronutrients. The comment stated that it is confusing to have more the one term. 
The comment appears to be requesting new terms not only for the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals but also for the nutrition label of foods in conventional food form. The terms ``RDI'' and ``DRV'' were
established in the final rule on RDI's (58 FR 2206).
As discussed in the proposed rule of July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29476 at 29479), the distinction between the RDI's and DRV's
is necessary for several reasons. First, the RDI's are based on the RDA's, which are considered intake levels to be
achieved. However, while some DRV's are based on recommendations to increase or maintain intake of the particular
food component, other DRV's reflect levels that are limitations on intake. Furthermore, many of the DRV's must be
based on a specific caloric intake, and, unlike the RDI's, the DRV's are not relevant for infants and young children.
Finally, the RDI's serve as criteria for use in several regulatory functions, such as the application of the agency's
food fortification policy and the assessment of the nutritional equivalency of imitation foods. The DRV's do not
have such uses. Therefore, FDA believes that it is appropriate to treat RDI's and DRV's as two different sets of reference
values. However, the agency notes that both terms are referred to as ``Daily Values'' on the nutrition label. The agency
believes that the use of a single term on the label will limit consumer confusion. Thus, the concern articulated by
the comment is fully addressed by FDA's current regulatory scheme. Accordingly, the agency is not making the requested
change. 
27. One comment requested that products containing 5 to 17 mg of potassium should be allowed to state, ``Contains less
than 1 percent of the Daily Value of this nutrient.'' The comment explained that 17 mg of potassium expressed to the
nearest whole percent comes to ``0 percent Daily Value'' (3,500 mg divided by 17, which rounds to zero), yet  101.9(c)(5)
only allows amounts less than 5 mg to be considered as zero. As a result, the nutrition label of such a product would state
15 mg potassium and 0 percent Daily Value. The comment expressed concern that such apparently contradictory statements
would be confusing to consumers.
The comment identifies a concern applicable to dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form, namely that
consumers may find it confusing when there is a quantitative amount by weight for a nutrient, and yet the percent Daily
Value states 0 percent. This seeming conflict can occur with sodium, potassium, and total carbohydrate on labels
of both supplements and foods in conventional food form, and with some vitamins and minerals in dietary supplements,
when both quantitative amounts by weight and percent Daily Values are given. To avoid any possible confusion that
these apparently inconsistent declarations may cause, the agency is modifying  101.36(b)(4)(ii) to provide
for the declaration of ``less than 1%'' in the percent of Daily Value column when the declaration of the quantitative
amount by weight is greater than zero, and the calculation of percent Daily Value yields a value that is less than 1 percent.
The agency believes that a parallel change in  101.9(d)(7)(ii) for foods in conventional food form is appropriate.
The agency intends to propose this change in the near future. Additionally, the agency notes that, consistent with
 101.9(d)(7)(ii), as modified in the technical amendments (58 FR 44063 at 44077, August 18, 1993), it is modifying
 101.36(b)(4)(i) to specify that the percent of Daily Value shall be calculated by dividing either the amount
declared on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the RDI or DRV
for the specified nutrient and multiplying by 100. The agency is making this change to provide for consistency on the
food label between the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amount by weight. The agency had previously provided
only that the amount declared be used in the calculation.
28. One comment requested clarification of  101.36(b)(4)(iii), which provides that when a product is represented
or purports to be for use by a group other than adults and children older than 4 years of age, the percent Daily Value for
each group must be presented in separate columns. The comment asked if the label of a product represented for use ``for
the family'' would have to include information for all of the groups for which FDA has established RDI's.
The agency believes that it is appropriate for the label of a product represented for use ``for the family'' to include
information for adults and children older than 4 years of age and for children younger than 4 years of age because families
often include children in this age group. Inasmuch as there generally would be safety concerns in feeding infants
supplements intended for use by adults, FDA also advises that the statement ``for the family'' should be modified
to specifically exclude infants if a firm wants to include only a single list of RDI values. The agency does not believe
that this comment requires any change in the language of the proposed rule. However, the agency advises that for clarity,
it has changed the word ``additional'' in  101.36(b)(4)(iii) to ``separate.'' 


D. Format 


29. One comment requested that the first sentence in  101.36(c)(1), ``The title of 
'Nutrition Facts
' shall be set in type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, unless impractical, shall
be set full width of the nutrition label,'' be revised to use the term ``nutrition panel'' instead of ``nutrition label.''
The comment stated that the ``nutrition label'' could be interpreted to mean the whole label, in which case the phrase
``Nutrition Facts'' would have to be the biggest print on the label. 
The agency is not persuaded that this revision is needed. In proposed  101.36 and in  101.9, the agency
has consistently used the term ``nutrition label'' to refer to the nutrition information set off in a box presented
under the heading of ``Nutrition Facts.'' Extensive changes would be required in both regulations to make consistent
changes wherever the term ``nutrition label'' is used. Because no other comments indicated a similar concern, the
agency is not making the requested change. 
30. One comment requested that  101.36 be revised to clarify that selective reverse printing may not be used
as a form of highlighting, consistent with  101.9(d)(1)(iv).
The agency agrees with this comment. It unintentionally failed to address reverse printing in  101.36. In the
nutrition labeling final rule, FDA decided not to permit reverse printing as a form of highlighting because it would
interfere with the ``consistent'' look of the label (56 FR 2079 at 2138). For the same reason, the agency is not permitting
reverse printing on the nutrition labels of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals. Accordingly, the agency
has revised the second sentence of  101.36(c)(1) to read ``The title and all headings shall be highlighted (reverse
printing is not permitted as a form of highlighting) to distinguish them from other information.''
31. One comment stated that labels of multivitamin supplements and multivitamin/multimineral supplements that
have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 10 or less square inches should be exempt from the requirement
in  101.36(c)(4) that all information within the nutrition label shall have at least one point leading (i.e.,
space between two lines of text). Other comments stated that this provision of the proposed rule is appropriate.
The agency is not persuaded that the nutrition label on small labels should be exempt from the requirement of at least
one point leading. This requirement is much less than that required for foods in conventional food form (e.g., four
point is required between nutrients in  101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and does little more than insure that lines of text
do not touch). As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33721), the
agency proposed at least one point leading because of concerns about legibility. To maintain a consistent and distinctive
format that is legible, some leading is necessary. Accordingly, FDA is providing for the minimal leading of one point
in the nutrition labeling of dietary supplement of vitamins and minerals and encourages manufacturers to use more
leading whenever possible. FDA is not making a similar change for dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar
nutritional substances because comments did not demonstrate space concerns with those products that would justify
such a change. 
Many of the changes in this document will help reduce space requirements (e.g., type size changes). If a manufacturer
finds that it is still technologically infeasible or impracticable to fit the nutrition label on a particular package,
it may write to the Office of Food Labeling as provided in  101.36(d)(2).
32. One comment requested that the kerning requirements be deleted, and that instead, the regulation state that ``letters
should never touch,'' consistent with the technical amendments to  101.9 published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR
44063 at 44065). Another comment requested that labels that are less than 10 square inches should be exempt from the
requirement in proposed  101.36(c)(5) that all information within the nutrition label shall have type that
is kerned (i.e., has proximity of placement) no tighter than -4 setting. At least one comment supported this provision
of the proposed rule.
 The agency agrees that the kerning requirements should be made consistent with that for the nutrition labels on packages
of foods in conventional food form. As pointed out in a similar comment with respect to the labeling of foods in conventional
food form (58 FR 44063 at 44065), a numeric kerning value (which in effect limits the proximity of one letter to another)
has meaning only for a particular type setting system. Each such system has a unique numeric scale, and, as a result,
a setting of -4 is meaningless for systems other than the one that FDA used in designing its sample labels. The agency
acknowledges its error in including a single kerning limit that would be required for all type setting systems. Accordingly,
FDA is revising  101.36(c)(5), consistent with  101.9(d)(1)(ii)(D), to delete the requirement for
a -4 setting and to state that letters should never touch. 
33. A couple of comments supported the provision in proposed  101.36(c)(6) regarding type size, but more than
ten comments strongly opposed the provision. The agency proposed to require type size no smaller than 8 point for nutrient
information within the nutrition label and to allow no smaller than 6 point type for column headings and footnotes.
In addition, the agency proposed to allow no smaller than 6 point type for all of the information within the nutrition
label of packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches. The comments said
that the total surface area available for labeling for most dietary supplements is well under 40 square inches. They
stated that the proposed 6 point minimum type size is far too large for many labels to include all of the required nutrition
information and to still allow space for the ingredient statement, necessary product codes, lot number, expiration
dates, Universal Product Code (UPC) symbols, front panel copy, and other information commonly provided on dietary
supplement labels. To alleviate this space problem, a number of comments requested that FDA allow smaller type size.
One comment requested a minimum type size of 3.0 point and another 4.0 point. However, most of the comments suggested
a minimum type size of 4.5 point, which they said is consistent with the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association
(NDMA) Label Readability Guidelines used for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. 
The comments were divided about when FDA should allow smaller print size. A few comments believed that smaller type
is needed on labels having up to 40 square inches of total surface area. Other comments suggested that such type is necessary
on various-sized labels, such as those with surface areas of less than 25, 15, 12, and 10 square inches. Finally, a few
comments suggested that the regulation should state that type size should be ``as large as possible,'' or that it should
permit manufacturers to decide for themselves. 
After reviewing many dietary supplement labels, the agency is persuaded that the 6 point minimum type size proposed
for nutrition labeling information is too large for many multivitamin and multimineral supplement labels. The agency
acknowledges that these products often have many nutrients to declare in the nutrition label, are often sold in relatively
small packages/jars, and include on the label other information not required for foods in conventional food form.
Therefore, FDA is accepting the recommendation, supported by the NDMA Label Readability Guidelines, that 4.5 point
minimum type size be allowed on smaller labels. Throughout rulemaking to implement the 1990 amendments, FDA has responded
to consumer concerns that the required nutrition information be presented in a manner that will improve legibility,
particularly to help older and vision-impaired consumers who otherwise would be effectively denied access to the
nutrition information. Because type size is a major determinant of legibility, FDA does not believe type sizes less
than 4.5 points should be allowed on package labels and encourages manufacturers to use larger type size when label
space allows.
The agency finds that this minimum type size of 4.5 points is appropriate on packages having less than 12 square inches
of surface area available to bear labeling. The agency selected less than of 12 square inches of area available to bear
labeling as a result of its review of the comments and because it promotes consistency within food labeling regulations
inasmuch as  101.2(c)(3)(i) uses this package size as the standard for exempting small packages of foods from
type size requirements, and  101.9(j)(13)(i) uses it to differentiate which food packages may use a telephone
number or address for consumers to use in obtaining nutrition information as the functional equivalent of a nutrition
label if no nutrient content or health claims are made on the label. The agency also finds that this decision is reasonable
considering the practical need for smaller packages containing supplements composed of many vitamins and minerals
to have smaller print, and the need for all labels to be as legible as possible. Therefore, the agency is modifying  101.36(c)(6)
to allow for packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches to use 4.5
point type size. FDA is not making a similar change for dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional
substances because comments did not demonstrate the same space concerns for those products. Additionally, the agency
is correcting  101.36(c)(6) to refer to paragraph (b)(3) instead of to (b)(4) and to refer to paragraph (b)(4)
instead of to (b)(4)(ii). There were inadvertent errors in these references in the proposal.
FDA advises that under  101.36(g), dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may also use all provisions
allowed in  101.9(j)(13) to help accommodate the nutrition label on small and intermediate-sized packages.
 If, despite these provisions, there are still packages for which there is insufficient area available to print all
required information, the agency advises manufacturers to write to the Office of Food Labeling, FDA (HFS-150),
on a case-by-case basis requesting alternative means of compliance (e.g., reduced type size or leading) in accordance
with  101.36(d)(2). 
34. One comment requested that all upper case lettering be allowed for multivitamin and multimineral labels that
are less than 25 square inches in total available surface area to facilitate readability. Other comments agreed with
proposed  101.36(c)(3), which requires that all information within the nutrition label utilize upper and
lower case letters.
In the technical amendments published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 18, 1993, the agency modified  101.9(j)(13)(i)(B) to allow all upper case lettering to be used on packages
of food in conventional food form that have less than 12 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling (58
FR 44063 at 44072). To be consistent, the agency has modified  101.36(c)(3) to allow packages of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals that have less than 12 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling to use all upper
case lettering. To maximize legibility and to preserve the readily identifiable image of the nutrition label, FDA
is limiting this special provision to small packages (i.e., those with less than 12 square inches of surface area)
rather than the 25 square inches requested in the comment.
 35. A few comments suggested ways to alleviate space problems other than by using a smaller type size. One comment wanted
to be able to present the nutrition label on any package panel, to use the tabular or linear method of listing nutrients,
and to use the abbreviations specified in  101.9(j)(13)(ii). Another comment requested that the entire labeling,
not just the label on the primary container, be allowed to be used to relate nutrition information. One comment requested
that all supplements with less than 40 square inches of label space be exempt from having a large heading entitled ``Nutrition
Facts,'' a box that surrounds the nutrition panel, and the lines that separate each individual nutrient and the headings.
Other comments requested that the nonfunctional slack-fill regulations be revised to allow containers to be bigger.
The agency notes that  101.36(g) provides, in part, that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are subject
to, among other provisions, the special labeling conditions set out in  101.9(j)(13) for foods in small and
intermediate-sized packages. Section 101.9(j)(13)(i) defines a small package as one that has a total surface area
available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches and allows for the use of an address or telephone number that
a consumer can use to obtain the required information (e.g., ``For nutrition information, call 1-800-123-4567'')
as the functional equivalent of a nutrition label if no nutrient content or health claims are made on the label. When
foods in small packages either voluntarily or because of nutrition claims bear nutrition labeling,  101.9(j)(13)(i)(B)
also allows the use of smaller type size than that required on larger packages. 
Section 101.9(j)(13)(ii) defines an intermediate-sized package as one that has a total surface area available to
bear labeling of 40 or less square inches. This section of the regulations provides several additional special labeling
provisions to assist manufacturers in fitting the required information on both small and intermediate-sized packages.
These provisions, which can apply to dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals in small or intermediate-sized
packages, include using specified abbreviations and presenting the required nutrition information on any label
panel. Additionally, this section provides for presenting the required information in a tabular (i.e., horizontal)
display or linear (i.e., string) fashion: (1) If the product has a total surface available to bear labeling of less
than 12 square inches, or (2) if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches,
and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a column display on any panel. Nutrition information may be given
in a linear fashion only if the label will not accommodate a vertical or tabular display. 
In response to the comment requesting use of labeling, not just the label on the primary container, to convey nutrition
information, the agency advises that it has traditionally required that all required information (e.g., the statement
of identity, net weight statement, ingredient list, name and place of manufacture, and nutrition information) appear
on the label of packaged foods. Labeling, which includes materials not affixed to the package (such as posters, notebooks,
leaflets, and brochures available at the point of purchase), may become separated from the packaged food and are inappropriate
for the delivery of required information. Therefore, FDA concludes that it would not be appropriate to grant the request
in this comment.
However, FDA considers outer packaging that securely encloses a primary container and that is not intended to be separated
from the primary container under conditions of retail sale to be the equivalent of the product label. Therefore, when
a bottle containing a dietary supplement in tablet, granular, or liquid form is placed within a sealed box, the required
information must be present on the outer container where it is available to the consumer at the point of purchase. While
FDA regulations do not require that the information be repeated on the primary container inside the box, the agency
encourages manufacturers to do so, so that consumers will have easy access to the information once the container is
removed from the outer box. Likewise, if supplements are sold in sealed packaging that provides a cardboard display
around the primary container, the full display seen by the consumer becomes the product label. In these situations,
the required information shall be placed on appropriate panels as directed in   101.1 and 101.2, pertaining
to the principal display panel and the information panel, respectively.
It would not be consistent with section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments to allow packaging with less than 40 square
inches of label space to be exempt from graphic requirements such as having the title ``Nutrition Facts'' in the largest
print within the nutrition label, having the required information enclosed within a box, and using hairlines to separate
nutrients and headings. As stated above, the agency concluded in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule (58
FR 2079 at 2136) that if the nutrition label was to be readily observable and comprehensible, it must be presented in
as consistent a manner as possible from label to label. Thus, in establishing the requirements for the nutrition label,
the agency went to great lengths to give the format a distinctive look (e.g., through the use of a prominent heading,
highlighting of key nutrient information, and enclosure of the information in a box) to facilitate consumer recognition
of the label and to encourage use of the information. Consistency of appearance begins to be lost if these graphic elements
are omitted on certain packages. Such action would make it likely that some consumers would fail to recognize the nutrition
information and to understand the significance of the information that it presented. For this reason, FDA is not providing
the flexibility requested. 
However, the agency has reviewed the format requirements in response to these comments concerned about space problems.
To help alleviate space problems, the agency has concluded that it can provide for flexibility in the placement of
the heading,
``% Daily Value.'' When a dietary supplement contains less than 5 calories per serving, ``Calories'' need not be declared.
In this situation, shown in the sample labels in  101.36(c)(8) of the proposal (58 FR 33715 at 33728 through 33730),
the heading ``% Daily Value'' is placed to the right and under the bar beneath the heading ``Amount Per Serving.'' Because
there is sufficient space on one line for both headings, the agency is modifying  101.36(b)(4) to provide that
the heading ``% Daily Value'' may be placed on the same line as the heading ``Amount Per Serving,'' when calorie information
is not required to be declared. 
Also, consistent with provisions in  101.9(d)(11)(i) and (ii) that allow lower portions of the vertical format
to be split and moved to the contiguous right, FDA is providing in  101.36(c)(10) that, if space is not adequate
to list the required information in one vertical list (as shown in the sample labels in  101.36(c)(9)), the list
may be split and the lower information moved to the right as long as the headings are repeated. The list to the right should
be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the nutrients and the percent Daily Value information
given to the left. A sample of this split format is included in  101.36(c)(10). 
The agency is not convinced by the comment that the nonfunctional slack-fill regulations should be revised to allow
containers of dietary supplements to be larger than otherwise necessary to accommodate the labeling requirements.
As discussed in the final rule on nonfunctional slack-fill (58 FR 64123 at 64134, December 6, 1993), the agency knows
of no reason for treating dietary supplements differently from foods in conventional food form. In response to this
and the other comments suggesting ways to alleviate space constraints, the agency advises that many of the changes
that FDA has made from the proposal will help to reduce space requirements (e.g., reduced type size requirements on
packages of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals). If manufacturers find that it is still technologically
infeasible or impracticable to fit the nutrition label on a particular package, they may write to the Office of Food
Labeling as directed in   101.9(g)(9) and 101.36(d)(2). The agency points out that any information,
other than the net quantity of contents and statement of identity, may be printed parallel to the base of a package.
Thus, the nutrition label may be printed parallel to the base of a package, which may provide more space for this information.
However, FDA urges manufacturers to strive for consistency of presentation of nutrition information in the market.
36. One comment requested that hairlines be required to separate lines of nutrient declarations, and that these hairlines
be centered between the lines of text. This comment also requested clarification that Appendix B to part 101, which
is referenced in  101.36(c)(8), contains several nonrequired elements, such as Helvetica typeface, at least
13 point type for ``Nutrition Facts,'' and a specific thickness for the separating bars on the nutrition label. 
As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency intends
that the nutrition labeling on vitamin or mineral supplements be presented in a manner that is as similar as possible
to the nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form. Hairlines are required in the nutrition labeling of
foods in conventional food form as specified in  101.9(d)(1)(v). The agency intended that  101.36 contain
a similar provision. However, it inadvertently failed to specifically provide for hairlines in the proposed rule,
although it included hairlines in the samples labels presented in proposed  101.36(c)(9) and urged that the
graphic specifications set forth in Appendix B to part 101 be followed. These graphic specifications describe the
use of hairlines under C-2. Accordingly, the agency concludes that it is appropriate to modify  101.36(c) to
require hairlines in  101.36(c)(7) and to redesignate paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) as paragraphs (c)(8) and
(c)(9), respectively, to reflect this modification. New  101.36(c)(7) states: ``A hairline rule that is centered
between the lines of text shall separate each nutrient and its corresponding percent Daily Value required in paragraph
(b)(4) of this section from the nutrient and percent Daily Value above and below it, as shown in paragraph (c)(9) of
this section, and shall separate 'Amount Per Serving' from the calorie statement, when the listing of calories is
required.'' 
With respect to Appendix B, the comment is correct in stating that Appendix B contains several nonrequired elements,
such as Helvetica typeface, a specified type size for the title ``Nutrition Facts,'' and a specific thickness for
the separating bars on the nutrition label. The required graphic elements are specified in  101.36(b) and (c).
37. A couple of comments objected to the bar at the bottom of the nutrition label and requested that this requirement
be deleted. They stated that it is unnecessary and may interfere with the scanning of the UPC symbol. Another comment
requested that  101.36(c) be revised to require a bar following the final vitamin or mineral listed. Other comments
supported the proposal. 
 In  101.36(b)(3)(ii), FDA proposed to require a bar at the bottom of the nutrition label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals to help ensure that the nutrition label on these types of foods has the same readily identifiable
image, or ``look,'' as the nutrition label on foods in conventional food form (58 FR 33715 at 33719). Comments to the
agency's proposed rule on the format for nutrition labeling (57 FR 32058, July 20, 1992) had argued that a consistent
look to the required nutrition information on food packages will help consumers find the information on the package
and to recognize it for what it is--a profile of the nutrient content of the food. These comments convinced FDA that
the specific format elements mandated provide a visually integrated image that will give the nutrition label a uniform
appearance across the various types of packages in the market and will enhance consumer use of the information. Nothing
in the comments on proposed  101.36 provide the basis for a different conclusion. FDA finds that contrary to
the comments' assertion, this bar contributes directly to the consistent look of the nutrition label. To avoid any
possible interference of the bar at the bottom of the nutrition label with the scanning of the UPC symbol, manufacturers
may design the package layout so that the UPC symbol is not adjacent to the nutrition label. Accordingly, the agency
is not modifying  101.36(b)(3)(ii) in response to these comments. 
38. One comment requested that bars be required after ``Serving Size'' and ``Amount Per Serving.''
The agency points out that  101.36(b)(3) requires that the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' be separated from
other information on the label by a bar above and beneath it. Thus, the upper bar will be beneath the declaration of ``Servings
Per Container'' or, when ``Servings Per Container'' is not required, of ``Serving Size.'' The lower bar would separate
the declaration ``Amount Per Serving'' from the heading ``Percent Daily Value.'' The agency notes that this bar should
follow information on calories, when that information is declared (i.e., when the dietary supplement of vitamins
and minerals contains 5 or more calories), to be consistent with the labeling of foods in conventional food form ( 101.9(d)(6)).
However, the agency inadvertently failed to specify in the proposed rule where this bar should be placed. As discussed
in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency intended that the nutrition
labeling on vitamin and mineral supplements be presented in a manner as similar as possible to the nutrition labeling
of foods in conventional food form. Therefore, FDA finds that it is the logical outgrowth of the proposal to specify
in this final rule where the bar following ``Amount Per Serving'' should be placed when information on calories is
declared in a nutrition label for a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals. Accordingly, the agency is modifying
 101.36(b)(3) to state: ``The heading 
'Amount Per Serving
' shall be separated from other information on the label by a bar above and beneath it, except when calories are
listed, the bar shall be placed beneath the calorie declaration.'' 


E. Compliance and Exemption Issues 


39. At least three comments requested that dietary supplements be able to indicate compliance with United States
Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements. One of these comments requested that a new paragraph,  101.36(d)(3), be
added that would provide that the label could bear a box entitled ``Nutrition Facts'' that would contain nutrition
information for USP recognized substances that are the source of vitamins and minerals. Immediately below that box,
the label would bear another section entitled, ``Other Ingredients'' that would list all additional ingredients
present in more than insignificant amounts, followed by a listing of all other added substances incorporated in the
product as excipients. The comment stated that by listing all other ingredients present, consistency with section
411(b)(2)(A)(i) of the act would be achieved. Alternatively, this comment requested that the following sentence
be added after the first sentence of  101.36(d)(2): ``Such allowances will also be considered where a firm produces
an article that purports to comply with the requirements of the official USP and seeks to label it in accordance with
the requirements of the Pharmacopeia.'' The comment stated that this new sentence would allow firms to comply with
USP labeling requirements with FDA's permission. Additionally, this comment requested that the name of products
that meet USP quality standards be followed by the letters ``USP.''
Both of the comment's suggested changes in  101.36(d) would allow for two very different forms of nutrition
labeling on dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, depending upon whether a manufacturer chose to follow
FDA's requirements, which are generally consistent with  101.9, or USP's, which would list only USP recognized
nutrients in the top box. A manufacturer's decision to follow the USP approach would result in a nutrition label that
was inconsistent with labels of other dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, with dietary supplements of
herbs and other similar nutritional substances, and with foods in conventional food form. The comment also appears
to request that the determination of whether or not a nutrient should be listed in the nutrition label should be based
upon its USP status.
FDA finds that it would not be consistent with section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments to provide the flexibility
sought by these comments. As discussed in response to earlier comments, the agency decided in the mandatory nutrition
labeling final rule that if the nutrition label was to be readily observable and comprehensible, it must be presented
in as consistent a manner as possible from label to label. Thus, it was the agency's determination that, whenever possible,
nutrition labeling requirements should ensure a distinctive look and order of nutrients to facilitate consumer
recognition and understanding of the label and to encourage use of the information. Allowing two different nutrition
labeling schemes would make it likely that some consumers would fail to recognize the nutrition information or would
be too confused to be able to use it fully. FDA has made the same decision with respect to dietary supplements and thus
is not providing the flexibility requested. However, in regard to the request that the name of ingredients of USP quality
be allowed to indicate USP status, the agency advises that although statements appearing outside of the nutrition
label are beyond the scope of this final rule, it would not object to the use of truthful and nonmisleading statements
regarding USP status elsewhere on product labels. Further, FDA would not object to the use of the USP symbol in the ingredient
list to identify those ingredients that are USP grade. The agency advises that it will not consider the USP symbol,
when used in this way, to constitute intervening material in the ingredient list. 
 40. One comment requested that FDA recognize USP methodology. This comment stated that  101.36(d)(1) requires
that dietary supplements comply with  101.9(g)(2), which specifies Association of Official Analytical Chemists
(AOAC) test methodology for nutrient analysis.
The agency wishes to clarify that  101.9(g)(2) states that when FDA determines compliance, it will analyze
composite samples by appropriate methods as given in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,''
15th edition, or, if no AOAC method is available or appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures.
Manufacturers, however, are free to use whatever methodology they believe will give results consistent with methods
used by FDA. Therefore, the requested change is unnecessary. 
41. One comment requested that the compliance criteria be revised to allow the actual content of any vitamin or mineral
in a dietary supplement to be 90 percent, instead of at least 100 percent, of the declared value. This comment stated
that the proposed rule (i.e.,  101.36(d)(1), which refers to  101.9(g)(1) through (g)(2)) requires
that products that contain added vitamins and minerals provide at least the amount declared for each nutrient. The
comment stated that consideration should be given to the fact that many dietary supplements, while formulated to
contain at least 100 percent of the declared amount, are designed to retain only at least 90 percent of their declared
amount over the shelf life declared on these products. The comment attributed this practice to the fact that USP monographs
for several nutritional products require a minimum nutrient content of 90 percent of the label declaration. 
The agency is not persuaded by this comment. As previously discussed in response to a similar comment in the mandatory
nutrition labeling final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2171), dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are fabricated products.
The comments provided no convincing reason for why they should not be held to the same standards as foods in conventional
food form that are fortified or enriched. The agency has informed USP that anything less than 100 percent of the value
declared on the label for vitamin and mineral products is not acceptable to FDA, and that the only permissible deviation
from this requirement would be a deviation that is attributable to the variability of the analytical method (Ref.
8). 
The agency notes that, contrary to the statement in the comments, the General Notices of the USP state that a dosage
should be formulated to provide 100 percent of the labeled amount (Ref. 9). The limits in the USP monographs allow for
overages of ingredients known to decrease with time, for analytical error, for manufacturing and compounding variations,
and for deterioration to an extent considered insignificant under practical conditions (Ref. 9). 
42. One comment pertained to small businesses. The comment stated that ``burdening the manufacturer with the cost
of the nutrition labeling requirements (listing that a vitamin supplement contains no fat, no protein, no carbohydrate,
etc.) would be a useless exercise, especially in the case of the marketing of a single ingredient substance.'' The
comment requested that  101.36(f)(1) of the proposed rule be revised to either delete the nutrition labeling
requirement for small businesses or to allow the nutrition label to declare only those nutrients actually present
in the supplement. 
The agency believes that this comment misunderstood the proposed rule. As the comment requested, the agency requires
nutrition labeling ``only with respect to those substances actually contained in the supplement.'' Manufacturers
are not burdened with the cost of declaring that a vitamin supplement contains no fat, no protein, or no carbohydrate
if they do not. Only nutrients present in significant amounts are required to be declared under  101.36(b)(3).
Therefore, the agency is not changing the regulation in response to this comment. 
FDA notes that Congress recently passed, and the President signed on August 13, 1993, the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-80) that modified the treatment of small businesses. As a result of this change,
the exemption from nutrition labeling requirements for small businesses that are food manufacturers will be based
on the number of employees in a firm and the number of units of each product sold. FDA expects to publish a proposal to
amend   101.9 and 101.36 to reflect the new law.


F. Misbranding


43. One comment stated that  101.9(k)(1) through (k)(6) should not apply to dietary supplements. The comment
stated that  101.9(k)(1) is overbroad such that it suppresses truthful, nonmisleading speech about the beneficial
properties of a nutrient supplement product that may, by virtue of the supplement's inherent properties, not only
be a food but also aid in the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease. This comment did not focus on
why  101.9(k)(2) through (k)(6) should not apply to dietary supplements. Other comments specifically mentioned
that the first sentence of  101.9(k)(5) is vague, confusing, and contradictory. This sentence provides that
a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its label or labeling represents, suggests, or implies that the food has dietary
properties when such properties are of no significant value or need in human nutrition. These comments suggested
that this sentence be revised to read: ``A food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its label claims or represents that
the food has a significant value or need in human nutrition when the scientific evidence for the claim does not exist.''
These comments argued that this change is necessary because ``significant value or need in human nutrition'' is a
matter of consumer perception. They said that to a small child, the need for eating spinach is very low, but to the mother
the need for spinach is very high. Other comments specifically agreed that  101.9(k) should apply to dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals.
The agency does not agree with the comment that  101.9(k)(1) through (k)(6) should not apply to dietary supplements,
or that  101.9(k)(1) suppresses truthful, nonmisleading speech. The comment did not provide any basis for
the agency to conclude that this provision is not applicable to dietary supplements, or that it suppresses truthful,
nonmisleading speech. 
In the final rule on nutrition labeling of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2079 at 2167), the agency pointed out that the provisions
of  101.9(i) (redesignated as (k)) had long been in effect at the time Congress drafted the 1990 amendments.
While Congress did enact provisions under the 1990 amendments that allow for health claims on foods, nothing in the
act or in the legislative history of the act suggest that Congress intended that  101.9(i) should be changed.

Nor did the comments present any persuasive arguments that  101.9(k)(5) of the proposed rule should be amended.
The agency does not agree that whether or not a significant value or need in human nutrition has been established is
a matter of consumer perception. The agency notes that the phrase ``significant value or need in human nutrition''
was promulgated and published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 19, 1973 (38 FR 2125). In that final rule (38 FR 2125 at 2128), the agency explained that over the years there
have been a number of ingredients of products marketed as nutrients and nutritional supplements that have not been
shown to be essential in human nutrition, such as rutin, other bioflavonoids, para-aminobenzoic acid, and inositol.
The agency stated that calling attention to these ingredients in a manner that implies some nutritional benefit is
misleading. The agency concludes that the language of  101.9(k)(5) remains clear and does not need clarification.

Therefore, the agency is making no change in  101.9(b) in response to these comments. 


IV. Other Provisions


FDA did not receive any comments that dealt specifically with the other provisions of the proposal. In the absence
of any basis for doing otherwise, FDA is adopting those provisions as proposed. 


V. Economic Impact


In its dietary supplement labeling proposals of June 18, 1993, FDA stated that the proposed rules on the labeling of
dietary supplements, taken as a whole, would have associated costs of approximately $20 million. Thus, the agency
concluded that the proposed rules do not constitute a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291. In accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), FDA explored whether the proposed rules may have a significant
impact on small businesses and tentatively concluded that they do not.
FDA has evaluated the many comments that it received in response to its economic impact analysis. Because the issues
raised in the comments relate to all three proposals, FDA has combined its discussion of these comments and presented
them in the final rule regarding a delay in the date of application, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the


Federal Register

.
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules amending 21 CFR as required by Executive Order 12866
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the agency analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
FDA has concluded, based on its review of the available data and comments, that these final rules are not significant
as defined by Executive Order 12866. Further, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies
that these final rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.


VI. Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

4. Section 101.36 is added to subpart C to read as follows: 


 101.36 

Nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals.


(a) The label of a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral that has a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as established
in  101.9(c)(8)(iv) or a Daily Reference Value (DRV) as established in  101.9(c)(9), shall bear nutrition
labeling in accordance with this regulation, as illustrated in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, unless an exemption
is provided for the product in paragraph (f) of this section. Dietary supplements of herbs or other similar nutritional
substances shall bear nutrition labeling in accordance with  101.9.
(b) The declaration of nutrition information on the label and in labeling shall contain the following information,
using the headings and format specified, under the heading of ``Nutrition Facts''. The nutrition information shall
be enclosed in a box by use of lines, shall be all black or one color type, and shall be printed on a white or other neutral
contrasting background whenever practical.
(1) The subheading ``Serving Size'' shall be placed under the heading and aligned on the left side of the nutrition
label. The serving size shall be determined in accordance with  101.9(b) and  101.12(b), Table 2. Serving
size shall be expressed using a term that is appropriate for the form of the supplement, such as ``tablets,'' ``capsules,''
``packets,'' or ``teaspoonfuls.''
(2) The subheading ``Servings Per Container'' shall be placed under the subheading ``Serving Size'' and aligned
on the left side of the nutrition label, except that this information need not be provided when it is stated in the net
quantity of contents declaration. 
(3) A listing of all nutrients required in  101.9(c) that are present in the dietary supplement in quantitative
amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in  101.9(c). Those nutrients that are not
present, or that are present in amounts that would be declared as zero, shall not be declared. In addition, potassium,
vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, and selenium shall be declared, except when present
in quantitative amounts by weight that allow a declaration of zero. The name of each nutrient listed shall be immediately
followed by the quantitative amount by weight of the nutrient. Nutrient names and quantitative amounts shall be presented
in a column under the heading of ``Amount Per Serving'' and aligned on the left side of the nutrition label. The heading
``Amount Per Serving'' shall be separated from other information on the label by a bar above and beneath it, except
that when calories are listed, the bar shall be placed beneath the calorie declaration. When the serving size of the
product is one unit (e.g., one tablet), a heading consistent with the declaration of the serving size, such as ``Amount
Per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains,'' may be used in place of the heading ``Amount Per Serving.'' Other appropriate
terms, such as capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, may be used in place of the term ``Serving.''
(i) These amounts shall be expressed in the increments specified in  101.9(c), except that the amounts of vitamins
and minerals, excluding sodium and potassium, declared on the nutrition label shall be the actual amount of the vitamin
or mineral included in the dietary supplement, using the units of measure and the levels of significance given in  101.9(c).
In declaring the amounts of vitamins and minerals, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional
levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts
(e.g., the RDI for copper is given in whole milligrams (mg), but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of
a mg). Amounts for chloride, fluoride, and manganese shall be expressed in mg, and, amounts for chromium, molybdenum,
selenium, and vitamin K shall be expressed in micrograms. These values shall be expressed in whole numbers, except
that tenths may be used for fluoride. 
(ii) Nutrients that are present shall be listed in the order specified in  101.9(c); except that, when present,
vitamin K shall follow vitamin E; calcium and iron shall follow pantothenic acid; selenium shall follow zinc; and
manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium shall follow copper. This results
in the following order for vitamins and minerals: Vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin,
niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium,
zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium. A bar shall
separate the last nutrient to be listed from the bottom of the nutrition label, as shown in the sample labels in paragraph
(c)(9) of this section. 
(iii) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals (e.g.,
the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon),
the quantitative amounts may be presented as specified in this paragraph in individual nutrition labels or in one
aggregate nutrition label with separate columns declaring the quantitative amounts for each package as illustrated
in paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section. 
(iv) The percent of vitamin A that is present as 

beta

-carotene may be declared, to the nearest whole percent, immediately adjacent to or beneath the nutrient name (e.g.,
``Vitamin A 5000 IU (90 percent as 

beta

-carotene)''), except that the declaration is required when a claim is made about 

beta

-carotene. The amount of 

beta

-carotene in terms of international units (IU) may be included in parentheses following the percent statement (e.g.,
``Vitamin A 5000 IU (90 percent (4500 IU) as 

beta

-carotene)'').
(v) The following synonyms may be added in parenthesis immediately following the name of these nutrients: Vitamin
C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin), and calories (energy). Energy
content per serving may be expressed in kilojoules units, added in parentheses immediately following the statement
of caloric content. 
(vi) All nutrients shall be displayed with uniform type size, style, color, and prominence.
(4) A listing of the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., the percent of the RDI as established in  101.9(c)(8)(iv)
or DRV as established in  101.9(c)(9)), where appropriate, of all nutrients listed in the nutrition label,
except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in  101.9(c)(7) and no percent shall be given for
sugars, vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium. This information shall be presented
in one column aligned under the heading of
``% Daily Value'' and to the right of the column of nutrient names and amounts. The headings ``% Daily Value (DV),''
``% DV,'' ``Percent Daily Value,'' or ``Percent DV'' may be substituted for ``% Daily Value.'' The heading ``% Daily
Value'' shall be placed on the same line as the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' or placed beneath this heading and the
bar underneath it, except that ``% Daily Value'' shall be placed beneath this bar when calorie information is required
to be declared. Calorie information shall be placed beneath ``Amount Per Serving'' and above the bar. 
(i) The percent of Daily Value shall be calculated by dividing either the amount declared on the label for each nutrient
or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the RDI or DRV for the specified nutrient and multiplying
by 100, except that the percent for protein shall be calculated as specified in  101.9(c)(7)(ii). The numerical
value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).
(ii) The percentages based on RDI's and on DRV's shall be expressed to the nearest whole percent, except that ``Less
than 1%'' may be used in place of ``0%'' when the declaration of the quantitative amount by weight is a value greater
than zero.
(iii) The percent of Daily Value for vitamins and minerals shall be based on RDI values for adults and children 4 or more
years of age unless the product is represented or purported to be for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age,
pregnant women, or lactating women, in which case the column heading shall clearly state the intended group. If the
product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of daily value for each group shall be presented in separate
columns as shown in paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section. 
(iv) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals (e.g.,
the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon),
the percent of Daily Value may be presented as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section in individual nutrition
labels or in one aggregate nutrition label with separate columns declaring the percent of Daily Value for each package
as illustrated in paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section.
(v) If the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein,
the value shall be followed by an asterisk that refers to another asterisk at the bottom of the nutrition label that
states ``Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.''
(vi) When no percent is given for sugars, vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, or selenium,
an asterisk shall be placed in the ``% Daily Value'' column that shall refer to another asterisk that is placed at the
bottom of the nutrition label that is followed by the statement ``Daily Value not established.''
(c) Nutrition information specified in this section shall be presented as follows:
(1) The title of ``Nutrition Facts'' shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label
and, unless impractical, shall be set full width of the nutrition label. The title and all headings shall be highlighted
(reverse printing is not permitted as a form of highlighting) to distinguish them from other information. 
(2) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize a single easy-to-read type style.
(3) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize upper and lower case letters, except that all uppercase
lettering may be utilized for packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square
inches.
(4) All information within the nutrition label shall have at least one point leading (i.e., space between two lines
of text).
(5) Letters should never touch.
(6) All information within the nutrition label on packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling
of less than 12 square inches shall have type size no smaller than 4.5 point; packages that have from 12 to 40 square inches
of surface area available to bear labeling shall have type size no smaller than 6 point; and packages with more than
40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling shall have type size no smaller than 8 point, except that
on packages with more than 40 square inches of available surface area, type size no smaller than 6 point may be used for
the listing of information on 

beta

-carotene, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, for the headings required by paragraphs (b)(3)
and (b)(4) of this section (i.e., ``Amount Per Serving'' and ``% Daily Value''), and for the footnote required by paragraph
(b)(4)(v) of this section.
(7) A hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text shall separate each nutrient and its corresponding percent
Daily Value required in paragraph (b)(4) of this section from the nutrient and percent Daily Value above and beneath
it, as shown in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, and shall separate ``Amount Per Serving'' from the calorie statement,
when the listing of calories is required.
(8) In the interest of uniformity of presentation, FDA urges that the information be presented using the graphic specifications
set forth in Appendix B to Part 101, as applicable.
(9) The following sample labels are presented for the purpose of illustration:
(i) Multiple vitamin.











 (ii) Multiple vitamin for children and adults.









(iii) Multiple vitamins in packets.








(10) If space is not adequate to list the required information as shown in the sample labels in paragraph (c)(9) of this
section, the list may be split and continued to the right, as long as the headings are repeated. The list to the right
shall be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the nutrients and percent of Daily Value information
given to the left. The following sample label illustrates this display:







(d)(1) Compliance with this section shall be determined in accordance with  101.9(g)(1) through (g)(8).
(2) When it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply
with the requirements of this section, FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to
deal with the situation in accordance with  101.9(g)(9). Firms in need of such special allowances shall make
their request in writing to the Office of Food Labeling (HFS-150), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington,
DC 20204.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the location of nutrition information on a label shall be in
compliance with  101.2.
(f)(1) Dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals are exempt from this section when they are offered for sale by a
manufacturer, packer, or distributor who has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers that is
not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers of not more than $50,000,
Provided, That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information on a label or labeling or in advertising.
(2) For purposes of the paragraph, calculation of the amount of sales shall be based on the most recent 2-year average
of business activity. Where firms have been in business less than 2 years, reasonable estimates must indicate that
annual sales will not exceed the amounts specified. For foreign firms that ship foods into the United States, the business
activities to be included shall be the total amount of food sales, as well as other sales to consumers, by the firm in
the United States.
(g) Dietary supplements of vitamins and mineral shall be subject to the special labeling conditions specified in
 101.9(j)(5)(i) and (j)(5)(ii) for food, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to: (1) Include dietary supplements of vitamins,
minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances (hereinafter referred to as ``dietary supplements'')
under the coverage of the general principles for nutrient content claims; (2) provide for the use of expressed and
implied nutrient content claims on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements; and (3) provide for petitions for
nutrient content claims for dietary supplements. This final rule is in response to the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990 and to the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Regulatory History


On November 8, 1990, President Bush signed into law the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments)
(Pub. L. 101-535). The 1990 amendments revised the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number
of important ways. One of the most notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that they establish FDA's authority to
regulate nutrient content claims on food labels and in food labeling. Section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, which was added
by the 1990 amendments, provides that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim in its label or labeling that either
expressly or implicitly characterizes the level of any nutrient of the type required to be declared as part of nutrition
labeling, unless such claim has been specifically defined (or otherwise exempted) by regulation. The 1990 amendments
also direct the Secretary and, by delegation, FDA to promulgate regulations to define specific nutrient content
claims including ``free,'' ``low,'' ``light'' or ``lite,'' ``reduced,'' ``less,'' and ``high'' (section 3(b)(1)(A)(iii)
of the 1990 amendments).
In the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60421 and 56 FR 60478), FDA published two documents in which it proposed, among other things,
to define nutrient content claims, to provide for their use on foods labels, and to establish procedures for the submission
and review of petitions regarding the use of specific nutrient content claims. These proposals applied to dietary
supplements as well as foods in conventional food form. 
On October 6, 1992, the President signed the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992, Title II of Pub. L. 102-571 (the DS
act). Section 202(a)(1) of the DS act established a moratorium on the implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect
to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993. Section 202(a)(2)(A) required the Secretary, and by delegation
FDA, to issue proposed regulations on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements no later than June 15, 1993.

FDA issued final regulations that implemented the 1990 amendments with respect to nutrient content claims on foods
in conventional food form on January 6, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the ``final rule on nutrient content claims'')
(58 FR 2302). FDA modified these final regulations slightly in a document that made technical corrections to them
(58 FR 44020, August 18, 1993) (hereinafter referred to as ``the technical corrections document''). In response
to the requirements of the DS act, FDA published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33731) a proposal to: (1) Include dietary supplements under the coverage of the general principles
for nutrient content claims; (2) provide for the use of expressed and implied nutrient content claims on labels or
in labeling of dietary supplements; and (3) provide for petitions for nutrient content claims for dietary supplements
(hereinafter referred to as the ``proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements''). 
FDA received approximately 500 letters in response to its June 18, 1993, proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary
supplements. Each letter contained one or more comments. The letters were from a wide range of sources, including
consumers; consumer organizations; professional associations; Federal, State, and local government agencies;
industry; and industry trade associations. Many comments generally supported the proposal or various provisions
of the proposal. Other comments addressed issues outside the scope of the proposal (e.g., freedom of choice, access
to health care, access to dietary supplements) and will not be discussed here. Many comments suggested modifications,
revisions, or revocations of various aspects of the proposal. A summary of the comments, the agency's responses to
the comments, and a complete discussion of the agency's conclusions with respect to nutrient content claims for dietary
supplements follows. 


II. Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements_FDA Authority


1. A couple of comments contended that FDA lacks the statutory authority to prohibit claims for substances for which
no reference value (i.e., Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV)) has been established. The
comments also stated that the agency lacks legal authority to promulgate regulations governing products bearing
a nutrient content claim for a nutrient or other substance not explicitly named in section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2) of the
1990 amendments. The comments said that the references to section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2) of the act are references to
those nutrients that the 1990 amendments require to be listed (``mandatory nutrients'') on the nutrition label.
The comments argued that under these provisions, a food may be subject to a misbranding charge under section 403(r)(1)
of the act only if it characterizes, either explicitly or implicitly, the level of a mandatory nutrient in the food.

The comments also stated that the 1990 amendments did not provide FDA with misbranding authority over products that
bear a claim characterizing the level of a nutrient or other substance that is not listed in section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2)
of the act. The comments maintained that, regardless of whether a RDI or DRV has been established, no special requirements
should apply if a manufacturer of a substance not covered by section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2), such as garlic, wished to
claim that his product was ``high in garlic'' or a ``good source of garlic.'' The comments argued that while FDA maintains
its general misbranding authority over products bearing claims that characterize the level of a nonmandatory substance,
FDA still must meet its burden of proving that any such claims are actually ``false or misleading in any particular''
under the general misbranding provision, section 403(a)(1) of the act.
Section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act states that a food intended for human consumption is misbranded if it bears a claim
that expressly or by implication ``characterizes the level of any nutrient which is of the type required by paragraph
(q)(1) or (q)(2) to be in the label or labeling of the food * * *.'' The statute uses the same language in section 403(r)(1)(B)
to describe the substances that could be the subject of a health claim. A health claim is a claim that ``characterizes
the relationship of any nutrient which is of the type required by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2) to be in the label or labeling
of the food to a disease or a health-related condition       * * *.'' Under section
403(r)(1)(B), a health claim may be made in accordance with section 403(r)(5)(D) as well as section 403(r)(3). Thus,
because a statute must be read as a whole, the language in section 403(r)(1)(A) and (r)(1)(B) of the act that describes
the substances that may be the subject of a nutrient content or of a health claim must be read in conjunction with section
403(r)(5)(D), which addresses health claims for vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances
that are components of dietary supplements. Thus, the ``nutrients of the type required by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2)''
that are the subject of sections 403(r)(1)(A) and (r)(1)(B) of the act include vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other
similar nutritional substances. 
The legislative history of ``other nutritional substances'' reveals that its coverage is broad and could, in appropriate
circumstances, include garlic. See 136 Cong. Record S16609 (daily ed. October 24, 1990) (discussion between Senators
Metzenbaum and Symms). Therefore, while a label claim that a food contains garlic that is intended to describe the
taste of the food would not be subject to section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, a claim that describes the garlic content
in a way that reveals that garlic is being referred to as a nutritional substance would be subject to that section. Under
section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, the latter claim would misbrand the food unless its use has been authorized by FDA
under section 403(r)(2). Thus, FDA rejects the comments that disagreed with the proposed coverage of the nutrient
content claim provisions.
FDA has relied on the RDI's and DRV's in defining nutrient content claims under section 403(r)(2) of the act because
it has concluded that if the characterization of the level of a nutrient is to have any meaning, there must be a level
that can be used as a reference in determining whether the characterization is valid and appropriate. The RDI's and
DRV's provide such levels. Thus, in  101.54(a) (21 CFR 101.54(a)), FDA has limited the use of ``good source,''
``high,'' and ``more'' claims to use with nutrients for which an RDI or DRV has been established. FDA is not aware of
any other alternative standards.
If interested persons are aware of other standards that can be used as reference values to establish the validity of
content claims for substances for which RDI's and DRV's have not been established, those persons should make FDA aware
of those standards through  101.69 (21 CFR 101.69) or other appropriate means. FDA will carefully consider
using such standards as the basis for content claims for the substances involved.


III. Basis for Nutrient Content Claims For Dietary Supplements


A. Relationship to January 6, 1993 Final Rules, Consistency with Established Nutrient Content Claims, Scope


2. Many comments supported consistency in definitions for nutrient content claims between foods in conventional
food form and dietary supplements. However, one comment stated that consistency in definitions for nutrient content
claims for dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form is inappropriate. The comment argued that FDA
has chosen to define nutrient content claims that are not meaningful to the supplement industry and to consumers.

Many comments pointed out that dietary supplements are intended to contribute, with foods in conventional food form,
to consumers' daily nutrient intake. Thus, the comments argued that it is important that the terms used to describe
the levels of nutrients in both dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form be consistent. These comments
maintained that consumers would be confused if claims were to be allowed on dietary supplements that were not defined
in the same manner as those for foods in conventional food form.
FDA disagrees with the comments that said that consistency with established nutrient content claims is inappropriate
as a basic principle for defining nutrient content claims for dietary supplements. There is much about dietary supplements
that suggests that the principles that guide FDA in defining nutrient content claims for dietary supplements should
be the same as the principles that guide the agency in defining nutrient content claims on foods in conventional food
form. Dietary supplements that are not intended for use as drugs have traditionally been regulated as foods and, as
such, must be evaluated within the context of the total daily diet. In addition, nutrients from dietary supplements
serve the same physiological function as nutrients from foods in conventional food form. While some consumers seek
to ensure that the nutrient content of their diet is adequate through foods in conventional food form, other consumers
seek to ensure nutritional adequacy by making dietary supplements part of their diets (Ref. 1). Consistent use of
terms on dietary supplements and on foods in conventional food form will thus help consumers to construct a nutritionally
adequate total daily diet by allowing consumers to make meaningful comparisons among these products. It will also
facilitate use of these terms by consumers.
Over the years, FDA has stressed the importance of consistent definitions and descriptive terms as a necessary requirement
for effective education and for preventing misleading labeling (Ref. 2). If terms were given different definitions
depending on whether they were to be used to describe foods in conventional food form or dietary supplements, it would
make it much more difficult for the public to understand what these terms are intended to convey about a particular
food. Moreover, a single definition for a particular term eliminates any possibility that ambiguities could be created
by the use of that term. Therefore, the agency concludes that for nutrient content claims, the definition of a particular
term should be the same regardless of the type of food that it is being used to describe.
Additionally, FDA has been criticized for treating dietary supplements differently than other foods. FDA has no
desire to discriminate in any way against supplements. Thus, by having a single definition for a particular nutrient
content claim, FDA is providing the basis for dietary supplements to make the same claims as other foods and to be factored
into the diet like other foods. 
Nonetheless, as discussed in the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731), FDA recognizes
that dietary supplements differ in at least two respects from foods in conventional food form. First, dietary supplements
are likely to contain much higher levels of nutrients than foods in conventional food form. Thus, additional nutrient
content claims that are specific for dietary supplements may be appropriate. As discussed later in this document,
the agency intends in the near future to initiate a separate rulemaking to establish such claims for dietary supplements.
Second, dietary supplements generally do not contain several nutrients (e.g., fat, cholesterol) found in foods
in conventional food form. Therefore, in this document, FDA is limiting the use of certain claims that are useful for
describing foods in conventional food form but that do not meaningfully describe dietary supplements.


B. General Principles


1. Substitute Foods 


3. One comment objected to the requirement to use the word ``imitation'' on dietary supplements that are nutritionally
inferior to other products of the same type. The comment argued that FDA was never given the authority to decide on formulations
of dietary supplements, and that setting such formulations is the exclusive role of the manufacturer. Further, the
comment stated that there is nothing ``imitation'' about ``less'' in the supplement industry, and that a requirement
that a supplement be labeled ``imitation'' if it is nutritionally inferior to another product forces manufacturers
to increase potencies in order that their products will not have to be labeled ``imitation.'' 
Under section 403(r)(2)(A)(ii) of the act, for a food to be labeled as ``[nutrient] free,'' the nutrient must usually
be present in the food or in a food for which it substitutes, as that term is defined by the Secretary (and by delegation,
FDA) for the food. Accordingly, the agency defined ``substitute foods'' in  101.13(d) (21 CFR 101.3(d)) in
the final rule on nutrient content claims (58 FR 2302 at 2411) for the purpose of identifying the characteristics that
substitute foods must have if they are to bear nutrient content claims that highlight differences between them and
the foods for which they substitute. The definition states that a substitute food is one that may be used interchangeably
with another food that it resembles, i.e., to which it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including
shelf life) similar and to which it is not nutritionally inferior, unless it is labeled as an ``imitation.'' Additionally,
 101.3(e)(1) (21 CFR 101.3(e)(l)) states that a food shall be deemed to be an imitation, and thus subject to the
requirements of section 403(c) of the act, if it is a substitute for or resembles another food but is nutritionally
inferior to that food. Thus, the issue that the agency must consider is whether dietary supplements that are foods
should be subject to these provisions on substitute foods as any other foods are. 
The agency has no evidence that manufacturers will increase the potencies for their products to avoid the use of this
term and disagrees that this provision will interfere with a manufacturer's right to decide on product formulations.
It is extremely unlikely that the term ``imitation'' will ever be used on dietary supplements, particularly dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals. The issue of whether a supplement would be an ``imitation'' would arise only
when a manufacturer chooses to make a ``free'' or ``low'' claim for sugar or sodium on a dietary supplement (see comment
4). In such circumstances, under section 403(r)(2)(A)(ii) of the act, the manufacturer must identify a product on
the market with which its product can be used interchangeably, to which the manufacturers product is not nutritionally
inferior, and that contains sodium or sugar. Such a product may include the version of the manufacturer's product
that contains sodium or sugar. As long as such a product exists, the manufacturer's product need not be labeled as an
imitation. Moreover, if because of the way the manufacturer has formulated its product, there is no product with which
it is used interchangeably, the product can be called ``______, a sodium-free food.'' Only in the rare situations
in which neither of the conditions apply would the product have to be called ``imitation'' for it to bear a ``free''
or ``low'' sodium or sugar claim.
Sections 101.13(d)(1) and (d)(2) are designed to ensure that material differences between the substitute food and
the reference food are conspicuously stated on the label or labeling of the food, so that consumers can make fully informed
judgments about the value of the substitute food and its usefulness in maintaining healthy dietary practices. If
a product has substantially less of a nutrient than the reference food, and to that extent is materially different
and inferior in nutrient content, then ``imitation'' is an entirely appropriate term. For this reason, the agency
concludes that there is no reason to apply the substitute food provisions any differently to dietary supplements
than to other foods.


2. Requirements for ``Low'' and ``Free'' Claims


4. Several comments from dietary supplement manufacturers and trade associations questioned the need to allow ``low''
and ``free'' claims for nutrients such as fat and cholesterol that are not typically found in dietary supplements.
One comment suggested that ``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims for calories, fat, and cholesterol on dietary
supplements should be permitted only on dietary supplements that are a significant source of calories, such as protein
supplements. The comment argued that consumers do not expect most dietary supplements to contain significant amounts
of calories, and that it is nonsensical and confusing to permit dietary supplements that are not a significant source
of calories to make a claim about reduced amounts of calories, fat, and cholesterol contained therein. Another comment
stated that Americans who consume dietary supplements do not do so because the products are ``low in fat,'' ``cholesterol
free,'' or ``low calorie,'' and that consumers are not interested in the fat content of dietary supplements. The comment
argued that consumers care about the substances in the products and the benefits that those products can have for their
health. 
In the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, the agency requested comment on the need for extending
``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims to dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33745). The agency has reviewed
the comments that it received and is persuaded by them that it not meaningful to allow claims about the calorie, fat
(including saturated fat), or cholesterol content of most dietary supplements. Most of these products do not contain
those nutrients, and most consumers do not expect that they do. Thus, consumers would not generally look to these products
in making dietary choices that are designed to control the amount of calories, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol
in the foods they eat. In fact, claims about these nutrients in most dietary supplements would only serve to confuse
consumers. While it is true that FDA is requiring information about these nutrients in the nutrition label of supplements
of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances, this requirement derives mainly from the limitation on the
exemption in section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act (formerly section 403(q)(5)(E)). See the final rule on general requirements
for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
However, the agency recognizes that there are some dietary supplements, such as protein supplements, in which the
amount of calories in the product is significant to consumers. On these products, the source of the calories, particularly
whether they are from fat, is relevant and useful information.
Therefore, FDA has decided, based on the comments that it received to only allow calorie, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol
claims on those dietary supplements in which the amount of calories is important to consumers. In attempting to define
what this level of calories should be, the agency looked first to  101.9(f)(1) and (j)(4), which said that a food
has ``insignificant'' calories for the purposes of nutrition labeling if it has an amount of calories that can be rounded
to zero. Section 101.9(c)(1) states that ``less than 5 calories'' per serving may be expressed as zero, the same amount
that is defined as ``calorie free.'' 
While FDA does not have information on the caloric content of dietary supplements, it would not be unreasonable to
expect that many dietary supplements contain more than 5 calories (cal) per serving, particularly children's chewable
vitamin and mineral supplements, supplements that contain herbal extracts, and supplements that contain caloric
binders and fillers. Thus, to tie the use of ``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' calorie, fat, and cholesterol claims
on labels of dietary supplements to the presence of more than an ``insignificant amount'' of calories in the food would
be over-inclusive and would allow many products in which the amount of calories is not significant to consumers to
bear such claims.
FDA next looked at the definition of ``low calorie'' in  101.60(b)(2) (21 CFR 101.60(b)(2)) for use in determining
which dietary supplements should be allowed to bear ``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims. Section 101.60(b)(2)
defines a ``low calorie'' food as a food that contains 40 cal or less per reference amount customarily consumed (hereinafter
referred to as reference amount) and per 50 grams (g) if the reference amount is small. FDA believes that 40 cal per reference
amount represents a reasonable level for demarcating a dietetically relevant source of calories for dietary supplements.
In a product that contains this amount of calories, the source of the calories (e.g., fat) is of significance to consumers.

Accordingly, the agency is revising  101.62(a) (21 CFR 101.62(a)) by adding paragraph (a)(4) to state that
``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims for fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may not be made for dietary supplements
that meet the criteria in  101.60(b)(1) and (b)(2) for ``calorie free'' and ``low calorie'' claims. FDA is also
revising  101.13(b) by adding new paragraph (b)(5) to reflect these provisions. As a consequence, claims that
identify all products of that class of being ``low'' or ``free'' of a nutrient (e.g., ``vitamin C supplement, a fat-free
supplement'') will also be prohibited. 
However, to use the same criteria (i.e., that a product may not be ``calorie free'' or ``low calorie'') as a basis for
when a calorie claim may be made, has the effect of prohibiting the very claims that the criterion seeks to permit, namely
``calorie free'' and ``low calorie'' claims. Such a criterion would permit only relative calorie claims (e.g. ``reduced'')
on dietary supplements. Therefore, a slightly different scheme for permitting calorie claims on certain dietary
supplements, such as protein supplements, must be derived.
While, as stated above, the agency believes that calorie claims should not be permitted on most dietary supplements,
it does believe that ``calorie free'' and ``low calorie'' claims may be appropriate if an equivalent amount of a similar
food (i.e., another protein supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes would normally
contain an appreciable amount of calories. Such a claim would highlight that the labeled food had a different calorie
profile than would be expected in the similar product. It would also serve to direct a consumer to a product that had
a lower amount of calories. Because the food would meet the criteria for ``low calorie'' and would be so labeled, it
would not be necessary to highlight any comparative differences between the labeled and the similar food as would
be required for a relative claim.
Therefore, the agency is revising  101.62(a) by adding new paragraph (a)(4) to state that claims for calories
may not be made on labels of dietary supplements that meet the criteria in  101.60(b)(1) or (b)(2) for ``calorie
free'' and ``low calorie'' except when an equivalent amount of a similar dietary supplement (e.g., another protein
supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes normally exceeds the definition for ``low
calorie'' in  101.60(b)(2). It is including similar language in  101.13(b)(5). 
The comments specifically objected to claims for calories, fat, and cholesterol. Claims for sodium and sugar content
were not mentioned. Since the sugar and sodium levels in dietary supplements can vary substantially, the agency finds
that claims about the sugar and sodium content of dietary supplements may be useful in helping consumers to make purchasing
decisions that will assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Thus, extending the definitions of ``low,''
``free,'' and ``reduced'' for sugar and sodium to dietary supplements is appropriate irrespective of the calorie
level of the dietary supplement. Therefore, FDA concludes that there is no need to place limitations on claims for
sugar and sodium content other than those in    101.60(c) and 101.61, respectively. As explained below,
FDA is amending these provisions to reflect their application to dietary supplements.


3. Labeling Mechanics
a. Type size 


5. In discussing type size for nutrient content claims, one comment stated that every new statement that is required
on dietary supplement labels will create a problem for manufacturers, particularly if they are constrained by minimum-type
size requirements. 
The agency acknowledges that dietary supplements are frequently packaged in small containers, and for this reason,
FDA specifically asked for information on the impact of the type size proposal on dietary supplements that are packaged
in small containers (58 FR 33731 at 33734). No suggestions or examples were presented to assist the agency in deciding
how to address this problem. Therefore, the agency has made no special provision for dietary supplements in the type
size requirements for nutrient content claims. FDA discusses the type size requirements for the nutrition labeling
of dietary supplements in the final rule on nutrition labeling of dietary supplements published elsewhere in this
issue of the 

Federal Register

.
FDA stated in the technical corrections document (58 FR 44020 at 44020 and 44021) that there was a need to specify the
minimum type size for labeling information (e.g., accompanying information) required under the nutrient content
claims regulation. As a result, the agency modified  101.2(b) to include   101.13, 101.54, 101.56,
101.60, 101.61, 101.62, and 101.65 in the list of sections set out in  101.2(b) for which a minimum type size for
required label information is specified. For consistency, the agency also modified  101.2(f) to include   101.13,
101.54, 101.56, 101.60, 101.61, 101.62, and 101.65.The effect of these revisions for dietary supplements is that
label information required by the nutrient content claims regulations, but whose type size is not otherwise specified,
will be required to be in letters or numbers no less than one-sixteenth of an inch in height unless otherwise specified
by  101.2(c). FDA believes that making nutrient content claims on dietary supplements subject to this requirement
is appropriate because this requirement is the logical outgrowth of the proposal. In the proposal on nutrient content
claims for dietary supplements, FDA raised the issue of how to make nutrient content claims on dietary supplements.
The question of how to ensure the legibility of the referral statement, which is required by section 403(r)(2)(B)
of the act, is one that is at least implicitly raised by this issue. Thus, the agency's decision to explicitly address
the question of the type size of the referral statement in this final rule represents the logical outgrowth of issues
that were raised in the proposal. 
The agency pointed out in the technical corrections document that if there are circumstances in which the product
is not able to comply with type size requirements, manufacturers may request an alternative means of compliance (e.g.,
permission to use a reduced type size) in accordance with   101.9(g)(9). Section 101.9(g)(9) states that when
it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with nutrition
labeling requirements, they may write to the Office of Food Labeling, Food and Drug Administration, and request an
alternative means of compliance. For the reasons explained above, dietary supplements of herbs and other similar
nutritional substances are appropriately subject to this provision even though it was not specifically set out in
the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements. A similar provision is included in  101.36(d)(2)
of the final regulation for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, in a companion document
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

. These provisions allow flexibility to ensure that there will be either sufficient space to make nutrient content
claims on the labels of dietary supplements, or that manufacturers will have recourse to request relief.


b. Disclosure levels


6. One comment stated that there are a certain number of products, such as chewable tablets containing sodium ascorbate,
for which information on sodium might be useful to consumers in maintaining healthy diets. The comment suggested
that the agency urge supplement manufacturers to include information on sodium content, even though the sodium level
might not reach the threshold levels established in  101.13(h)(1) that would trigger a required statement.
The agency disagrees that there is a sufficient basis for requiring either the declaration of total sodium content
on the principal display panel of a dietary supplement or for requiring a referral statement directing the consumer
to the nutrition label for information about sodium content on all dietary supplements. Section 101.13(h)(1) specifies
that the referral statement (i.e., ``See [appropriate panel] for information about [nutrient requiring disclosure]
and other nutrients'') is required only when the sodium (or fat, saturated fat, or cholesterol) content of a product
exceeds the disclosure level. FDA finds that there is no reason to provide a different rule for dietary supplements.
To the extent, as the comment suggests, that information on sodium content would be useful, it will be provided on the
nutrition label as long as it is present at more than an insignificant level. Section 101.36(b)(3), which lists the
nutrients that must be included in the nutrition label of a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral, provides that
all nutrients listed in  101.9(c), including sodium, must be declared on the nutrition label of a dietary supplement
of vitamins and minerals, except that nutrients present at levels that would be declared as zero shall not be declared.
(For sodium, the amount that is declared as zero is less than 5 milligrams (mg) per serving.) Section 101.9(c) itself
requires that sodium be listed on the nutrition label of other dietary supplements. Consumers thus will be able to
readily find the amount of sodium in a product by examining the nutrition label. Because the comment provided no basis
for its suggestion other than usefulness, FDA is not making any special provision for the declaration of sodium on
dietary supplements.


4. Relative Claims, Reference Foods, ``Modified''


7. One comment requested that the agency clarify in  101.13(j) that for dietary supplements, the reference
food may be a source of the nutrient in either a dissimilar food within a product category or a similar food. The comment
stated that the most helpful information to a consumer purchasing a dietary supplement often may be a comparison of
the vitamin or mineral content to a recognized source of the nutrient, e.g., ``contains more vitamin C than two 8 oz
glasses of orange juice.'' In addition, the comment maintained that the examples used in the proposed rule on nutrient
content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33737) for comparing dissimilar foods within the same product
category (e.g., potato chips as a reference for pretzels) generally does not apply to dietary supplements. 
The agency agrees that a clarification is warranted to reinforce that  101.13(j) applies to dietary supplements
as well as to foods in conventional food form. Section 101.13(j)(1)(i)(A) states that for ``less'' (or ``fewer'')
and ``more'' claims, the reference food may be a dissimilar food within a product category that can generally be substituted
for one another in the diet (e.g., potato chips as reference for pretzels) or a similar food (e.g., potato chips as reference
for potato chips). 
The agency agrees that adding examples that are specific for dietary supplements will clarify that for ``less'' (or
``fewer'') and ``more'' claims, the reference food may be a dissimilar food within a product category for which the
labeled food can generally be substituted (e.g., orange juice as a reference for vitamin C tablet) or a similar food
(e.g., one brand of multivitamin as a reference for another brand of multivitamin). Accordingly, the agency is revising
 101.13(j)(1)(i)(A) to include these examples.
Additionally, to clarify  101.13(j)(1)(i)(B) for ``light,'' ``reduced,'' ``added,'' ``fortified,'' and
``enriched'' claims, the agency is revising this regulation to include an example of a reference food that is a similar
food (e.g., one brand of multivitamin for another brand of multivitamin).
8. One comment agreed that the term ``modified'' would rarely be a useful term for vitamin/mineral supplements but
stated that this term might be useful for certain dietary supplements that contain ``other similar nutritional substances.''
The comment stated that there are techniques for concentrating certain fish oils that are high in omega-3 fatty acids.
The comment suggested that the use of the term ``modified'' might serve to distinguish products containing the concentrated
fish oils from other fish oil products that would have to be taken several times a day to provide the same amount of fish
oil and thus result in the consumption of significantly more calories. The comment argued that use of the term ``modified''
on dietary supplements should be authorized to maintain the principle of consistency between foods in conventional
food form and dietary supplements.
The agency agrees. FDA has defined ``modified'' for use as part of the statement of identity on foods to reflect the
fact that a change has been made in a food (56 FR 60421 at 60454). The term is not to be used alone, nor is the term to be used
to describe products that have not been altered (58 FR 2302 at 2367 and 2412). Based on the comment, the agency concludes
that this term may have some limited usefulness for dietary supplements, and thus this term may be used on such products
when they meet the conditions of  101.13(k). FDA finds, however, that no change in  101.13(k) is necessary
to authorize this use of the term.


5. Reference Amounts 


9. One comment stated that if comparative claims (e.g., ``reduced sodium'') were to be made for dietary supplements,
there need to be reference amounts (i.e., reference amounts customarily consumed) established so that one product
recommending consumption of, for example, one tablespoon (tbsp) per day is not compared to a product recommending
five tbsp per day. The comment argued that the proposal allows very flexible reference amounts for supplements (i.e.,
whatever the manufacturer is recommending for consumption) and suggests that reference amounts of reference foods
(as established in  101.13(j)) be specified in more concrete terms.
The agency is not persuaded by the comment that more concrete terms are needed for reference amounts at this time. The
agency has established in the final rule on general requirements for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements
published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 a definition for the reference amount customarily consumed for dietary supplements in  101.12(b) as ``the
maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion or, in the absence of recommendations,
1 tablet, capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, as appropriate.'' This definition is based on comments received on the
proposal for mandatory nutrition labeling for dietary supplements.
Section 101.13(p)(1), which FDA proposed to apply to dietary supplements, states that unless otherwise specified,
the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in  101.12(b) through (f) shall be used in determining
whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. The comment did not suggest an alternative to the
reference amount that could be used as the basis for comparative claims for dietary supplements. Therefore, given
the fact, as the agency said in the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33732),
that a consistent approach to nutrient content claims on dietary supplements and on foods in conventional food form
will increase consumers' ability to use and understand such claims, FDA is not adopting a different approach to comparative
claims for dietary supplements than the one that it adopted for foods in conventional food form.
The agency acknowledges that there is a potential for unfair marketing and misleading claims if the serving size is
manipulated upwards or downwards to enable a product to make a nutrient content claim. The agency retains the authority
to regulate any such misleading claims under section 403(a) of the act. Issues concerning serving size are further
discussed in the companion document on nutrition labeling for dietary supplements, published elsewhere in this
issue of the 

Federal Register

.


IV. Definitions for Specific Nutrient Content Claim Terms


A. Use of RDI's and DRV's in Formulating Definitions


10. Many comments stated that limiting nutrient content claims to those nutrients with RDI's or DRV's was unnecessarily
restrictive. Several comments suggested that content claims should be authorized with respect to a nutrient as long
as it has either an RDI or DRV as established by FDA in  101.9(c) or a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) as established
by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (Ref. 4). Other comments also stated that nutrient content claims should
be authorized for nutrients for which NAS has established Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI's).
Other comments suggested that FDA should expand the number of vitamins and minerals with RDI's when it publishes the
final RDI/DRV rule following the expiration of the DS act moratorium. 
FDA agrees that the current list of RDI's does not represent the entire list of nutrients for which dietary recommendations
have been established. The agency had proposed to establish RDI's for all nutrients for which RDA's or ESADDI's were
provided in the 1989 edition of the NAS RDA's (56 FR 60366). However, under the DS act, the agency was constrained to
retain the label reference values established in  101.9(c)(8)(iv) until at least November 8, 1993. These values
were based on the 1968 RDA's. The 1968 RDA's did not contain recommended dietary values for a number of nutrients for
which NAS has subsequently provided RDA's or ESADDI's. RDA's for vitamin K and selenium were established subsequent
to 1968 and are listed in the 1989 edition of the NAS RDA's (Ref. 4). Furthermore, the 1980 and 1989 editions of the NAS
RDA's provided ESADDI's for chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum. Now that the moratorium established
by the DS act has expired, the agency is proposing elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 to establish RDI's for all nutrients for which RDA's or ESADDI's are provided in the 1980 and 1989 editions of the NAS's
Recommended Dietary Allowances but for which RDI's or DRV's have not been established by FDA. Once RDI's are established
for these additional seven nutrients, nutrient content claims may be made for them. 
FDA intends to consider revising all of the RDI's to conform to the most recent levels established by NAS. However,
FDA is aware that NAS is in the process of reevaluating the basis on which RDA's are determined. It is considering the
issue of whether values should be selected to prevent deficiencies or to promote optimal wellness. The agency believes
that its action should await completion of the NAS process. FDA is committed to working with NAS to help resolve this
issue.
Accordingly, as stated in response to comment number 1 above, FDA has concluded that it is not possible to define nutrient
content claims for nutrients for which no reliable reference standards such as the RDI's and DRV's have been established.
The agency believes that authorization for nutrient content claims for nutrients for which no RDI or DRV exists (e.g.,
vitamin K) needs to be deferred until RDI's or DRV's are adopted. In the interim, quantitative nutrient information
may be listed in the nutrition label as discussed in the final rule on general requirements for nutrition labeling
for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

. 
Also, manufacturers may provide amount or percentage statements as described in  101.13(i)(3) for those nutrients
that do not have RDI's or DRV's. For example, while there is no RDI for fluoride, under this provision, manufacturers
may declare the amount of the nutrient present (e.g., 2 mg fluoride) on any panel outside of the Nutrition Facts box.

11. One comment stated that claims should be permitted for 

beta

-carotene.
The agency believes that claims regarding 

beta

-carotene (e.g., ``contains 

beta

-carotene'') are claims about an ingredient that make implied representations about the level of vitamin A that is
present in the food as 

beta

-carotene. This conclusion is consistent with section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, which states that a food can be misbranded
by a statement that expressly or by implication characterizes the level of a nutrient in a food. The agency considers
that the claim ``contains 

beta

-carotene'' implies that there is enough 

beta

-carotene in the food to constitute a ``good source'' of vitamin A (i.e., it contains 10 percent or more of the DV for
vitamin A from 

beta

-carotene). Such a claim is provided for in  101.65(c).
12. One comment advocated defining nutrient content claims for ultratrace nutrients including boron, silicon,
vanadium, arsenic, and tin. The comment stated that claims about these ultratrace elements should be permitted on
the basis of the RDA, ESADDI, or the amounts found in the average well-balanced diet. Additionally, this comment argued
that reference values should be available for ultratrace nutrients once reputable scientific evidence is established
that such nutrients serve important metabolic or physiological functions in the body. The comment also suggested
that label information be permitted for choline and inositol.
The agency disagrees. The trace elements arsenic, nickel, silicon, boron, cadmium, lead, lithium, tin, vanadium,
and cobalt, as well as choline and inositol, have not been shown to be essential in humans. No RDA's or ESADDI's for these
substances have been established by NAS. NAS states that several of these substances ``naturally present in foods
are known to be required in the diets of various animal or microbial species, but there is little or no evidence of their
dietary essentiality for humans'' (Ref. 4). While NAS acknowledges that some of these classes of substances may ``one
day be candidates for RDA's,'' it states that there is currently no evidence that these substances are essential in
humans (Ref. 4). 
As stated in the ``Summary'' section of the 10th edition of the NAS RDA publication (Ref. 4), the NAS RDA's are based
not only on data from nutrient intake measurements but also on information from nutrient balance studies, experimental
intake studies, biochemical measurements, epidemiological observations of nutrient status, and extrapolation
of data from animal experiments. FDA does not agree with the comments that it is desirable to base label reference values
for nutrient content claims solely on individual scientific research publications, no matter how current, or solely
on data on amounts of the trace element found in well-balanced diets. The existence of such data does not mean that there
is scientific agreement on the essentiality of the nutrient or on the recommended level in the diet. Should agreement
on the essentiality of additional nutrients be reached, timely and appropriate changes to the label reference values
can be made through FDA's rulemaking procedures.
However, as stated above, manufacturers are free to declare the amount of the trace elements, or choline or inositol,
on the product label outside of the ``Nutrition Facts'' panel in accordance with  101.13(i)(3). Such a statement
of amount is not considered to characterize the level of the nutrient in the food, as would claims such as ``high'' or
``more.''
13. One comment stated that although no RDI's have been established for certain vitamins and minerals, nutrient content
claims could be based on reference foods that are recognized sources of those nutrients. For example, the label could
state that ``Brand X provides more vitamin K than two servings of cabbage,'' based on the vitamin K content of the reference
amount for vegetables without sauce listed in  101.12, Table 2. 
The agency disagrees. Until a reference standard is established there is no basis for confidence that cabbage is a
good source of vitamin K. There is also no basis for confidence that the amount of vitamin K in the food that is to be the
subject of the claim is nutritionally significant. Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the agency has proposed to expand the list of nutrients with RDI's, including vitamin K. At this time, however, FDA
concludes that it would be premature to authorize such claims.


B. Specific Requirements for Nutrient Content Claims (21 CFR 101, Subpart D)_Applicability to Dietary Supplements


1.  101.54 Nutrient Content Claims for ``Good Source,'' ``high,'' and ``More'' 
a. ``Good source'' and ``high'' 


14. One comment encouraged the agency to maintain the proposed definitions for ``good source'' and ``high'' for dietary
supplements. The comment argued that a higher level (e.g., 40 percent of the RDI) would suggest to consumers that daily
nutrient intakes could be achieved by consuming only a few foods, which is inconsistent with dietary guidelines.
The comment maintained that if a new higher claim level was adopted for supplements, it would likely also apply to foods
in conventional food form based on the logic of the proposal for nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (i.e.,
consistency in definitions). The comment stated that users of dietary supplements are well aware of the elevated
nutrient levels in these products, and that a new paradigm is not needed to inform consumers of these levels. 
On the other hand, several comments did not support the proposal to use the same definitions for ``good source'' and
``high'' claims as those used for foods in conventional food form. The comments argued that the terms ``good source''
and ``high'' should not carry the same meaning for supplements as for foods in conventional food form, that most supplements
contain at least 100 percent of the Daily Value for most of the nutrients they provide, and that consumers expect most
of these products to contain at least 100 percent of the Daily Value. The comments maintained that allowing any product
with as little as 10 or 20 percent of the RDI to carry ``good source'' and ``high'' claims would confuse and mislead consumers.

One comment questioned whether it is appropriate to permit the use of these nutrient content claims on vitamins and
mineral supplements since it implies that supplements are comparable to, and acceptable substitutes for, foods
in conventional food form. The comment also noted that nutrition educators feel strongly that supplements can enhance
the nutrient intake from foods in conventional food form but can never replace them since foods in conventional food
form provides other important components. On the other hand, many comments supported the proposal to extend the same
definitions for ``good source'' and ``high'' for foods in conventional food form to dietary supplements. These comments
emphasized the importance of consistency in definitions to assist consumer education.
One comment requested clarification on whether the terms ``good source'' and ``contains'' will be permitted for
dietary supplements. The comment maintained that such claims provide consumers with important information regarding
the precise content of various nutrients and should not be subject to discriminatory treatment solely on the basis
of whether such claims are made for a nutrient in a dietary supplement as opposed to one in a conventional food.
The agency has reviewed these comments and is not persuaded that the definition of the terms ``good source'' and ``high''
should be different for dietary supplements than for foods in conventional food form. The agency finds that the definitions
for foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements should be consistent. As directed by the 1990 amendments
(section 3(b)(1)(A)(iii)(VI)), FDA defined the term ``high,'' and the synonyms ``rich in'' and ``excellent source
of,'' for use on labels and in labeling in  101.54 (58 FR 2302 at 2344). In  101.54(c)(1) of final rule on
nutrient content claims, the agency stated that the term ``good source'' may be used to describe a food when a serving
of the food contains 10 to 19 percent of the RDI or the DRV for a nutrient. Likewise, the agency stated that the term ``high''
may be used to describe a food when a serving contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or the DRV. FDA concluded that the use
of these terms would permit a sufficient number of food items to bear ``good source'' and ``high'' claims to allow consumers
to use the claims in selecting foods that are better sources of nutrients (58 FR 2344). 
While FDA recognizes that under the present definitions, most, if not all, dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
potassium, and fiber would qualify for ``good source'' or ``high'' claims, the agency does not agree with those comments
that argued that the definitions, as proposed, would be confusing or misleading to consumers. As suggested by the
IOM report on nutrition labeling (Ref. 6), the use of consistent and targeted content claims increases consumers'
confidence in the validity of the claim. FDA is aware of no evidence to support an alternate conclusion. The basic principle
of consistency in definitions of nutrient content claims is discussed in detail in comment 2 of this document. 
Furthermore, the agency recognizes that consumers expect dietary supplements to be concentrated sources of nutrients.
Consumer studies support this conclusion (Refs. 1 and 5). FDA acknowledges that the terms ``good source'' and ``high''
might be of limited utility in comparing nutrient content among dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals because
virtually the entire class of products would qualify for such claims. However, these terms may be useful for some single
source dietary supplements of calcium, biotin, or fiber or for multinutrient preparations containing these nutrients.
These nutrients are generally found in dietary supplements at levels below the Daily Value. 
Additionally, FDA believes that these terms would be useful in highlighting the nutrient content of some herbs and
other similar nutritional substances that have nutrients at levels high enough to qualify for the definition of one
of the above terms. For these reasons, the agency is not persuaded to preclude the use of these terms for dietary supplements.

The agency agrees with the comment that stated that dietary supplements cannot replace foods in conventional food
form in all respects because the latter foods supply other important components. However, FDA recognizes that dietary
supplements can be a useful part of the diet for those who wish to make sure that they consume at least the RDI amount for
all vitamins and minerals or for those who wish to increase their daily intake of a particular substance above those
levels that are ordinarily available from conventional foods. Thus, FDA finds that use of these terms on dietary supplements
is appropriate.
FDA is convinced that consistency in definitions of nutrient content claims across the food supply is necessary.
Consistency facilitates consumer education by limiting the number of terms that the public must learn and interpret.
Moreover, different definitions for the same terms for dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form would
be confusing to consumers because of the difficulties inherent in learning alternate definitions for the same term.
There is a greater chance of error and misinterpretation when several definitions must be learned for the same term.
Thus, different definitions would likely do more harm than good. Accordingly, the agency concludes that the proposed
definitions for ``good source'' and ``high'' are appropriate, and that there is no reason to define the terms differently
for dietary supplements. 
The agency would like to clarify that ``good source'' and ``contains'' as defined  101.54(c)(1) are nutrient
content claims that can be used for foods in conventional food form as well as for dietary supplements. There is nothing
in this final rule that states that the use of these terms would not be allowed for dietary supplements.
15. One comment stated that under FDA's proposal, consumers who want truly high levels_that is, levels that exceed
the RDI_would have no means of identifying those products, other than reading the fine print on the back of each supplement
label. 
The comment acknowledged that consumers might also be confused if ``high'' had one meaning when the claim appears
on labels of dietary supplements and a different meaning when the claim appears on labels of foods in conventional
food form. To avoid that inconsistency, the comment urged FDA to prohibit the claims ``good source'' and ``high''
on supplements. Further, the comment suggested that the agency should define the term ``high potency'' and allow
it to be used only on supplements. 
FDA disagrees that the terms ``good source'' and ``high'' should be prohibited on the labels of dietary supplements.
The agency recognizes that a claim of ``high'' will not specifically identify those products that have levels of nutrients
that exceed the RDI. However, the quantitative amount of a nutrient in a dietary supplement is often a part of the statement
of identity for the product, and additional quantitative information regarding the level of a nutrient may also be
found in amount or percentage statements on the principal display panel. In addition, as a result of the agency's new
format requirements, the nutrition label for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals provides quantitative
information on the levels of specific nutrients as well as the percent DV for each nutrient in a more legible format.
Consequently, consumers will have easy access to information regarding the levels of specific nutrients and may
adjust their levels of intake accordingly.
Further, as discussed in the previous comment, while the terms ``good source'' and ``high'' may be of limited utility
for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, these terms may be useful in highlighting the nutritional content
of single nutrients, such as biotin and calcium, that are generally found in products at levels well below the RDI,
as well as of dietary supplements of herbs and other similar nutritional products. Therefore, FDA concludes that
precluding the use of these terms on dietary supplements is unjustified. 
However, FDA believes that there is a sufficient basis to consider defining the term ``high potency'' or some similar
term as a nutrient content claim. FDA's tentative view is that this term, or a similar term when defined, could provide
a way for manufacturers to describe the higher levels of nutrients in dietary supplements. (See comment 25 for further
discussion of this matter.) 


b. ``More'' 


16. One comment stated that consumers could be misled if comparative claims are made among high potency vitamin/mineral
supplements. The comment stated that if, for example, one brand of 300-mg vitamin B6 tablets claimed that it contained
``more'' than a competitive 250-mg product, then the consumer may get the misleading impression that the former product
is better. The comment maintained that as customers shop for supplements, they will be able to readily observe whether
one product is more potent than another without label claims suggesting superiority of one over another. If such a
claim resulted in better sales, then a ``horsepower race'' would ensue. The comment recommended that ``more'' claims
for vitamins and minerals not be allowed if the nutrient potency of the reference product already meets or exceeds
100 percent of the Daily Value. 
The agency acknowledges that there is the possibility that some manufacturers may choose to increase potencies in
order to make a ``more'' claim in comparison to another brand, but the agency disagrees that the limitation suggested
by the comment is warranted at this time. The agency points out that ``more'' claims for nutrients with an RDI or DRV,
including those products with nutrients in megadoses, such as those in the example cited by the comment, must include
the following information: The percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient was increased relative to the RDI or DRV,
the identity of the reference food, and the quantitative amount of the nutrient present (e.g., contains ``20 percent
more of the DV for vitamin B6 per tablet than product `x'. The vitamin B6 content of product `x' is 250 mg. This product
contains 300 mg vitamin B6.'') The nutrition label of a product containing 300 mg of vitamin B6 must state that the product
contains 1,500 percent of the Daily Value. The agency acknowledges that the amount of information required to make
a ``more'' claim is considerable, but such information is necessary to allow consumers to readily see how the amount
of a nutrient for which a ``more'' claim is made fits into the total daily diet. Furthermore, FDA believes that the concern
regarding ``horsepower races'' in dietary supplements stems from concerns of possible unfair marketing among manufacturers
as well as from safety concerns inherent in the addition of very high levels of nutrients to supplements. Similar concerns
with foods in conventional food form led to the establishment of FDA's fortification policy in 1980. This policy,
while published in  104.20, does not have the force of a regulation. However, the agency has not found evidence
of widespread ``horsepower races'' with such foods. The agency urges industry, particularly industry associations,
to develop standards regarding nutrient levels and to monitor compliance with those standards to minimize any safety
problems. 


c. Restrictions on label or labeling claims based on section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act


17. One comment from a trade association stated that the literal reading of section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act prohibits
giving prominence on the label of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals to ingredients that are not vitamins
or minerals. The comment argued that these prohibitions result in the withholding of information that is of interest
to consumers, and that it is increasingly common for manufacturers to market products that offer a combination of
vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary substances. The comment stated that the principal reason for the purchase
of these products is not their vitamin and mineral content but the other ingredients. The comment invited FDA to join
the supplement industry in seeking an amendment to section 411 of the act that will remedy this problem. 
Another comment disagreed with FDA's interpretation of section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act and suggested that this section
merely prohibits giving prominence or emphasis to such ingredients. The comment argued that nutrients other than
vitamins and minerals or sources of vitamins and minerals should be permitted to appear outside or immediately following
the nutrition label, providing that such information is not emphasized by, for example, being presented in type size
greater than that used in the nutrition label. The comment stated that such limited declarations would not conflict
with current provisions of the act and would be fair and reasonable means of communicating about the presence of ingredients
that provide added value to many dietary supplement products.
The agency is persuaded by these comments that a clarification of those sections of the proposal relating to section
411(b)(2)(B) of the act is needed. Section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act states that the labeling and advertising for dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals may not give prominence to or emphasize ingredients that are not vitamins, minerals,
or represented as a source of vitamins or minerals. Because of this provision, nutrient content claims about ingredients
that are not vitamins or minerals (e.g., ``more fiber,'' ``high protein'') may not be made on dietary supplements
of vitamins or minerals. 
It must be emphasized that this provision pertains only to dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. If, for example,
an herbal extract includes vitamins and minerals but is labeled as an herbal extract, in compliance with  101.9
and other applicable provisions, and is advertised as such, section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act would not apply. The same
is true for a product that is primarily a protein supplement. A protein supplement with added vitamins and minerals
that is labeled and advertised as a protein supplement could declare that it is high in fiber. Such claims are permissible
as long as they are made in accordance with section 403(r) of the act, and they are not false or misleading in any particular.

However, section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act makes clear that in the labeling and advertising of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals, ingredients other than vitamins or minerals cannot be emphasized or given prominence.
FDA interprets prominence not solely as a function of type size. Declaring an ingredient outside or immediately following
the nutrition label is another means of giving prominence. For example, a statement such as ``5 g psyllium,'' except
in extremely limited circumstances, cannot be made on the principal display panel, outside the nutrition label,
or immediately following the nutrition label of a dietary supplement of vitamins and minerals because such placements
give prominence to that ingredient. However, the declaration of psyllium in the ingredient list would not be construed
as giving prominence to that ingredient. On the other hand, ``5 g psyllium'' could be declared in an amount statement
on the principal display panel, outside, or immediately following the nutrition label on protein supplements, on
dietary supplements of herbal extracts, and on dietary supplements of other similar nutritional substances so long
as these dietary supplements are not subject to section 411 of the act.
FDA advises that if a sugar is an ingredient in a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals, claims about the amount
of sugar actually in the product would have to be restricted. However, ``sugar-free'' and ``no added sugar'' are absence
claims that assert that sugar is not an ingredient. The agency concludes that the use of these terms is acceptable on
dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, as well as on other types of dietary supplements.
In view of this clarification, the agency believes that section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act, as written, is sufficiently
flexible to accommodate claims on products that are not dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals. FDA believes
that it is therefore unnecessary to amend section 411 of the act. 


2. Nutrient Content Claims for Sugar Content


18. One comment questioned the appropriateness of allowing ``sugar-free'' claims for a dietary supplement containing
less than 0.5 g of sugars. The comment stated that many supplements come in capsules or tablets that weigh slightly
less or not much more than 0.5 g, and therefore, supplements that are mostly sugars could use the term ``sugar-free.''
The comment suggested that the term ``sugar free'' on a dietary supplement should mean a much lower amount of sugars,
or that the product should be totally devoid of sugars. 
The comment also argued that terms such as ``negligible source of sugar,'' ``dietarily insignificant source of sugar,''
and ``trivial source of sugar'' are not synonymous with ``sugar-free'' because such terms connote the presence of
some sugar content. 
FDA is not persuaded by the comment that 0.5 g or less of sugars per serving is an inappropriate definition of insignificance
for sugars for dietary supplements. Section 101.60(c)(1) provides that for a food in conventional food form to make
a ``sugar free'' claim, the food must contain less than 0.5 g of sugars per reference amount. Less than 0.5 g of sugars
per reference amount is an amount that is consistent with the agency's policy of defining ``free'' claims at or near
the reliable limit of detection and in an amount that is dietetically inconsequential (56 FR 60421 at 60432). As a result,
even frequent consumption of a food bearing a ``sugar free'' claim would not result in an intake of sugars that would
affect the overall diet in any meaningful way. 
FDA acknowledges that there may be situations in which a dietary supplement may contain a significant proportion
of sugars on a weight basis and be able to make the claim ``sugar free.'' The agency believes, however, that even in such
instances, if the total amount of sugars in a serving of the product is less than 0.5 g, its net contribution to the total
daily diet would be inconsequential. 
Additionally, FDA considers it important that nutrient content claims correspond with the nutrition label, which
serves as a source of specific information for consumers concerning the nutritional value of the food. The nutrition
labeling regulations allow foods containing less than 0.5 g sugars per labeled serving to declare 0 g of sugars (  101.9(c)(6)(ii)
and 101.36(b)(3)). 
FDA rejects the suggestion that it permit use of the term ``sugar free'' only where there is an absolute absence of sugars.
FDA believes that it is appropriate to apply the term ``free'' to a nutrient when a food contains that nutrient in a dietetically
trivial or physiologically inconsequential amount, even though the nutrient is present at a level at or near its reliable
limit of quantitation, because with modern analytical methods, the level at which the presence of a nutrient may be
quantified is becoming increasingly smaller (58 FR 2302 at 2320). The agency believes that it is appropriate to focus
on dietary insignificance, and very trivial amounts have no impact on the diet for the purpose of defining ``sugar
free.''
The agency also disagrees that the terms ``negligible source of sugar,'' ``dietarily insignificant source of sugar'',
and ``trivial source of sugar'' are inappropriate synonyms for ``sugar free.'' Section 403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act
states that a nutrient content claim must be defined by regulation. In addition, section (3)(b)(1)(A)(ix) of the
1990 amendments provides that those regulations may include similar terms commonly understood to have the same meaning.
The agency is not aware of any reason why the above terms are inappropriate synonyms for ``sugar free.'' Although these
synonyms do not convey the absolute absence of sugar, they reflect that the amounts are dietetically trivial and of
no dietary significance. Therefore, the agency rejects this comment.
 19. One comment stated that the term ``no added sugar'' can be used only when a product is expected to contain sugar,
but that consumers do not know when supplements are expected to contain sugars. The comments suggested that FDA should
not preclude the use of the term ``no added sugars'' as this term would be useful to consumers in identifying those products
without sugar.
The agency is persuaded that a review of the conditions for the use of the term ``no added sugar'' is warranted. FDA did
not propose to preclude the use of the term ``no added sugar'' on all dietary supplements. The agency finds that this
term is appropriate for some dietary supplements, such as children's chewable vitamins, that are frequently sweetened.
Section 101.60(c)(2) states that the terms ``no added sugar,'' ``without added sugar,'' or ``no sugar added'' may
be used only if: (1) No amount of sugars, as defined in  101.9(c)(6)(ii), or any ingredient that contains sugars,
or that functionally substitutes for added sugars is added during processing or packaging, (2) the product does not
contain an ingredient containing added sugars, (3) the sugars content has not been increased above the amount present
in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, (4) the food that it resembles and for which it substitutes
normally is formulated with sugars, and (5) the product bears a statement that the food is not ``low calorie'' or ``calorie
reduced'' (unless the food meets the requirements for a ``low'' or ``reduced calorie'' food) and that directs consumers'
attention to the nutrition label for further information on sugar and calorie content. 
As is the case for foods in conventional food form, the agency believes that to avoid misleading consumers, the term
``no added sugar'' should be limited to dietary supplements that would be expected to contain added sugars. The agency
advises that the purpose of a ``no added sugar'' claim is to identify a food that differs from a similar food because
it does not contain the added sugars that would normally be present in the similar food. For this provision to be of practical
benefit to consumers, it must preclude the use of the claim on a food where the sugars that are normally added are replaced
with an ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for the added sugars. Thus, the agency concludes
that the use of any ingredient that contains sugars that would normally be added to a food precludes the use of the ``no
added sugar'' nutrient content claim. The agency believes that claims concerning the absence of added sugars on products
that would not normally contain added sugar (e.g., dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals for adults) are likely
to mislead consumers into thinking that a particular brand may be more desirable when compared to other brands of the
same product. 
FDA acknowledges that consumers may not know every type of product that could be expected to contain sugar. However,
the final rule on nutrition labeling for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 specifies that sugars will be listed in the ingredient label and must be declared in the nutrition label if present
in more than insignificant amounts. Through these provisions the consumer can readily ascertain which products
contain sugars.


C. Implied Nutrient Content Claims


1. Claims That are not Nutrient Content Claims


Section 101.65(b)(1) of the final rule on nutrient content claims provides that statements that declare the absence
of food components or ingredients that are not nutrients of the type required to be declared on the nutrition label,
and that are intended to facilitate avoidance for such reasons as food intolerance (e.g., lactose free), religious
beliefs, dietary practices such as vegetarianism or other nonnutrition related reason, (e.g., ``100 percent milk
free''), are not nutrient content claims. In the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, the
agency tentatively concluded that this paragraph is applicable to dietary supplements and requested comment on
other examples that are appropriate for dietary supplements.
20. Comments suggested that other examples of terms in this category include the following: gluten free, wheat free,
corn free, yeast free, starch free, milk free, egg free, soy free, no artificial ingredients, nonirradiated, and
no synthetic ingredients. The comments requested that FDA confirm that these statements are allowed on the label.

None of the terms that were submitted in the comments other than ``egg free'' would constitute nutrient content claims.
The term ``egg free'' can be interpreted as an implied claim about cholesterol. 
The agency points out that it does not currently have a definition for ``artificial'' except as that term applies to
flavors and colors. Similarly, it has no definition for ``synthetic'' except as that term applies to flavors and colors.
Although these terms have not been defined by FDA, the agency believes that they are not nutrient content claims unless
they are used in a context in which they explicitly or implicitly describe the level of a nutrient. However, even if
these terms are not nutrient content claims, manufacturers who use them must make sure that their use is not false or
misleading. 
21. FDA proposed to include dietary supplements in the coverage of  101.65(b)(4). This section states that
when an ingredient constitutes essentially 100 percent of a food, so that the name of the ingredient is the statement
of identity, the name of the ingredient generally does not constitute an implied nutrient content claim unless it
is used in a context to suggest that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount. FDA used a statement of identity
for a dietary supplement in which an ingredient constitutes essentially 100 percent of a supplement (e.g. ``60 mg_vitamin
C'') as an example. One comment pointed out that 60 mg vitamin C tablets contain excipients (fillers, binders, lubricants,
disintegrants) other than vitamin C. The comment requested clarification as to whether, in the example of vitamin
C tablets,  101.65(b)(4) requires that the amount claimed in the statement of identity constitute 100 percent
of the claimed amount of a food in  101.65(b)(4). 
In the example added to  101.65(b)(4), the amount refers to the claimed nutrient. A tablet stating ``60 mg_vitamin
C tablets'' should contain 60 mg of that nutrient. The agency recognizes that a nutrient will not constitute precisely
100 percent of some dietary supplements, such as vitamin tablets or capsules, and advises that small amounts of excipients,
binders, lubricants, or disintegrants added for technological purposes are allowable in addition to the stated
nutrient content. 
Additionally, FDA points out that under  101.3(c), if a food is marketed in various optional forms, the particular
form is a necessary part of the statement of identity. Because vitamin C is marketed in tablet, capsule, and liquid
form, the form is part of the name. Therefore, this food should be called ``60 mg-vitamin C tablets.'' The agency acknowledges
an error in this regard in the proposal and is revising  101.65(b)(4) to make the correction. 
22. One comment stated that it is not unusual for a dietary supplement to contain several nutrients of one type and a
single nutrient of another type, such as ``multiple-vitamins with iron.'' The comment requested confirmation that
``with iron'' would not represent an implied nutrient content claim.
The agency advises that a term such as ``with iron,'' when used on the statement of identity of a supplement, is intended
to describe the nature of the food. When a statement of identity simply states ``with iron'' or specifies the amount
of iron in a product (e.g., ``multivitamin with 15 mg iron''), the statement is not a nutrient content claim. Such statements
fall under  101.65(b)(5). 
However, as the agency stated in  101.65(b)(5), there may be cases in which other statements on the label or labeling
would have the effect of making the statement into a nutrient content claim. For example, if the labeling of a multivitamin
with iron includes a discussion of the importance of iron in the diet, FDA believes the statement ``with iron'' would
be an implied claim that the multivitamin is a good source of iron. If the labeling is devoid of such information, FDA
would be unlikely to consider the name to be an implied nutrient content claim. The agency will evaluate such claims
on a case-by-case basis in the context of the entire label and labeling to determine whether they are nutrient content
claims. 
23. One comment maintained that FDA failed to address whether the currently used claim of ``high in antioxidants''
was within the scope of the proposed regulation.
While the term ``high in antioxidants'' was not explicitly discussed in the proposed regulations for nutrient content
claims for dietary supplements, the agency considers it to be an implied nutrient content claim that would come under
 101.65. FDA's view is that this claim implies that the food on which it appears contains a ``high'' amount (i.e.,
at least 20 percent of the RDI, see  101.54(b)(1)) of each antioxidant. One problem with this claim, however,
is that there is no established definition of ``antioxidants.'' 
FDA believes that a logical place to start in defining this term is section 3(b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments. That
provision directed FDA to determine whether a health claim on antioxidant vitamins and cancer, could be authorized
under the standard that it established for dietary supplements under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act. In its proposed
regulations to implement the 1990 amendments, in response to this provision, FDA considered the effects of vitamin
C, vitamin E, and 

beta

-carotene on cancer because these nutrients are the vitamins or provitamins that function as antioxidants (56 FR
60624, November 27, 1991). In the final rule on antioxidant vitamins and cancer, FDA concluded that its selection
of these nutrients was appropriate (58 FR 2622, January 6, 1993). Thus, the agency has determined that the direct-acting
antioxidant vitamins or provitamins include vitamin C, vitamin E, and 

beta

-carotene. Based on its review of the information presented at a recent conference entitled ``Antioxidant Vitamins
and Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease,'' which was initiated by FDA, the agency is not aware of any basis to expand
this list because the biological role of other vitamins as direct antioxidants has not been confirmed (Ref. 3).
While it is arguable that FDA could authorize ``high in antioxidants'' as an implied claim pertaining to antioxidant
vitamins as a logical outgrowth of the proposal, because the claim applies to foods in conventional food form as well
as to dietary supplements, the agency believes that the better course is to propose to authorize such a claim. In addition,
the definition of ``antioxidants'' is not free from controversy. The agency is aware, based on its review of dietary
supplements whose labeling currently includes a ``high in antioxidant'' claim, that some manufacturers view this
term as including certain minerals. Antioxidant minerals have not been addressed by the agency, and, therefore,
final rules implementing the 1990 amendments do not provide for claims about them. Thus, FDA finds that a rulemaking
on the definition of ``antioxidants'' will provide an opportunity to establish the precise meaning of this term.
Consequently, FDA intends to address this issue as quickly as possible in a forthcoming proposal. Given that, elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the agency is establishing a date of applicability of July 5, 1995, for this regulation, FDA anticipates that there
is sufficient time to take final action on such a proposal before that date.


2. ``Healthier''


24. One comment from a manufacturer observed that FDA proposed a regulation concerning use of the term ``healthy''
(proposed  101.65(d)(2) (58 FR 2949)) in the January 6, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 2944 at 2949). The comment notes that ``healthy'' and similar terms are used in a variety of contexts. For example,
one of the manufacturer's dietary supplements is labeled as ``the way to






a healthier life.'' The comment suggested that this claim should not be deemed to be subject to the ``healthy'' definition.


FDA advises that it is in the process of finalizing regulations on the January 6, 1993, proposal for the claim ``healthy.''
The use of terms such as ``healthy,'' ``healthier,'' ``healthiest'' will be addressed in that final rule. 
In its final rule on nutrient content claims, FDA concluded that a claim that a food, because of its nutrient content,
may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices is a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient in that
food (58 FR 2302 at 2375). Accordingly, the agency provided in  101.65(d)(1) that such statements are implied
nutrient content claims and are subject to the requirements of section 403(r) of the act.
However, the agency also stated that when a term such as ``healthy,'' ``wholesome,'' or ``nutritious'' appears on
a food label in a context that does not render it an implied nutrient content claim, it is not subject to the requirements
of section 403(r) of the act (58 FR 2302 at 2375). Under such conditions, the use of the term is subject to section 403(a)
of the act, and FDA will consider whether it is misleading on a case-by-case basis. The agency intends to give more specific
guidance in the final rule on ``healthy.''


1. General Nutrition Claims Such as ``High Potency,'' ``High Absorption,'' and ``Balanced''
a. General issues


In the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, FDA requested comment on terms, ``high potency,''
``high absorption,'' and ``balanced,'' which are often encountered on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements
and which seem to imply that the dietary supplement will contribute to good health (58 FR 33731 at 33748). The agency
requested comment on whether there are established meanings for these terms, and, if so, whether they characterize
the level of the nutrients in the food. FDA stated that if comments demonstrate that there are accepted definitions
used in the dietary supplement industry for these terms that characterize the level of nutrients, and that if it determines
that these definitions will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, FDA will proceed with further
rulemaking to adopt the definitions or to propose new ones. 
FDA also stated that if the agency agrees that such terms are nutrient content claims, under the provisions of the statute,
such claims would be prohibited after the effective date for final rules, until such time as they are defined by FDA
by regulation. Further, FDA stated that if comments demonstrate that there are accepted definitions for these terms,
and they do not characterize the level of nutrients, in accordance with  101.65(d)(1) such terms would not be
subject to section 403(r) of the act unless used in a nutritional context in association with an explicit or implicit
claim or statement characterizing the nutrient content of the food. 
25. Several comments maintained that the terms ``high potency,'' ``high absorption,'' and ``balanced'' are implied
nutrient content claims and urged the agency to define or prohibit these terms. The comments stated that it is inappropriate
and fraught with possibilities for deception to allow each manufacturer to define such claims. One comment stated
that although these terms imply features of nutrient content to consumers, they do not have any established or useful
meaning with regard to dietary supplements. The comment argued that these terms seem to be more specific to dietary
supplements than to other food, so that their applicability in helping consumers make appropriate nutritional choices
from the variety of foods available seems limited. 
On the other hand, several comments stated that these terms do not inherently refer to the level of nutrients, are not
nutrient content claims, and therefore should not be defined. These comments maintained that such terms are formulation
descriptions, which properly and truthfully describe the nature and type of the product. These comments contended
that these terms have been used for many years, and that consumers have come to understand that products so described
provide an amount of the primary nutrients in the formulation that is at least equal to the RDA's for those nutrients.
One comment argued that FDA precedent exists for excluding such terms from regulation as nutrient content claims.
The comment stated that as formulation descriptions, these terms are useful to consumers in helping them to make product
choices, and manufacturers should be allowed to continue to use these terms in a manner that is consistent with FDA's
policy on claims such as ``maximum strength'' for internal analgesics in the over-the-counter drug review (i.e.,
kept outside the scope of this rulemaking). 
The agency agrees that these terms seem to have more direct application to dietary supplements than to foods in conventional
food form. Furthermore, these terms may have some utility in helping consumers select among dietary supplements.
However, while these terms have apparently been used for years to imply superiority, the agency is uncertain what
they mean to consumers.
The agency disagrees that these terms should be regulated in the same manner as terms such as ``maximum strength,''
which are used on the labels of over-the-counter drug products. The over-the-counter drug regulations include maximum
amount limitations. Section 411(a)(1)(A) of the act prohibits limits on the potency of dietary supplements of vitamins
or minerals except on the basis of safety. Therefore, the situations are not analogous.
The agency believes that each of these terms should be evaluated individually because they do not seem to be synonymous.
``High potency'' seems to focus on nutrient level or content, but ``balanced,'' as one comment suggested, seems to
be a formulation claim. ``High absorption'' seems to focus on how the body responds to the nutrient. The agency will
address each of these terms in more detail in the comments that follow.


b. Definition for ``high potency''


26. The majority of comments stated that the term ``high potency'' or ``full potency'' is an implied nutrient content
claim and should be defined. Several definitions were offered for this term. A few comments stated that multivitamins
and minerals are termed ``high potency'' when the majority of nutrients with established RDA's are present at the
levels equal to or in excess of the RDA. 
Similarly, another comment stated that the term should be restricted to formulations that contain micronutrients
at levels of at least twice the applicable RDI or DRV because a multivitamin at 100 percent of the DV might be ``high potency''
compared to a food in conventional food form but not ``high potency'' when compared to other dietary supplements.

Another comment suggested that FDA should require a ``high potency'' single-ingredient supplement to contain at
least twice the RDI, and that the front of the label should disclose what multiple of the RDI the supplement contains.
The comment acknowledged that under this scheme, some nutrients, such as calcium and selenium, would not qualify
to carry a ``high potency'' claim, because they are rarely sold at double the RDI. The comment suggested that if the
supplement industry begins to market those supplements at higher doses in order to make ``high potency'' claims,
then FDA could establish a lower minimum level, such as 50 percent more than the RDI for selenium or 50 percent of the
RDI for calcium. Those minimum levels would apply to those nutrients only. The comment also suggested that FDA should
allow ``high potency'' claims on multinutrient supplements when more than one-third of the nutrients that they contain
meet the minimum level required for a high potency claim, and the label discloses which nutrients are present at high
levels. For example, the label of a ``high potency'' multivitamin could carry an asterisk next to the claim, with the
following disclosure: ``contains high levels of [number] vitamins.''
Further, the comment stated that it is not reasonable to require that all of the nutrients in a multinutrient supplement
be present at levels that are necessary for high potency claims because many nutrients are not_and should not_be sold
in such high doses. For example, the comment suggested that ``high potency'' claims should be allowed on a multivitamin-and-mineral
supplement that contains at least double the RDI of vitamins A, C, E, B6, B12, thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin but smaller
amounts of vitamin D, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and copper. The comment stated that the latter nutrients are
typically sold at doses lower than double the RDI and may pose a risk at high levels.
FDA has reviewed the comments and is persuaded that ``high potency'' is a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient
and therefore meets the definition in  101.13(b) of a nutrient content claim. FDA also is persuaded by the comments
that this is a term that FDA should define in order to ensure that it will be useful to consumers in maintaining healthy
dietary practices. However, given the range and diversity of the suggested definitions, the agency is not prepared
to offer a definition of ``high potency'' at this time. FDA intends to review the suggestions it received on this issue
and based on information received in comments, issue a proposed rule on an appropriate definition of ``high potency.''

FDA recognizes that there is a need to provide this definition as quickly as possible. Therefore, FDA intends to act
on this matter as expeditiously as its resources allow.


c. Definitions for ``high absorption''


27. A couple of comments stated that the term ``high absorption'' does not refer to the level of nutrients but rather
to bioavailability or how efficiently the nutrients are released from the product and absorbed into the bloodstream.
One comment stated that ``high absorption'' means that the product meets the definition for ``high,'' and that a ``high
amount'' is digested and assimilated. 
Another comment stated that from a biological viewpoint, the extent to which nutrients are absorbed from food or supplements
depends not only on the chemical form of the nutrient itself but on the chemical environment presented by the carrier
food in which it is contained and on the physiological state of nutrient need of the individual consumer. Given these
factors, the comment stated that it is difficult to provide a meaningful definition of absorbability. 
One comment requested that the label should disclose information about the bioavailability of the product. Another
comment suggested that FDA should allow labels to make ``high absorption'' or similar claims only when the manufacturer
supplies bioavailability data showing that the product is better absorbed than a standard supplement. The comment
stated that the agency should not allow this claim on supplements that simply meet or exceed the United States Pharmacopeial
Convention's (USP's) (or other) standards for disintegration or dissolution, because meeting those standards
does not ensure that the product is well absorbed. 
The agency agrees that the term ``high absorption'' generally refers to how well a nutrient is absorbed into the system.
A product can be well absorbed irrespective of the quantitative amount found in the product. Accordingly, FDA finds
that ``high absorption'' is not a nutrient content claim and thus will not define this term. The use of this term is subject
to section 201(n) and 403(a) of the act, however. The agency expects that any product bearing a ``high absorption''
claim will contain the nutrients that are the subject of the claim in a form than can be readily assimilated by the body.
In addition, manufacturers who make a ``high absorption'' claim should have data available to support the claim and
should be prepared to make such data available to regulatory officials on request. Failure to do so could lead the agency
to conclude that there is no basis for the claim, and thus that it is false or misleading. 


d. Definitions for ``balanced''


28. A few comments stated that ``balanced'' is not a nutrient content claim. One comment suggested that ``balanced''
refers to the ratio of nutrients, not the level, and that the term can apply equally to products containing low or high
quantities of nutrients. Another comment stated that there is little need for FDA to define ``balanced'' because
most multinutrient supplements that are currently on the market do not contain nutrients in proportions that would
impair the absorption or utilization of other nutrients. The comment suggested that until researchers gain further
information on the most favorable proportions of nutrients in supplements, the agency should leave this term undefined
and therefore prohibited. Another comment suggested that ``balanced'' be defined as any supplement containing
from 50 to 150 percent of the RDI for each vitamin and mineral component of the product for which an RDI has been established.

The agency is persuaded by the comments that the term ``balanced'' does not typically characterize the level of nutrients,
but rather that it is a formulation claim that addresses the ratio of nutrients. The term ``balanced'' may be used in
different ways, each of which relates to the formulation of a product. For example, the term ``balanced'' may refer
to the assortment of nutrients that are present in a product, or it may reflect interactions between the nutrients
present, such as sparing effects or impairment or enhancement of absorption. Accordingly, this term does not meet
the definition for a nutrient content claim in  101.13(b). Therefore, the use of the term ``balanced'' is subject
to sections 403(a) and 201(n) of the act and not section 403(r) of the act. The agency will determine whether the use
of this term is misleading on a case-by-case basis.


e. Temporary suspension of the use of terms


29. One comment stated that use of the terms ``high potency,'' ``high absorption,'' and ``balanced'' should not be
suspended temporarily during the rulemaking process because such a suspension would result in unnecessary labeling
costs. Another comment requested additional time to comment on the definition of ``high potency'' and suggested
that until FDA defines this term, the agency should permit dietary supplement manufacturers to continue to use this
term as it is currently being used. The comment suggested that as an executive agency, FDA has inherent authority to
refrain from enforcing a statutory provision in circumstances in which the enforcement would do more harm than good.
The comment argued that to the extent that ``high potency'' is being used as part of a brand name (and was being used before
October 25, 1989), the 1990 amendments permit its continued use in the brand name until FDA has defined the term (section
403(r)(2)(C) of the act).
The comment argued that there is no reason for FDA to prohibit the use of a nutrient content claim while a definition
is being developed. Further, the comment noted that an enforcement moratorium would avoid the relabeling problem
that would arise if FDA disapproves and then reapproves use of the term within a short period of time. The comment stated
that FDA will continue to have authority to prohibit use of the term when such use is false or misleading. 
FDA advises that it intends to define ``high potency'' as a nutrient content claim in a separate rulemaking as quickly
as possible. The agency is postponing the date that it will apply this final rule on nutrient content claims on dietary
supplements until July 1, 1995. This postponement is discussed in detail in the document on the date of application
for the nutrition labeling and nutrient content claim requirements for dietary supplements found elsewhere in this
issue of the 

Federal Register

. FDA intends to complete its rulemaking on ``high potency'' in sufficient time to assure implementation by the time
that dietary supplement manufacturers will be required to comply with the nutrient content claim provisions.
The agency also advises that the term ``high potency,'' when used as part of a brand name, would fall under section 403(r)(2)(C)
of the act, if as the comment stated, it was used as part of the brand name before October 25, 1989. However, once this
term is defined by the Secretary, it will have to be used in a manner that complies with that definition. In addition,
use of the term in the brand name is subject to section 403(a) of the act, which prohibits the use of false and misleading
labeling irrespective of whether the use of the term in the brand name is exempt under section 403(r)(2)(C) of the act.
As discussed previously, the comments did not demonstrate that there are accepted definitions for any of these terms.
However, the comments have convinced the agency that the terms ``high absorption'' and ``balanced'' do not generally
characterize the level of nutrients. Accordingly, the agency concludes that these terms are not subject to section
403(r) of the act. 


4. Age Specific Claims


30. One comment stated that there are products with brand names that imply that the product is especially useful for
a particular segment of the population. The comment argued that it would therefore be appropriate for FDA to require
that these special formulas comply with clearly defined requirements (e.g., that they contain high amounts of particular
vitamins and minerals that are needed by the relevant group). Another comment maintained that such names mislead
consumers because they provide no explanation for those special population claims, and that in many cases, the supplements
do not contain levels of nutrients that are appropriate for the special population named in the claim. The comment
suggested that FDA should, at the very least, require labels to provide an explanation for these claims. For example,
an explanation for a product with a brand name implying that it is useful for women might state that ``this product is
especially suited for young women because it contains 100 percent of the RDI for folic acid and iron and 30 percent of
the RDI for calcium.''
FDA agrees that products marketed for special population groups may include claims or brand names that can be misleading.
These claims and brand names seem to imply a particular benefit for certain subgroups of the population and often do
not disclose how or why they meet the needs of that particular subgroup. Disclosure of such facts would help to protect
a product from being misbranded under section 403(a) of the act because its labeling would reveal material facts about
the product's claimed special usefulness.
However, such claims about the usefulness of a product for particular population groups generally fall under section
403(j) of the act to the extent that they represent the product to be for special dietary use. As special dietary use
claims, they are outside the scope of this rulemaking. Among other things,  105.3 defines ``special dietary
uses'' as ``uses for supplying particular dietary needs which exist by reason of a physical, physiological, pathological
or other condition, including but not limited to the conditions of disease, convalescence, pregnancy, lactation,
allergic hypersensitivity to food, underweight, and overweight; [and] [u]ses for supplying particular dietary
needs which exist by reason of age, including but not limited to the ages of infancy and childhood'' ( 105.3(a)(1)(i)
and (a)(l)(ii)). The agency intends to consider proposing regulations for such products. However, because of resource
constraints and other agency priorities, any such proposal will not be available in the immediate future. In the interim,
such claims will continue to be subject to the general misbranding provisions of sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the
act. 


5. ``Natural''


31. Several comments suggested that FDA define the term ``natural'' for dietary supplements because that term is
widely used in the labeling of dietary supplements even though there is no established definition of that term, and
it is misleading as it is now used. For example, one comment stated that studies indicate that natural vitamin E (d-

alpha

 tocopherol) is better utilized than synthetic vitamin E (dl-

alpha

 and other tocopherols), but that ``natural'' claims now appear on products containing synthetic vitamin E, misleading
consumers who think they are getting a better utilized product. The comment stated that in other instances, companies
use the term ``natural'' to mean that the product contains no artificial ingredients. 
One comment acknowledged that FDA has struggled with how to define this term for foods in conventional food form. This
comment suggested that the agency need not resolve the dilemma at this time, but that it should simply establish a supplement-specific
definition, just as FDA has established a special definition for ``natural flavor'' in  101.22. Another comment
suggested that FDA should allow ``natural'' claims on products containing only the naturally occurring form of a
vitamin. The comment suggested that FDA could request comments about whether to limit ``natural'' claims to nutrients,
such as vitamin E, that appear to offer some advantage when consumed in a natural form. The comment also stated that
many consumers will want the option of purchasing other nutrients in the natural form as well.
FDA is not persuaded by the comments that the term ``natural'' should be defined at this time. As one comment acknowledged,
the agency has recently expended its resources exploring the use of this term, and it was unable to arrive at an acceptable
definition (58 FR 2302 at 2407). FDA currently lacks sufficient resources to thoroughly explore and develop proposed
regulations for the use of this term on dietary supplements. 
In the final rule on nutrient content claims, the agency determined that it would maintain its current policy (as discussed
in the general principles proposal (56 FR 60421 at 60466) of interpreting this term to mean that nothing artificial
or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food
(Ref. 7). FDA also decided that it would continue to distinguish between natural and artificial flavors as outlined
in  101.22. The agency concludes that, for the reasons cited above, it is appropriate to apply this policy to
dietary supplements. 
In this regard, FDA also points out that  101.9(k)(6) states that a food labeled under the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be misbranded under sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the act if its label or labeling represents,
suggests, or implies, ``that a natural vitamin in a food is superior to an added or synthetic vitamin or to differentiate
in any way between vitamins naturally present from those added.'' 


V. Other Provisions


FDA did not receive any comments that dealt specifically with the other provisions of the proposal. In the absence
of any basis for doing otherwise, FDA is adopting those provisions as proposed. 


VI. Economic Impact


In its dietary supplement labeling proposals of June 18, 1993, FDA stated that the proposed rules on the labeling of
dietary supplements, taken as a whole, would have associated costs of approximately $20 million. Thus, the agency
concluded that the proposed rules would not constitute a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291. In accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), FDA explored whether the proposed rules may have a significant
impact on small businesses and tentatively concluded that they do not.
FDA has evaluated the many comments that it received in response to its economic impact analysis. Because the issues
raised in the comments relate to all three proposals, FDA has combined its discussion of these comments and presented
them in the final rule regarding the date of application published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules amending 21 CFR as required by Executive Order 12866
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the agency to analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
FDA has concluded, based on its review of the available data and comments, that these final rules are not significant
as defined by Executive Order 12866. Further, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies
that these final rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.


VII. Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act


In the June 18, 1993, proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33749), FDA announced
that the agency had submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review the collection of information
requirements contained in proposed  101.69, for petitions regarding the use of nutrient content claims in
conjunction with food labeling on dietary supplements. Also in that document, FDA published its estimated annual
collection of information burden for this provision.
None of the more than 500 comments received in response to the dietary supplement proposal addressed the content of
petitions under the proposed nutrient content claim petition requirements. Thus, the agency's estimated annual
reporting and recordkeeping burden from the health claim petition requirements contained in this final rule remains
unchanged from that announced in June.
FDA has submitted copies of the final rule to OMB for its review of these reporting requirements.

Food Labeling; General Requirements for Health Claims for Dietary Supplements


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its food labeling regulations to make dietary supplements of vitamins,
minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements) subject to the same general requirements
that apply to all other types of food with respect to the use of health claims that characterize the relationship of
a substance to a disease or health-related condition on the label or in labeling and the content of petitions for obtaining
authorization for such health claims. This action is being taken in response to provisions of the Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act) that bear on health
claims.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


On November 8, 1990, President Bush signed into law the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101-535). This new law amended
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One of the notable aspects of the 1990
amendments is their confirmation of FDA's authority to regulate health claims on food labels and in food labeling.
The new provisions amended the act by adding a provision, section 403(r)(1)(B) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)), that provides
that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related
condition, unless the claim is made in accordance with sections 403(r)(3) of the act (which pertains to foods in conventional
food form) or 403(r)(5)(D) (which pertains to dietary supplements). 
Congress enacted the health claims provisions of the 1990 amendments to help U.S. consumers maintain healthy dietary
practices and to protect these consumers from unfounded health claims. The House Report of June 13, 1990, states,
``Health claims supported by significant scientific agreement can reinforce the Surgeon General's recommendations
and help Americans to maintain a balanced and healthful diet'' (Ref. 1). In addition, the statement of the House Floor
Managers noted that ``There is a great potential for defrauding consumers if food is sold that contains inaccurate
or unsupportable health claims'' (Ref. 2). The House Report characterized the need for regulation of health claims
as ``compelling'' (Ref. 1). 
FDA's first step to effect the health claims provisions of the 1990 amendments appeared in the form of a November 27,
1991, proposed health claims regulation (56 FR 60537) (hereinafter referred to as ``the health claims proposal'').
That document proposed to establish general requirements pertaining to the use of health claims that characterize
the relationship of a food component to a disease or health-related condition on the labels and in labeling of both
foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements. The health claims proposal contained definitions to clarify
the meaning of specific terms used in the regulations, preliminary requirements that a component of food must meet
to be eligible to be the subject of a health claim, a scientific standard for assessing the validity of claims, general
labeling requirements for health claims that are permitted by regulation, and prohibitions on certain types of health
claims. Also, the health claims proposal contained provisions pertaining to the required content of petitions for
health claims. 
In response to the health claims proposal, FDA received over 6,000 letters, each containing one or more comments,
from consumers, health care professionals, universities, State and local governments, foreign governments, trade
organizations, consumer advocacy organizations, research institutes, industry, and professional organizations.
Many of the comments pertained to dietary supplements. The agency summarized and addressed the issues raised in the
comments in the final rule on health claims that published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2478) (hereinafter referred to as ``the health claims final rule''). The health claims final
rule became effective on May 8, 1993. 
Although the health claims proposal pertained to dietary supplements as well as foods in conventional food form,
the final rule applied only to the latter type of foods. In October of 1992, Congress passed the DS act (Pub. L. 102-571),
which imposed a moratorium on FDA implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements until
December 15, 1993. The DS act provides that by June 15, 1993, FDA was to have issued proposed rules to implement the 1990
amendments with respect to dietary supplements, and that by December 31, 1993, the agency is to issue final rules based
on these proposals. The DS act also amends the 1990 amendments to reflect the fact that if the agency does not issue final
rules with respect to health claims for dietary supplements by December 31, 1993, the proposed regulations are to
be considered final regulations at that time. 
In the 

Federal Register

 of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33700), FDA responded to the DS act by issuing a proposal that sets forth a standard and procedure
for making health claims for dietary supplements (hereinafter referred to as ``the dietary supplement health claims
proposal''). In that proposal, FDA proposed to make health claims on dietary supplements subject to the same general
requirements that apply to health claims on all other types of food.
In response to the dietary supplement health claims proposal, FDA received over 1,200 letters, each containing one
or more comments, from consumers, health care professionals, universities, State and local governments, trade
organizations, consumer advocacy organizations, research institutes, industry, and professional organizations.
Some comments agreed with one or more provisions of the proposed rule without providing further grounds for support
other than those provided by FDA in the preamble to the proposal. Other comments disagreed with one or more provisions
of the proposal without providing specific grounds for their disagreement. Many comments addressed issues that
are beyond the scope of these regulations and will not be addressed in this document. For example, some responded to
various aspects of FDA's June 18, 1993, advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the general regulation
of dietary supplements (58 FR 33690). Most of the comments, however, addressed the proposed regulations and provided
specific grounds in support of their positions. The agency has summarized and addressed the issues raised in the comments
in the discussion that follows. 


II. Regulatory Approach


A. General Approach Based on FDA's Review of the 1990 Amendments 


The 1990 amendments did not provide a specific standard for when a health claim should be authorized on dietary supplements
or a specific procedure for authorizing such claims. Under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act, the establishment of
such a standard and such a procedure is left to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
(and, by delegation, FDA). Thus, in the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33702), FDA reviewed
the legislative history of the 1990 amendments to identify the features that Congress intended would guide the agency's
choice of a scientific standard and procedure for regulating health claims on dietary supplements. FDA identified
the following features that it believes should guide its choice:


o The regulations are to deal only with the procedure and standard for health claims for the substances in dietary supplements.
They are to have no bearing on the availability of any dietary supplements. 
o The regulations must prohibit the use of health claims that are not authorized under their provisions. 
o The regulations must ensure that any health claims that appear in labeling are scientifically valid.
o The regulations must ensure that any health claims that appear in labeling are understandable.
o The regulations should be such that all segments of the food industry are treated fairly and in a consistent manner,
unless there is an appropriate basis on which to draw a distinction. This factor embodies a principle of equity implicitly
in the act.



(58 FR 33700 at 33703)



With these features in mind, FDA considered all of the approaches of which it was aware that might be used to regulate
dietary supplements. The agency tentatively concluded that it should adopt an approach that would subject dietary
supplements to the same standard that applies to foods in conventional food form. FDA stated that it was its tentative
view that that approach strikes the appropriate balance between the congressional concern for consumer fraud, public
health, and sound science, on the one hand, and the desire to provide the consumer with information on the other. Furthermore,
the agency advised that if it adopts this standard for dietary supplements, all foods will be regulated under the same
standard. 
FDA pointed out that under the same procedure that applies with respect to claims for substances in food in conventional
food form, there is a premarket review that ensures that the safety of the substance that is to be the subject of the claim
has been established as well as the scientific validity of the claim. A claim linking a substance to a disease, whether
on a food in conventional food form or on a dietary supplement, is intended to increase intake of that substance. Thus,
the agency said, it is important to ensure that a claim encouraging such increased intake can be safely implemented.
Therefore, FDA proposed to adopt the same procedure for health claims for dietary supplements as for foods in conventional
food form. 


1. Availability of Dietary Supplements


1. A great many comments, primarily from consumers, raised objections that indicated that the commenters were misinformed
about the proposed regulations, or that they simply did not believe what FDA stated in the dietary supplement proposal.
Many of the comments expressed considerable anger, resentment, and even fear over the proposal. A large number of
these comments characterized the proposal as an attack against the dietary supplement industry. Many of these comments
stated that FDA is plotting to ban all dietary supplements. A number of comments explained that the proposed regulations
would limit the number of dietary supplements available to consumers by limiting the amount of health information
that could appear on supplement labels and thus diminish supplements' marketability. The comments maintained that
FDA's proposed policy of requiring premarket review of a supplement's safety is contrary to the agency's stated intent
to preserve supplement availability and consumer choice. Some of the comments maintained that many manufacturers
would be put out of business. Many of the comments argued that the nation's health would be adversely affected, and
that health care costs would increase without dietary supplements to maintain good health. Some comments contained
testimonials that certain dietary supplements were responsible for curing and preventing a variety of diseases,
including cancer. 
However, a few comments pointed out that assertions that FDA plans to ban dietary supplements are unfounded. A number
of these comments predicted that the vast majority of dietary supplements will remain in the marketplace because
about 80 percent of supplement labels are already in compliance with the proposed provisions. 
There is no basis for virtually all of the concerns raised in the comments about the availability of dietary supplements.
Nothing in these regulations will make them unavailable to consumers. These regulations focus only on ensuring that
health claims, if made on the labels or in the labeling of dietary supplements, are scientifically valid and understandable.
Thus, the availability of dietary supplements will not be affected by these regulations. While it is likely that some
claims may have to be removed from product labeling as a result of this final rule, the products themselves can continue
to be marketed.
It is true that prohibiting the use of claims that have not been authorized by FDA may have an adverse impact on the marketability
of some products. However, any such impact is outweighed by the need to assure consumers that the claims that are made
in labeling are scientifically valid, and that they can rely on such claims. In fact, the only products whose marketability
will ultimately suffer under these regulations will be those whose labeling has borne claims that cannot be supported
by the available scientific evidence. 
The requirement that the agency be confident that the presence of a health claim will not result in unsafe intakes of
the substance that is the subject of the claim is not inconsistent with supplement availability and consumer choice.
If a manufacturer does not choose to make a claim about a substance, nothing in these regulations will affect the manufacturer's
ability to continue to market supplements that contain that substance. FDA believes, however, that it has an obligation
to ensure that before it authorizes a claim that encourages consumers to increase their consumption of a substance,
it have some assurance that increased consumption of that substance will not be harmful. 


2. Fair and Consistent Treatment of All Segments of the Food Industry


2. Many comments asserted that FDA has not been evenhanded in its approval of health claims for use on dietary supplements
and on foods in conventional food form. Some of these comments maintained that FDA's unfair treatment of dietary supplements
is evidenced by the agency's approval of health claims involving cancer and coronary heart disease for use on fruits,
vegetables, and grain products but not for use on fortified foods or supplements that provide fiber or antioxidant
vitamins. The comments stated that FDA should authorize health claims involving particular nutrients for use on
any food that contains those nutrients, including dietary supplements, unless there is significant scientific
agreement that the claim is valid only when the nutrient is consumed in a particular form. To ensure that such an approach
is taken in evaluating health claims for use on dietary supplements in the future, a few comments requested that FDA
add the following provision to the end of  101.14(g) (21 CFR 101.14(g)):


A health claim that has been approved for any substance that is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels
shall be permitted on all foods (including dietary supplements) containing the requisite amounts of that substance,
unless FDA determines that (i) there is significant scientific agreement (as defined in subparagraph (c)) that the
consumption of the substance in the particular food will not provide the benefits claimed, or (ii) the food contains
disqualifying amounts of another substance. 


A few comments contended that FDA also has treated dietary supplements unfairly by withholding approval of a health
claim concerning the role of folic acid in reducing the risk of neural tube defects (NTD's) simply because of its concerns
that allowing the claim on foods in conventional food form would raise safety issues because of overfortification
of the food supply and the subsequent effect on certain subpopulations. These comments asserted that the proper course
of action for the agency would have been to allow health claims on dietary supplements but to prohibit their use on foods
in conventional food form until the public health concerns associated with such use had been resolved. 
However, a few comments supported FDA's decision to approve particular health claims for use on fruits, vegetables,
and fiber-containing grains while not authorizing their use on dietary supplements or fortified foods with added
antioxidant vitamins or fiber. These comments noted that there are many compounds in fruits and vegetables that may
be involved in reducing the risk of disease that may not have been identified. The comments asserted that before allowing
a dietary supplement to bear a health claim authorized for use on food in conventional food form, it is important to
establish that the supplement provides the same health protection benefits as the conventional food.
FDA disagrees with the assertions in the comments that it has been unfair with the dietary supplement industry with
respect to its approval of specific health claims. FDA believes that the health claims should be consistent with the
scientific evidence available to the agency. In the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2537, 2552, and 2622), FDA explained why it was authorizing health claims pertaining to: (1)
Heart disease and diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that
contain fiber; (2) cancer and diets low in fat and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber;
and (3) cancer and diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables that may contain fiber, vitamin A (

beta

-carotene) and vitamin C. The agency also explained in detail why it was not authorizing health claims pertaining
to any specific nutrients (i.e., heart disease and dietary fiber, cancer and dietary fiber, and cancer and antioxidant
vitamins). 
In the case of the antioxidant vitamins, FDA found that although there was sufficient evidence to justify a health
claim concerning the relationship between diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables that may contain fiber,
vitamin A, and vitamin C and a reduced risk of cancer, the available evidence did not provide a basis on which to attribute
the reduction in risk of disease to any individual vitamin or combination of vitamins, regardless of whether the vitamin
is classified as an antioxidant or not (see discussion under section IV., 58 FR 2622 at 2633). Yet, because of the usefulness
of vitamins A (as 

beta

-carotene) and C and dietary fiber in identifying those fruits and vegetables that correlate with reduced cancer
risk, FDA identified these nutrients as being characteristic of the foods associated with a protective effect. Any
one or a combination of these three nutrients can serve as the identifying marker. Moreover, because fruits and vegetables
are also characterized by an absence of fat, and because of the identified relationship of low fat diets to reduced
risk of cancer, FDA highlighted low fat intakes as part of the dietary pattern associated with decreased cancer risk.
Because the mechanism of the protective effect of fruits and vegetables is not known, and because it is not possible
to determine which of the nutrients or other components in fruits and vegetables is causing the observed effect, the
health claim authorized by FDA focuses on fruits and vegetables as a class of foods and their relationship to cancer
risk, and not on particular nutrients. By requiring that all characterizing nutrients be identified as characteristic
of dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables without specifically attributing reduced cancer risk to a single
nutrient or single type of nutrient (antioxidant vitamins), FDA made the claim consistent with the scientific knowledge
available to it at the time it authorized the claim.
Because of the rapidly evolving science base relative to this topic, however, FDA has continued to update its evaluation
of the scientific evidence and the degree of scientific agreement on the relationship between antioxidant vitamins
and cancer. As part of these efforts, FDA initiated, along with other major research and health organizations as cosponsors,
a public conference on antioxidant vitamins and cancer and cardiovascular disease that was held on November 1 through
3, 1993. The transcript of that meeting has been submitted to the Docket as a comment on the antioxidant vitamins and
cancer rulemaking, along with other comments received in response to the announcement of the conference (58 FR 54595,
October 22, 1993). FDA is reviewing the results of this conference and other scientific evidence that has become publicly
available since the publication of the January 6, 1993, final rule on antioxidant vitamins and cancer.
Similarly, in the case of heart disease and dietary fiber and of cancer and dietary fiber, the agency found that there
was insufficient evidence to attribute the reduction in risk specifically to dietary fiber or to specific fiber components.
The agency did conclude, however, that dietary fiber and soluble fiber, along with other nutrients, serve as useful
markers in identifying those foods for which the scientific evidence showed that inclusion in a daily diet was associated
with reduced risk of cancer and of heart disease (58 FR 2552 and 58 FR 2537).
For both topic areas, the agency also noted the inability of commonly used analytical methodologies to detect many
of the characteristics that vary among dietary fibers and that may be related to biological function (e.g., particle
size, chemical composition, water-holding capacity). With regard to heart disease, other components variable
associated with soluble fiber in foods (e.g., lipid components) may also contribute to a cholesterol-lowering effect.
FDA found that the inability to detect many of the differences among fibers, fiber components, and other substances
in foods that contain dietary fibers, including soluble fiber, and the general lack of conclusions as to the mechanism
of action of dietary fibers and fiber components were limiting factors on FDA's ability to draw conclusions from the
available evidence. Furthermore, FDA noted that foods high in dietary fiber are also generally low in calories and
total fat, factors that are associated with reduced risk of cancer. Fiber-rich foods are also generally low in saturated
fats and cholesterol, substances that also affect the risk of developing heart disease. Thus, some or all of the benefits
associated with diets high in fiber-rich foods could be the result of displacement of fat and saturated fat from the
total diet rather than an effect of fiber per se.
The agency stated that although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances or displacement
of negative substances (e.g., fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol) in such plant foods are not yet understood, populations
with diets rich in these foods experience many health advantages, including lower rates of heart disease and cancer.
Thus, FDA did not authorize the use of a health claim on the association between ingestion of dietary fiber, or specific
fiber components, and a reduced risk of heart disease or cancer. Instead, for cancer, FDA, to be consistent with the
available scientific evidence and prevailing scientific agreement, focused on fiber-containing grain products,
fruits, and vegetables as product classes. Similarly, for heart disease, FDA focused on fruits, vegetables, and
grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber. Because of the usefulness of dietary fiber or soluble
fiber in identifying the types of foods whose consumption is most likely to correlate with decreased cancer or heart
disease risk, these substances can serve as identifying markers for selecting useful foods, even in the absence of
adequate evidence of a direct effect of fiber.
FDA is aware, however, of the rapidly evolving nature of the science base relative to these topic areas. FDA intends
to update its review of the science by initiating, in the near future, along with other major research and health organizations
as cosponsors, a public symposium on dietary fiber and heart disease and cancer.
With respect to assertions concerning folic acid, FDA disagrees that it should have allowed health claims on dietary
supplements while prohibiting their use on foods in conventional food form. While FDA did not authorize a health claim
for folic acid and NTD's, in the final rule on heath claims and label statements for folic acid and NTD's published in
the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2606) (hereinafter referred to as ``the folic acid final rule''), the agency did announce
its plans to work expeditiously to authorize a claim, if appropriate.
The agency noted that the Public Health Service (PHS), including FDA, had recommended (Ref. 7) that all women of childbearing
age in the United States should consume 0.4 milligram (mg) (400 micrograms ( u g)) of folic acid daily to reduce their
risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other neural tube defects. FDA acknowledges that this recommendation
evidenced that significant scientific agreement existed regarding a relationship between folate and NTD's but
said that there were factors that prevented FDA from authorizing a claim. The agency said that the act must be read as
a whole, and that sections 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) and 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 348) reflect the proposition that the use
of a substance that is the subject of a health claim must be safe. The agency pointed out that the PHS recommendation
stated that there were significant questions that persist about the safe use of folic acid in food. As stated in the
folic acid final rule, FDA expected that the authorization of a claim would likely result in significant increases
in consumption of folic acid by women in their childbearing years and by the general population, because manufacturers
would add folic acid to their products in order to claim that these products were useful in reducing the risk of birth
defects. Intakes of multiple doses of folic acid from supplements and from its increased presence in the food supply
could rapidly result in intakes of 3 to 7 mg (3,000 to 7,000  u g) per day (58 FR 2606 at 2614). Such intakes represent
increases of 10-fold or more above current intakes. 
In the folic acid final rule, the agency reviewed the safety considerations raised by such increases in folic acid
intakes, including: (1) Potential effects in persons with poor vitamin B12 status; (2) potential risks for persons
taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism; (3) potential risks for pregnant women because of uncertainties
about effects of high blood levels of folic acid on the embryo during gestation; and (4) uncertainties regarding possible
interactions between folic acid and other nutrients with increased folic acid intakes. The agency concluded that
it could not authorize a health claim on folic acid until the questions regarding the safe use of this nutrient were
satisfactorily resolved. In the folic acid final rule the agency described the efforts it was undertaking to address
and resolve these concerns. 
Following publication of this document, based on its review of the evidence, its discussions with an advisory committee,
and its review of the comments that it received, the agency tentatively concluded that the safety problems raised
by folic acid can be resolved by setting a safe upper limit of intake of 1 mg folate per day for all population groups.
The agency announced its tentative conclusion in a proposal to authorize a health claim on folate and neural tube defects
(58 FR 53254, October 14, 1993). In companion documents, FDA also proposed to amend the food additive regulation for
folic acid to specify the foods that could be fortified with folic acid and the level at which they could be fortified
(58 FR 53312) and to amend the standards of identity for specific cereal-grain products to permit the addition of folic
acid (58 FR 53305).
Thus, based on this review of the agency's actions, it is clear that the nondiscriminatory provision suggested in
the comments is not necessary. When FDA has concluded that a substance has a relationship to a disease, FDA has acted
to authorize a claim (see final rule on calcium and osteoporosis (58 FR 2665) and the proposed rule on folic acid and
neural tube defects (58 FR 53254)). In the case of antioxidant vitamins and cancer, dietary fiber and heart disease,
and dietary fiber and cancer, the evidence did not establish that the named substances had an effect on the named diseases.
The evidence showed that these nutrients were merely markers of foods that had been shown in studies to affect the risk
of the disease. FDA has reflected the scientific evidence in the claims that it has authorized and proposed to authorize.
Any other course of action would be inconsistent with the act because it would result in claims that were both not scientifically
valid and misleading.


B. Alternative Approaches


In the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33703), FDA advised that a variety of approaches had
come to FDA's attention about how health claims for dietary supplements would best be regulated under the 1990 amendments.
These approaches came to the agency's attention by various means, including the comments on the health claims proposal
that addressed the most appropriate method for regulating dietary supplements, testimony before Congress about
implementation of the 1990 amendments, as well as the legislative history of the 1990 amendments. FDA carefully evaluated
each of these approaches to determine how they compare with the characteristics that FDA has listed above. A number
of comments addressed the agency's tentative conclusions about these approaches. 


1. Use of Advisory Committees


In the dietary supplement health claims proposal (see section II.B.1., 58 FR 33700 at 33704), FDA advised that it had
tentatively decided not to adopt a committee-based approach suggested in comments for evaluating the validity of
health claims on herbs. This approach, known as the Botanical Ingredient Review (BIR), would involve the establishment
of expert panels under the direction of an oversight committee. FDA would participate as a nonvoting member of the
expert panels. The oversight committee, which would be charged with the responsibility of reviewing all health claim
petitions pertaining to herb or botanical components, would relieve FDA of all responsibility for initial review
of these petitions. Each expert panel would conduct an evaluation of scientific data pertaining to the requested
claim, subject the evaluation to peer review, and prepare a final recommendation about the claim. The recommendation
and all supporting documents would then be forwarded to FDA, and the agency would be permitted 120 days to approve,
disapprove, or modify the report. Under draft regulations prepared and submitted for FDA adoption by one comment
on the health claims proposal, there would be a codified presumption in favor of the committee recommendation. 
The agency based its tentative decision about the BIR on its belief that the suggested approach would involve a significant
transfer of agency authority on health claims because of this presumption in the draft regulations submitted by the
comment. Under this presumption, FDA would be obligated to prove that the committee was wrong if the agency decided
not to follow the committee's recommendation. In such circumstances, FDA could be forced to propose to authorize
health claims that it was not satisfied were scientifically valid. FDA noted that there is no basis under the act for
such a transfer. Also, the agency noted that the creation of such a committee would be financially burdensome and stated
that it would be inappropriate to commit its limited resources to a committee with as narrow a scope as that suggested
by the comment.
3. A few comments addressed this advisory committee issue. Some comments voiced opposition to FDA's tentative decision
not to establish a BIR. These comments disputed the agency's assertion that the establishment of a BIR would involve
any transfer of authority, noting that FDA would retain full and final discretion in approving health claims. The
comments also disputed FDA's finding that the creation of a BIR would be burdensome and costly in light of the agency's
limited resources. The comments stated that such a finding is inconsistent with FDA's current use of advisory committees
for very narrow subject matters such as over-the-counter (OTC) antiplaque products, circulatory system medical
devices, and drug abuse. The comments stated that the use of a BIR to help screen petitions from the much larger herbal
products industry would be an efficient, economical, and scientifically credible way to ration FDA's scarce resources
and would also help FDA meet statutorily-imposed deadlines for actions on petitions that it might not otherwise be
able to meet. 
The comments also asserted that the agency's statement that it has the ``ultimate responsibility to determine whether
the petitioned-for health claim is valid'' implies a mistrust of the integrity of the BIR process and the involved
scientists and reveals an agency belief that it is the only authority competent to judge the scientific validity of
health claims for herbal dietary supplements. The comments disagreed with such a conclusion and argued that health
claim petitions will only receive adequate and full consideration from the scientific community best qualified
to determine whether they meet the significant scientific agreement standard set by Congress through the creation
of a BIR, which would represent the most competent and knowledgeable body in a field that remains largely esoteric
to FDA. One of these comments suggested that appropriate selections for herbal experts panels might include experienced
herbal practitioners who are familiar with potential adverse reactions to herbs as well as medical practitioners
in foreign countries where herb safety has been studied by government and industry panels. The comment stated that
the inclusion of foreign medical practitioners would be especially appropriate during the evaluation of a claim
whose merits are agreed upon throughout the world but are not generally recognized in the United States, such as in
the case of using peppermint tea for its soothing or carminative effects on the digestive tract. 
However, one comment supported the agency's tentative decision not to adopt the BIR process. The comment stated that
FDA could well be legally liable for decisions made by the BIR that were later shown to have placed the public health
at risk.
Several comments called for FDA to establish an advisory committee for health claims for dietary supplements where
the committee would select expert panels responsible for the evaluation of proposed health claims for all dietary
supplements. The comments suggested that the expert panels should be composed of scientists and health care professionals
with expertise on a given nutrient-disease relationship as well as nonvoting industry and consumer representatives.
These comments contended that one reason for the agency's slowness in approving a health claim for folic acid has been
its reliance on advisory panels that were not sufficiently familiar with the research in the area and who had to be educated
about the strength of the evidence before they could act. Some of these comments suggested that FDA could retain the
authority to reject the recommendations of the committee, as long as it published its reasons for doing so. 
Another comment stated that both the dietary supplement industry and FDA have been slow to recognize and utilize a
great deal of research that has been done in the area of nutrition and health. The comment attributed this slowness
to a gap between the scientific community, FDA, and the dietary supplement industry. The comment suggested that in
order to close this gap, FDA should form a committee of its leading scientists to meet with a similar industry committee
every 3 to 6 months, or as required, to discuss the latest research in the area of nutrition and health published in highly
accredited scientific journals so that the research could be used to create and support health claim petitions. The
comment suggested that when the agency committee and the industry reach an agreement on the data, FDA could authorize
the use of a health claim on the nutrient-disease relationship on which there is agreement. 
FDA recognizes that advisory committees may make valuable contributions in assisting the agency to evaluate scientific
evidence about health claims in certain circumstances. For example, the Folic Acid Subcommittee of the Food Advisory
Committee provided valuable recommendations in support of FDA proposing to authorize a health claim for folic acid
and proposing to fortify cereal-grain products. The agency intends to continue its use of advisory committees wherever
the need arises. 
FDA believes, however, that it should retain the right to decide when the use of an advisory committee is necessary.
There may frequently be circumstances in which evidence establishes that use of advisory committees is not necessary
because the evidence shows that the claim is clearly supported or clearly not supported. In addition, if the agency
were to establish a standing advisory committee for health claims, FDA would want it to have a broader focus than just
dietary supplements. FDA's view is that claims should focus on the substance, and not the food in which it is found,
because the primary issue is whether the substance-disease relationship has been established. Thus, if FDA were
to establish a standing advisory committee, it would be on health claims in general. Although a number of comments
asserted that FDA lacks knowledge of herbal products, the agency believes that its personnel are fully competent
to evaluate properly substantiated petitions concerning health claims in this area. Also, if the agency were to decide
to establish an advisory committee, it would take steps to ensure that the membership of the committee had the necessary
expertise, including pertinent expertise on herbal products.
There is an implication in some of the comments that the evaluation of the scientific evidence supporting a claim is
somehow different depending on the substance involved. In fact, whether a claim is for a vitamin, mineral, herb, or
other similar nutritional substance, including fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, the skills needed for evaluation
of a claim are basically the same. These skills are found in epidemiologists, nutritionists, biostatisticians,
clinicians, and experts in the disease being addressed, as well as in people aware of how the substance is, or should
be, consumed. Thus, FDA does not agree with the implication in these comments.
FDA is interested in having communication with the dietary supplement industry. However, the agency does not believe
that it would be appropriate for the communication to take the form of the suggested standing committee to meet with
a similar industry committee every 3 to 6 months. While FDA believes that regular communication with the dietary supplement
industry is likely to be useful, the process by which health claims are authorized must be a more open and public process
than that suggested by the comment. Certainly the 1990 amendments envisioned a public process for claims for substances
in foods in conventional food form, as reflected in section 403(r)(4) of the act. FDA has been presented with no convincing
reason why a similar process should not apply to claims for substances in dietary supplements. 
Furthermore, FDA continues to believe that the BIR advisory committee approach would involve a significant transfer
of agency authority for health claims, even though comments on the health claims proposal and the dietary supplement
health claims proposal have made arguments to the contrary. The suggested regulation for health claims that was submitted
to FDA on May 10, 1991, and referred to by the agency in the proposals that it has issued, states in part:
B. If the Committee determines that a proposed health claim is appropriate for a particular herb or botanical, either
as proposed or as modified by the Committee, it shall forward its recommendation(s) to FDA together with all the data
and other information before the Committee when it made its decision.
C. If the Committee determines that, on the basis of the data, and other information before it, the proposed health
claim is not scientifically justified for the herb or botanical, it shall so notify the proposer. The proposer may
then direct the Committee to forward to FDA all the information before the Committee with respect to the proposal together
with its conclusions and the reasons therefore.
D. Within 120 days of receipt of the information described in (B) and (C) above, FDA shall either accept the recommendation,
reject it, or modify it based upon the Agency's independent evaluation with analysis and reasons for rejection or
modification of recommended health claims. In arriving at its decision FDA may consider data or information other
than that before the Committee. 

There shall be a presumption, to be sustained when the record is viewed as a whole, in favor of a Committee recommendation
under either (B) or (C).

 (Emphasis added.)
Despite assertions to the contrary, the last sentence of paragraph ``D'' obligates FDA to establish that the committee
was wrong in order not to follow the committee's recommendation. Ultimately, therefore, there would, in fact, be
a significant transfer of authority if the suggested provision were to be adopted by FDA. As FDA noted in the dietary
supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33704), there is no basis under the act for such a transfer of authority.
FDA does not question that experts on an industry committee or panel on herbs and botanicals could be helpful. The agency
encourages firms to work through such groups. For this reason, FDA revised the provision pertaining to petitions
in the health claims final rule to clarify that the agency will consider all recommendations by such committees and
panels (see  101.70(b)). FDA recognizes that those petitions that have undergone an independent scientific
review and received endorsement by qualified expert groups will likely be well-supported petitions and could be
very persuasive to FDA. Further, FDA is likely to place considerable weight on the recommendations of outside experts,
and its decision as to whether a petition should be granted could be influenced significantly by these experts. 
Although FDA encourages firms to work through groups of outside experts, the agency would be concerned if such groups
were heavily weighted with medical practitioners as one of the comments suggested. Over reliance on such practitioners,
to the exclusion of scientists representing other relevant scientific descriptives, implies that the herbs are
to be used for medicinal purposes. FDA stresses again that health claims are about the relationship of foods, rather
than drugs, to a disease or health-related condition.


2. Establishment of an Approach Based on a More Lenient or the Same Standard


FDA proposed to subject dietary supplements to the same scientific standard and procedure that the statute provides
for foods in conventional food form (section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the act). The standard, codified in  101.14(c),
states:


(c) Validity requirement. FDA will promulgate regulations authorizing a health claim only when it determines, based
on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted
in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant
scientific agreement, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that
the claim is supported by such evidence. 


FDA explained in the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33705) that it knows of no standard and
procedure for dietary supplements that would both be more lenient than the standard and procedure for foods in conventional
food form and yet still have the characteristics that FDA considers necessary under the 1990 amendments and their
legislative history. The agency stated that it had tentatively concluded that a standard for health claims for dietary
supplements that is based only on section 403(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C 343(a)(1)), or that allows health claims based
on the existence of substantial scientific evidence, even though significant scientific agreement about the validity
of the claim does not exist, would be inconsistent with Congress's desire to ensure that health claims that are made
on food, including dietary supplements, are scientifically valid. FDA said that it was concerned that if it were to
allow claims in the marketplace whose validity had not been established, these claims would undercut the credibility
of those health claims that are in fact valid. The agency said that if it were to allow such claims, consumers would be
left little better off, and no less confused, than they were in 1989, before the passage of the 1990 amendments. FDA
also expressed its tentative view that the proposed approach strikes the appropriate balance between the congressional
concern for consumer fraud, public health, and sound science, on the one hand, and the desire to provide the consumer
with information on the other (58 FR 33700 at 33706). 
4. A large number of comments asserted that FDA should establish an approach based on a more lenient standard for dietary
supplements. Some of these comments argued that such an approach is directed by Congress and cited a statement of Senator
Hatch, one of the primary authors of the 1990 amendments, that ``a more lenient standard for dietary supplement[s]
is envisioned.'' One comment argued that by providing for the establishment of a separate standard for dietary supplements,
Congress had implicitly rejected the rigid standard of ``significant scientific agreement'' adopted for foods
in conventional food form. The comment asserted that FDA was therefore bound by basic tenets of statutory construction
to adopt a more lenient standard for dietary supplements, as such an action would give meaning to Congress's instructions,
whereas the adoption of the proposed standard would in effect render those instructions meaningless. The comment
noted that courts have traditionally not interpreted provisions of a statute in ways that would render other provisions
superfluous. 
A number of comments stated that using the same standard and procedure for dietary supplements as for foods in conventional
food form is counter to the intent of the 1990 amendments because Congress intended to make more, rather than less,
information about the health benefits of dietary supplements available to consumers. The comments asserted that
health information about the effects of diet on disease is particularly important to consumers of dietary supplements
in deciding which products to buy. 
Several comments argued that restricting this information on dietary supplements will deny millions of Americans
the information that they need to improve their health and to help reduce their risk of deadly afflictions such as heart
disease and cancer. The comments asserted that such restriction will cost the nation millions of dollars in health
care expenditures that could have been saved through disease prevention. 
Some comments expressed concern that restricting the use of properly qualified health claims based on preliminary
evidence would encourage information-hungry consumers to seek information about the health benefits of various
dietary supplements from sources such as books and the media, which may be unreliable and which are not regulated by
FDA. These comments argued that adopting a policy that results in consumers turning to information that may well be
misleading or outright false is contrary to the educational goals of the 1990 amendments. One comment stressed that
FDA should assist consumers by encouraging them to reduce their risk of disease by changing their diets, lifestyle,
and other factors. 
Comments suggested that FDA should place more weight on the potential benefits of the health information than on eliminating
all possibility for consumer misunderstanding or all elements of risk associated with increased consumption of
dietary supplements. A few of these comments advised that a more lenient standard would be appropriate for dietary
supplements because they are being sold to educated consumers rather than to the general population. Some of these
comments disputed the argument that consumers could be misled by a more lenient standard. These comments noted that
consumers continue to rely on health messages on products such as cigarettes and condoms, despite the fact that the
messages have changed over the years in response to new scientific findings. Other comments stated that studies have
indicated that consumers are able to use various advertising claims about diet and disease in a rational and beneficial
manner.
Several comments asserted that FDA should allow the use of preliminary health claims on dietary supplements and foods
in conventional food form because it allows their use on drugs. The comments stated that FDA's proposed revision of
the``Pediatric Use'' subsection of prescription drug labeling in the 

Federal Register

 of October 16, 1992 (57 FR 47423) would allow prescription drugs that had not been tested for safety and efficacy in
children to nevertheless be given to children provided that the drugs' efficacy claims were qualified by the statement,
``Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.'' The comments stated that because these drugs
had not been tested for safety and efficacy in children, their claims would be ``preliminary'' at best and misbranding
at worst. 
However, many comments argued against a more lenient standard and procedure for dietary supplements. Several comments
stressed that the adoption of the proposed standard and procedure is supported by the legislative histories of the
1990 amendments and the DS act. One of these comments maintained that while the 1990 amendments give FDA the option
of adopting a more lenient standard for dietary supplements, the Congressional Record denotes a majority opinion
in favor of FDA applying the same standard to supplements that the act provides for conventional foods.
A number of comments also warned FDA that holding dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form to different
standards for health claims would lead to consumer confusion, as the health benefits of nutrients derived from dietary
supplements would be allowed to be characterized as superior to the benefits of those same nutrients derived from
foods in conventional food form. Some comments asserted that the creation of public confusion would directly undermine
the intent of the 1990 amendments to clear up consumer confusion about health claim information and would jeopardize
consumer confidence in existing health claims, food labels, and the government, particularly public health officials.
Another comment asserted that adopting a more lenient standard for dietary supplements could also allow some supplement
manufacturers to make unsubstantiated claims and undercut consumer belief in the credibility of the entire supplement
industry. These comments asserted that a single universal standard would best prevent consumer confusion by ensuring
that health claim information is uniform on all foods. 
Several comments supported the same standard and procedure on the grounds that it would ensure that health claims
appearing on the labels of dietary supplements are based on reliable, peer-reviewed, reproducible evidence. A number
of these comments stated that because supplements, unlike conventional foods, are taken specifically for the health
benefits associated with them, it is especially important that health claims on these products be reliable because
more and more consumers are using these products in the belief that the products will protect their health. The comments
said that these consumers were responding to the large amounts of recent evidence indicating that vitamins, minerals,
and other nutrients may play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases. 
Some comments cautioned FDA that the failure to ensure that health claims on dietary supplements are reliable would
leave consumers open to fraud. A few of these comments pointed out that many consumers do not have the scientific knowledge
to judge the veracity of label claims for themselves and presume that FDA regulations ensure that label claims are
properly substantiated. One of these comments warned that older Americans are especially vulnerable to fraud. This
comment pointed out that the elderly suffer disproportionally from diet-related diseases, read supplement labels
more often than other people, are more trusting of salespersons, and do less research than younger consumers. Other
comments warned that unsubstantiated health claims can harm consumers by inducing them to consume products that
are inherently unsafe, to consume excessive doses of some substances, or to forego more beneficial forms of treatment
for a given malady.
A number of comments insisted that the proposed regulations will not restrict the flow of information on nutrition
and health to consumers. One of these comments stated that roughly 80 percent of supplement labels are already in compliance
with the proposed regulations. Other comments noted that educational materials are not covered by the proposed regulations,
and that there are many available channels through which information can be freely disseminated other than food labeling.
Moreover, one comment contended that supplement labels are neither intended, nor currently used, to educate the
public but instead serve to sell the product to which they are attached.
Some comments stated that applying the same standard to both conventional foods and dietary supplements would create
a desirable ``level playing field'' for all food processors and manufacturers. One comment stated the adoption of
the proposed standard will provide an atmosphere in which all food manufacturers can move toward the production of
healthier foods, which will benefit the public health. 
In FDA's reconsideration of how best to regulate dietary supplements, one of the most significant issues has been
the issue of whether supplements should be regulated under a more lenient standard or the same scientific standard
as that established by Congress for food in conventional food form. Despite assertions by some that Congress directed
that a more lenient standard be established, the legislative history of the 1990 amendments does not support such
a position. To the contrary, as other comments point out, and as the agency explained in the preambles of the health
claims proposal (56 FR 60537 at 60539 through 60540), the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2507 through 2509),
and the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33703), Congress did not intend that the agency be
forced to adopt a different standard for dietary supplements. Instead, Congress gave the agency the discretion to
adopt any appropriate scientific standard and procedure for dietary supplements. There was nothing in the comments
that indicated that FDA does not have this discretion. Indeed, as some of the comments pointed out, there was considerable
support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate for adoption of the same scientific standard and procedure
for dietary supplements. FDA addressed the position of members of Congress on this issue in the preamble of the dietary
supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33703):


Senator Hatch left no question about his position that FDA should use this flexibility [to adopt the standard and procedure
for dietary supplements that appears appropriate to the agency] to adopt a more lenient standard * * * 
However, other members of Congress were equally clear about their position that FDA should not adopt a more lenient
standard. In the October 24, 1990 Congressional Record at S 16608 [Ref. 4], Senator Metzenbaum, the other primary
author of the Senate amendments, stated: 


* * * It is my view that there is no reason to do anything other than utilize the same procedure and standard for dietary
supplements.
Whatever approach the Secretary takes, he must establish a system that evaluates the validity of health claims for
dietary supplements. The system must be based on the same considerations that guide other agency decisions: public
health, sound scientific principles and consumer fraud. 


Further, the House of Representatives clearly did not support a more lenient standard for dietary supplements. The
statement of House Floor Managers that appears in the October, 26, 1990 Congressional Record at H 12953 [Ref. 2] states:



* * * Whatever approach the agency takes, it must adopt a system that evaluates the validity of any disease claims made
with respect to these substances. Its system must be based on considerations of public health and consumer fraud.
As in every similar decision made by the agency today, we fully expect that the agency's evaluation of disease claims
made with respect to vitamins will be based on sound scientific principles. 
There is a great potential for defrauding consumers if food is sold that contains inaccurate or unsupportable health
claims. The potential is just as great for vitamins as it is for other products. In our view, vitamins and other substances
covered by this provision should be subject to at least as strong a standard as is applicable to other foods that contain
claims that the food will treat a disease or health condition. 


Nothing in the DS act or its legislative history indicates in any way that Congress changed its position about its goals
of the 1990 amendments with respect to prohibiting misleading health claims and improvement of the public health
through use of valid and understandable claims in food labeling [Ref. 3].


Although Congress left no question that the exact standard and procedure for the regulation of health claims for dietary
supplements is left to the discretion of FDA, and although Congress did not provide direct guidance concerning how
FDA should use this discretion, Congress did provide considerable general guidance about the intent of the health
claims provisions of the 1990 amendments. In view of the fact that this guidance does not distinguish between dietary
supplements and foods in conventional food form, FDA considers this guidance to be applicable to both types of foods.
As pointed out above in this response, Senator Metzenbaum, the other primary author of the Senate amendments, stated
that whatever approach the Secretary takes, he must establish a system that evaluates the validity of health claims
for dietary supplements. He stressed that the system must be based on the same considerations that guide other agency
decisions: Public health, sound scientific principles, and consumer fraud (Ref. 4). The quoted statements of the
House Floor Managers also stress that the agency's approach to regulating dietary supplements must be based on considerations
of public health, sound scientific principles, and consumer fraud (Ref. 2). In addition, these quoted statements
make it clear that Congress considered the use of ``inaccurate or unsupportable health claims'' on food labeling
to be harmful to the public (Ref. 2). Moreover, Mr. Waxman, one of the House Floor Managers stated the following in the
July 30, 1990 Congressional Record (H5844):


What we have sought to do is to permit health claims but only health claims based on scientifically valid information,
and we hope by having that scientifically valid information upon which a claim can be made, that health claims in the
future will be healthful and not misleading. 


Furthermore, as the agency pointed out in the January 6, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 2478 at 2526): 


By enacting the 1990 amendments, Congress sought to ensure that health claims would be scientifically valid and not
misleading. (See, for example, statement of Rep. Madigan, and statement of Rep. Waxman, [Ref. 2]). Experience had
shown that many ``unfounded'' health claims were being used on foods (statement of Rep. Waxman [Ref. 2]). Congress
recognized the ``great potential for defrauding consumers if food is sold that contains inaccurate or unsupportable
health claims.'' Id. (statement of House floor managers). 
In response to the high potential for health claims to be misleading, Congress legislated that any claim that is not
consistent with FDA regulations will misbrand a food. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act states that a food is misbranded
if its label or labeling contains a claim that ``expressly or by implication * * * characterizes the relationship of
any nutrient * * * of the food to a disease or a health-related condition unless the claim complies with regulations
promulgated by FDA.  403(r)(1)(B)'' (emphasis added). By taking this approach, Congress chose to permit only
those health claims on food that FDA determines to be scientifically valid, effectively recognizing that health
claims are so potentially misleading as to be inherently misleading. 


Applying the same standard and procedure to health claims on dietary supplements as that that applies to foods in conventional
food form will not affect the availability of any dietary supplements, will ensure that health claims that appear
in labeling are scientifically valid and understandable, and will subject all segments of the food industry to regulation
in a fair and consistent manner. Those comments favoring the same standard and procedure, for reasons of fairness,
control of consumer fraud, and conveyance of valid information about diet and its impact on a disease or health-related
condition, serve to reinforce FDA's conclusion that the agency's proposed rule should be finalized as proposed.
The agency disagrees with arguments that use of the same approach for dietary supplements as for conventional foods
would deny millions of Americans the dietary information that they need to improve their health and thereby cost the
nation millions of dollars in health care expenditures that could have been avoided. As FDA explained in the preamble
of the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33705):



* * * In the absence of adequate data to establish that health claims are valid, assertions about costs associated with
the lack of information in food labeling and about the benefits of consumption of substances in dietary supplements
are highly speculative and highly questionable. FDA does not agree that it should place more weight on the potential
benefits of the health information than on eliminating the possibility of consumer misunderstanding. FDA must weigh
the public health impact of permitting a multitude of preliminary claims against the possibility that a significant
portion of those claims will be determined to be not scientifically valid. The latter result would likely produce
a perception among many consumers that food labels and health claims, even those that are valid, are not reliable.
To the extent that, as a result, consumers do not change their dietary patterns to reduce their risk of disease, they
will be less healthy, and there will be more needless deaths from disease and more costs to the national economy, rather
than less. 



When FDA made this statement, the phrase ``adequate data to establish that health claims are valid'' was intended
to express the position that until the validity requirements of  101.14(c) are met, cost assertions about the
benefits of substance consumption are highly speculative and highly questionable. In general, prior to fulfillment
of this requirement, there may often be studies with a wide variety of strengths and weaknesses indicating that there
may, or may not, be a valid association between a substance and a disease or health-related condition. In deciding
whether or not to authorize a claim, FDA must consider that, while benefits may accrue from the availability of the
claim, there is a very real possibility that significant costs may accrue if the claim is authorized prematurely.
A few studies may often be found about a multitude of associations, and many, if not most, of those associations will
ultimately be found not to be valid. If FDA were to permit preliminary claims about such a multitude of associations,
the agency believes that ultimately what would be lost is the confidence of most consumers in the validity of all claims
that appear in food labeling. FDA believes that the costs to consumers of such a situation would prove to be greater
than the costs of not permitting preliminary claims. Of greater significance, however, is that needless deaths would
ultimately occur where consumers would not change their dietary patterns to adopt a more healthful diet. 
The agency believes that Congress, in its enactment of the scientific standard in section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the
act, struck what it believed to be an appropriate balance between the costs and benefits of claims on foods in general.
FDA is not aware of any reason to strike a different balance for dietary supplements. FDA would like to assure all affected
parties that the agency will move as expeditiously as possible to permit health claims once the scientific evidence
is sufficiently supportive to conclude that associations between substances and disease or health-related conditions
are valid. 
Although some comments asserted that claims based on a more lenient standard would not be confusing because consumers
of dietary supplements are more knowledgeable than the general population, FDA pointed out in the preamble of the
dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33705) that there is nothing that limits the purchasers
of dietary supplements to ``knowledgeable consumers.'' The comments did not submit justification for FDA to change
its position in this regard. 
Assertions that use of the same scientific standard for dietary supplements as that established for food in conventional
food form is counter to the 1990 amendments because less information about diet and disease will be available to consumers
are not correct. Under the 1990 amendments, authorized health claims provide considerably more information about
the effects of diet on disease where the effects are recognized as scientifically valid than was the case before the
passage of the 1990 amendments. In the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993, FDA authorized claims with respect to 7 relationships (see 58 FR 2537, 2552, 2622, 2665, 2739, 2787,
and 2820). Also, in the 

Federal Register

 of October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), FDA proposed to permit health claims concerning the relationship between folate
and the risk of neural tube birth defects. Admittedly, other health claims are not permitted to appear on food labels
and labeling, but Congress clearly intended through enactment of section 403(r) of the act that only valid health
claims be permitted.
With respect to concerns that consumers will be forced to seek information about diet and health from






unregulated sources such as books and the media, if FDA does not authorize preliminary claims, FDA advises that it
must implement the provisions of the amendments as Congress chose to enact them. The 1990 amendments focus only on
food labels and labeling. FDA cannot ignore its clear responsibilities under the 1990 amendments because of concerns
about the unregulated sources of information that were mentioned in the comments. Moreover, while such sources of
information may lead consumers to seek out products containing particular substances, FDA's action will ensure
that the labels and labeling of those products contain only scientifically valid information that can dispel any
misconceptions created by the unregulated sources. With respect to other concerns expressed by these comments,
the agency believes that the specific required elements in the health claims that it has authorized to date demonstrate
that the agency is encouraging consumers to reduce their risk of disease by changing their diets and lifestyle. For
example, the specific requirements in  101.72(c)(2)(A) requires, in part, that a claim about calcium and osteoporosis
make clear that an adequate level of exercise and a healthful diet are needed in addition to adequate calcium consumption.


Arguments that the agency should allow preliminary claims because of FDA's implementation of the drug provisions
of the act have no merit. Assertions about FDA's proposed action pertaining to ``Pediatric Use'' for drug labeling
in (57 FR 47423) are clearly wrong. The agency's proposed action with respect to requiring the statement ``Safety
and effectiveness in children have not been established'' pertains only to drugs for which there is no agency approval
for any pediatric population to use the drug. In point of fact, the agency proposed to require this statement as a further
warning that the product should not be used for pediatric populations. Thus, this action provides no support for authorizing
preliminary health claims. 
As FDA pointed out in the preamble of the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33706), making dietary
supplements subject to the same scientific standard and procedure as for conventional foods does not render section
403(r)(5)(D) of the act superfluous. This section requires that the agency consider what procedure and standard
respecting the validity of claims are most appropriate. This is what the agency has done. The fact that the agency has
found that, on balance, the standard and procedure established for foods in conventional food form are also the most
appropriate for dietary supplements does not render the agency's efforts invalid or the underlying provision superfluous.
The agency was charged with exercising its expertise and discretion, and that is what it has done.
5. A number of comments provided specific suggestions about the way in which a more lenient approach could be implemented.
Some comments argued that the approach should be sufficiently lenient to permit marketing of dietary supplements
without any restrictions. Some of these comments argued that dietary supplements needed no stringent requirements
because dietary supplements could be adequately regulated under the requirement in section 403(a)(1) of the act
that the labeling of a food must be truthful and not misleading. Other comments suggested that FDA could require a warning
informing the consumer that FDA had not substantiated particular claims appearing on a product. One comment suggested
that substantiated claims could be allowed to appear within a specific advisory panel of the label, while preliminary
claims would be allowed to appear only outside the panel. Another comment suggested that FDA adopt a split label approach,
in which preliminary health claims would be allowed, but the agency would have the right to comment upon them on the
label. 
One comment suggested that health claims for which there is substantial scientific evidence but not yet significant
scientific agreement be subject to a certification and notification procedure rather than rulemaking proceedings.
Under the procedure suggested by the comment, claims could be made for dietary supplements so long as: (1) The claim
expressly discloses the absence of scientific agreement as to the relationship, (2) the manufacturer provides FDA
with a fully documented certification by a panel of at least three qualified experts that there is substantial scientific
evidence supporting the claim, and (3) FDA does not disapprove the claim within 90 days of receipt of the certification.
(When additional information is needed, the 90 day period could be extended an additional 45 days.) Under this suggested
alternative, FDA would have an opportunity to participate in the selection of the expert panel. 
One comment requested that FDA only disallow the use of those health claims on dietary supplements that are not supported
by any evidence, and that it classify all other health claims into one of five categories and allow for their use on products
in conjunction with a code system indicating to consumers the level of substantiation that the claim has achieved.
The comment suggested that the highest category be full substantiation; the second, those claims that have a high
degree of substantiation as judged by non-FDA experts, but that FDA finds to be not fully substantiated; the third,
claims that have support in the form of double-blind placebo controlled studies published in peer-reviewed professional
journals; the fourth, claims that are supported by some evidence from in vitro studies, animal studies, or other studies
that do not involve humans; and the fifth, those claims supported by anecdotal evidence. In support of its call for
various approval levels, the comment stated that simply categorizing a claim as ``substantiated'' or ``unsubstantiated''
does not accommodate the reality that full substantiation of a health claim consists of cumulative evidence from
many studies. The comment maintained that if FDA were to place all claims that have not achieved full substantiation
into the same category, FDA would not be providing a means for the public to distinguish claims that are nearly substantiated
from those that are entirely false. Moreover, the comment stated that an agency determination that a claim is or is
not supported by ``significant scientific agreement'' often reflects a political decision rather than a scientific
one. The comments said that FDA panels comprise a very small percentage of the scientific community, that other scientists
often disagree with the panels' findings, and that there even may be differing opinions within the panels themselves.
The comment stated that, given these conditions, it is blatantly dishonest and misleading to the public for FDA to
make a general declaration that a claim is or is not substantiated. 
A few similar comments called for FDA to devise a multilevel approval scheme for health claims on dietary supplements
that would allow statements concerning the traditional use of a product to appear on the label and would permit the
label of a supplement that contained a substance that was the subject of a pending health claim petition to indicate
that the product was under FDA review for a health claim but not to indicate the nature of the claim. The comments stated
that the adoption of this approach would encourage manufacturers of products that qualify only for the ``traditional
uses'' or ``claim pending'' approval categories to gather, perform, and submit research information to FDA in order
to reach higher approval levels. 
One comment suggested that FDA allow manufacturers to use facsimiles of the FDA seal in conjunction with the various
ratings. The comment asserted that this approach would encourage manufacturers to come into compliance with FDA
regulations quickly, as the seals would become valuable marketing tools for which consumers look when purchasing
supplements, and the lack of a seal would become a marketing disadvantage for a company. 
FDA has considered these alternative standards and procedures suggested by the comments and finds that none of them
have the characteristics that are necessary to achieve the goal envisioned by Congress in passing the 1990 amendments.
Previously in this preamble the agency concluded that Congress intended that FDA adopt a scientific standard and
a procedure that ensure that health claims that appear in labeling are scientifically valid and understandable.
None of the alternative standards and procedures offered by the comments meets this objective. One of Congress' primary
concerns in passing the 1990 amendments was the widespread use of health claims whose scientific validity had not
been established (Ref. 1). The purpose of the 1990 amendments was to bring that situation under control. The problem
with the alternative procedures offered by the comments is that, rather than bringing the use of claims on dietary
supplements under control, they would ratify the state of affairs that caused Congress to act.
As FDA explained in the preamble of the dietary supplement health claims proposal, a standard for health claims for
dietary supplements that is based only on section 403(a)(1) of the act, or that allows health claims based on the traditional
use of the supplement or the existence of substantial scientific evidence but not significant scientific agreement
about the validity of the claim, would be inconsistent with Congress's desire to ensure that health claims that are
made on dietary supplements, or on any other food, are scientifically valid. FDA pointed out that if such claims were
to be permitted, consumers would be faced with a multitude of claims, some valid and some not valid. FDA stated that
it would be unlikely that consumers could distinguish between valid and invalid claims. Although comments on the
dietary supplement health claims proposal asserted that consumers would not be confused by a multitude of claims,
the comments did not actually go further in addressing how consumers would react to such a situation in food labeling.
More specifically, the comments did not provide data to resolve the question of whether consumers would be able to
understand gradations of scientific reliability of claims on food labeling, or whether consumers would, in fact,
be left as confused as they were before passage of the 1990 amendments. While a number of comments did assert that some
studies show that consumers are able to use various advertising claims about diet and disease in a rational and beneficial
manner, the studies were not actually submitted. In the absence of the studies, FDA has no basis upon which it can evaluate
the assertions of the relevance of the studies to food labeling. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the agency
considers it more likely that consumers would be considerably confused by a multitude of claims with differing degrees
of reliability. One of the purposes of the 1990 amendments was to end such confusion (see statement of Mr. Waxman, 136
Congressional Record H12953 (Ref. 2)). Therefore, FDA rejects this assertion. 
Approaches such as those involving a ``split label'' or the use of an FDA seal would also not be consistent with the congressional
desire for scientific validity because manufacturers would still be able to market dietary supplements with claims
that were not scientifically valid. Even if FDA seals were being used to distinguish those claims that FDA considered
to be valid, there would be a question as to whether consumers would be able to ascertain which claims were preliminary
and which were not. These approaches would not restrict the number of health claims that were of questionable validity,
about which Congress was specifically concerned (Ref. 1). 
Thus, FDA has concluded that it would not be appropriate to adopt any of the alternative approaches suggested by the
comments. 
6. Several comments suggested that FDA adopt the reasonable substantiation standard used by the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) (see FTC Policy Statement Regarding Advertising Substantiation Program (49 FR 30999, August 2, 1984)). The
comments asserted that under this policy, FDA could allow manufacturers to make claims provided that the nature of
the scientific finding is accurately represented, the degree of evidence is not misrepresented, and the claim passes
a rough cost/benefit test. The comments argued that this policy would facilitate harmonization with the FTC regulations
governing the use of health claims in food advertising, would allow consumers to have access to truthful, nonmisleading,
and reliable labeling information, and would still allow FDA to take action against those dietary supplements bearing
health claims that are not properly substantiated. 
Arguments that FDA should adopt for dietary supplements FTC's approach for regulating advertising are not consistent
with Congress' expectations for health claims. While the FTC and FDA are working together to achieve as much consistency
in their approaches to health claims as their respective statutes allow, adoption by FDA of the FTC advertising substantiation
approach would not provide FDA the confidence Congress intended concerning the scientific validity of the claims.
Specifically, as explained above, one of Congress' main purposes in passing the 1990 amendments was to ensure that
health claims made in food labeling are scientifically valid. No such assurance of scientific validity is provided
under the standard that FTC must employ. Under that standard, there must be some evidence to support a claim, but it
need not rise to the level of establishing the claim's validity. Thus, the FTC standard is not adequate for health claims.
In this context, it is appropriate to reiterate FDA's response to comments asserting that it was bound to follow cases
involving FTC's regulation of advertising in the preamble of the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2528):


Although cases involving FTC may sometimes be relevant, it is important to note that fundamental differences exist
between the regulatory schemes administered by the two agencies. Congress has long recognized the division of roles
between the two agencies_FTC concentrates on the interests of commerce and economic needs, whereas the objective
of FDA is ``the health of the people.'' FTC regulates unfair competition and trade practices, including food advertising.
(See, for example, 15 U.S.C. sections 45 and 52.) In contrast, FDA is a scientific agency empowered to regulate the
food label, among other things. Under section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the act, FDA may permit health claims on foods only
if it has determined that those claims meet the statutory test for scientific validity. The laws under which FTC operates
do not include a comparable statutory standard. Thus, it would not be appropriate for FDA to follow the case law involving
FTC. 


III. The Final Regulation


In light of the foregoing, FDA is subjecting dietary supplements to the same standard and procedure that applies to
food in conventional food form. The agency believes that this approach strikes the appropriate balance between the
congressional concern for consumer fraud, public health, and sound science, on the one hand, and the desire to provide
the consumer with information on the other. Thus, the agency is revising   101.14 and 101.70 to include
dietary supplements. 


A. Definitions


In the health claims proposal, FDA proposed definitions for ``health claim,'' ``substance,'' ``nutritive value,''
and ``dietary supplement'' to serve as tools for clearly establishing the scope of the types of claims that would be
subject to the regulations promulgated under section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act. In addition, the agency proposed a
definition for ``disqualifying nutrient levels'' to establish limits on the levels at which certain nutrients that
are known to increase the risk of a disease or health-related condition could be present in a food, and the food would
still be eligible to bear a health claim (see section 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) of the act). 
In the health claims final rule, the agency adopted definitions for the terms ``health claim,'' ``substance,'' ``nutritive
value,'' and ``disqualifying nutrient levels,'' that it revised in response either to comments or to the DS act (see
 101.14(a)(1), (2), (3), and (5)). Also, FDA adopted a definition for the term ``disease or health-related
condition.'' Although the term is used in the definition of ``health claim,'' and the term serves to identify one of
the basic elements of a health claim, the agency had not proposed a definition for it. The agency added this definition
to clarify the coverage of the health claim provisions (see  101.14(a)(6)). Because of the DS act, the agency
reserved the question as to whether these definitions would apply to dietary supplements. The agency also did not
include a definition of ``dietary supplement'' in the final rule because of the moratorium imposed by the DS act. 
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, FDA proposed to adopt the same regulatory scheme for health claims
for dietary supplements that it had established for foods in conventional food form. To effect this tentative decision,
the agency proposed to revise the definition of ``substance'' to make clear that it covers both food in conventional
food form and dietary supplements and to establish a definition for ``dietary supplement.''
FDA received no comments on the former aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting it as proposed. However,
FDA did receive some comments on its proposed definition of ``dietary supplement.'' 


1. Dietary Supplement


FDA proposed the following definition for the term ``dietary supplement'' (proposed  101.14(a)(4)):




Dietary supplement

 means a food, not in conventional food form, that supplies a component to supplement the diet by increasing the total
dietary intake of that component.


In the past, FDA has taken a position that the term ``dietary supplement'' applied only to supplements composed of
essential nutrients. However, FDA did not propose to limit the definition in  101.14(a) in this way because
section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act includes dietary supplements of herbs, substances that generally contain few essential
nutrients. In addition, the legislative history indicates that the term ``other nutritional substances'' could
include a number of substances that have not been shown to be essential or nutrients (Ref. 4). 
7. One comment commended the agency for proposing a definition of ``dietary supplement'' that recognized that these
foods could have components other than substances known to be essential nutrients. The comment asserted that the
proposed definition would appropriately move supplements out of the food additive category. 
FDA advises that the comment's assertion that the definition moves dietary supplements out of the food additive category
is not correct. A dietary supplement, as the definition recognizes, is a compounded food that may include compounds
that are food additives. Whether a component of food is a food additive or not is determined under section 201(s) of
the act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), not section 403(r) of the act. Congress specifically provided in section 9 of the 1990 amendments
that these amendments ``shall not be construed to alter the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
* * * under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.'' Thus, the components of dietary supplements that are food additives
are still fully subject to the food additive requirements under section 409 of the act.
8. A few comments requested that the proposed definition of ``dietary supplement'' be modified to explicitly include
all herbal extracts. One of these comments asserted that the definition should include ``processed or unprocessed
plant parts (bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, and stems) as well as extracts of essential oils, marketed as teas, powders,
tablets, capsules, and elixirs.'' 
FDA is adopting the definition of ``dietary supplement'' as proposed. This definition is intentionally broad to
cover the range of substances that, under the legislative history, could be included in a dietary supplement and could
be the subject of a health claim. The purpose of the definition of ``dietary supplement'' is not to define the substances
that may be eligible to be the subject of a health claim but to define the form in which they are to be sold to be subject
to regulation as a ``dietary supplement.'' Under the scheme that FDA is adopting, and that Congress envisioned (see
Ref. 4, statement of Senator Metzenbaum), the determination as to what substances are appropriately the subject
of a health claim is made on a case-by-case basis, based on the factors set out in  101.14(b) and the evidence presented
to the agency. The agency disagrees with the comment in one respect, however. Teas are food in conventional food form
and thus not included within the definition of ``dietary supplement.''
9. One comment asserted the definition of ``dietary supplement'' should include foods in conventional food form
that are fortified with a vitamin or mineral to a level of 50 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) per serving
(e.g., many breakfast cereals).
FDA does not agree that such foods should be included in the definition of ``dietary supplements.'' As discussed in
the preamble to the dietary supplement proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33707), FDA has limited this definition to foods not
in conventional food form to reflect the approach taken by Congress in the DS act. The manager's statements for the
DS act from the Senate and the House (Ref. 3) clearly state that the moratorium on the implementation of the 1990 amendments
applies only to dietary supplements ``not in the form of conventional food.'' Because foods in conventional food
form were not covered by the DS act moratorium, the health claims regulations already apply to them. Consequently,
FDA believes that it will reduce confusion about the impact of these regulations if the agency limits coverage of the
term ``dietary supplements'' to foods not in conventional food form. Of course, foods in conventional food form that
are formulated to supplement the dietary intake of nutrients will be free to reflect their characteristics in their
common or usual name (e.g., vitamin and mineral supplement cereal). 


2. Nutritive Value


In the health claims final rule, FDA defined ``nutritive value'' as follows: 



Nutritive value 

 means a value in sustaining human existence by such processes as promoting growth, replacing loss of essential nutrients,
or providing energy.


Although FDA did not propose any changes in the definition of ``nutritive value'' in the dietary supplement health
claims proposal, many comments expressed concern about the impact of this definition in conjunction with the preliminary
requirement in  101.14(b)(3)(i) that the substance that is the subject of a health claim contribute taste,
aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in  170(o), and that the substance must retain that
attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim. (Preliminary requirements are criteria
in  101.14(b) that have to be met before a substance will qualify to be the subject of a health claim. An indepth
discussion of all preliminary requirements follows in section III.B. of this document.) 
10. Some comments urged the agency to broaden its definition of ``nutritive value.'' These comments urged the agency
to recognize that the processes by which a nutrient promotes health, maintains proper bodily functioning, and protects
the body from the development of chronic disease or other health-related conditions are, in and of themselves, characteristic
of ``nutritive value.'' The comments noted that the basic function of Vitamin E, for example, relates to its antioxidant
properties in preventing cell damage by trapping peroxyl free radicals and inhibiting the oxidation of unsaturated
fatty acids. Also, the comments pointed out that fiber does not promote growth, replace essential nutrients, or provide
energy, but that Congress specifically required FDA to study the relationship between various diseases and fiber.
Some of the comments asked that the phrase ``preventing or repairing the negative metabolic consequences of life
processes'' be added to the list of processes that characterize the nutritive value of a food to ensure that such components
can be the subject of health claims. A few comments asserted that FDA should revise the definition of ``nutritive value''
to provide for claims about ``prevention'' of a disease or health-related condition. 
However, one comment maintained that the definition of ``nutritive value'' in  101.14(a)(3) is broad enough
to include the functions of most dietary supplements. The comment supported its position by agreeing with FDA's statement
in the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2488) that the inclusion of the phrase ``such as'' in the definition ensures
that the three referenced processes are examples of how a substance may confer nutritive value rather than as an all-inclusive
list. 
The comment that highlighted FDA's use of the phrase ``such processes as'' in this definition is correct. FDA intended
the three referenced processes to be examples of how a substance may confer nutritive value rather than as an all-inclusive
list of the functions that provide such value. As FDA explained in the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2488),
the definition of ``nutritive value'' is intended to be very flexible. The agency incorporated this flexibility
in the definition because FDA recognizes that certain substances can play a major role in reducing the risk of certain
chronic diseases and may confer their benefits through a number of processes. FDA believes that the agency should
evaluate the nutritive value claimed for a substance that is proposed as the subject of a health claim, as described
in a health claim petition, on a case-by-case basis. This approach will best ensure that the definition retains its
intended flexibility and does not become an unintentional barrier to authorization for legitimate health claims.

FDA does believe, however, that this preamble should provide guidance concerning how the agency will determine if
a claimed nutrient-disease relationship derives from the nutritive value of a substance. In general, the agency
will look for evidence that the claimed effect on disease is associated with the normal maintenance of human existence.
If the substance is used to correct an abnormal physiological function caused by a disease or health-related condition,
the action of the substance is clearly beyond a normal maintenance function, and the health benefit would therefore
not derive from the substance's nutritive value. Such a substance would be a drug. (Note also that claims about classical
nutrient deficiency diseases are not health claims (see 58 FR 2478 at 2481).) 
FDA recognizes that many of the benefits mentioned in the comments may derive from the nutritional value of a substance.
The agency's broad definition of ``nutritive value'' includes assisting in the efficient functioning of classical
nutritional processes and of other metabolic processes necessary for the normal maintenance of human existence.
Dietary fiber, for example, helps to assure normal intestinal transit time, thereby providing nutritional value
by promoting efficient bowel function. Vitamin E provides nutritive value through its antioxidant function of reduction
of cell damage.
With respect to assertions that FDA should revise the definition of ``nutritive value'' to provide for claims about
``prevention'' of a disease or health-related condition, the agency points out that the preamble of the health claims
final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2501 through 2502) fully addressed this matter and concluded that a claim that a substance
can be used in the prevention, diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of a disease or symptom is inappropriate
for a food (see section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act and  101.9(k)(1) (21 U.S.C. 101.9(k)(1))). FDA reached this
conclusion because the relationship of a food or a food component to a disease is quite different from that of a drug.
The comments making these assertions did not provide any basis upon which FDA could conclude that the agency's position
in this matter should be different for dietary supplements than for foods in conventional food form. As FDA explained
in the preamble of the health claims final rule, the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health (Ref. 5) points
out that, apart from classic disorders resulting from dietary deficiencies of essential nutrients (e.g., pellagra
and niacin), it has proved difficult to demonstrate causal associations between specific dietary factors and chronic
or other diseases (e.g., dietary fiber and cancer). The report states:


Development of the major chronic disease conditions_coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer_is affected
by multiple genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors among which diet is only one_albeit an important_component.
These other factors interact with diet in ways that are not completely understood. In addition, foods themselves
are complex; they may contain some factors that promote disease as well as others that are protective. The relationship
of dietary fat intake to causation of atherosclerotic heart disease is a prominent example. An excess intake of total
fat, if characterized by high saturated fat, is associated with high blood cholesterol levels and therefore an increased
risk for coronary heart disease in many populations. A higher proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated fats in relation
to saturated fats is associated with lower blood cholesterol levels and, therefore, with a reduced risk for coronary
heart disease.
Because of these complexities, definitive scientific proof that specific dietary factors are responsible for specific
chronic disease conditions is difficult_and may not be possible_to obtain, given available technology. 


(Ref. 5).


11. Several comments argued that the definition of ``nutritive value'' should include levels of nutrients that are
achievable only through the use of fortified foods or dietary supplements. Several of these comments referenced
studies recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that indicate that vitamin E reduces the risk of heart
disease when consumed at levels that are almost impossible to achieve through a conventional diet but that can be easily
and safely attained through the use of dietary supplements. These comments asserted that it would be inappropriate
for FDA to categorize the involved nutrient levels of vitamin E as therapeutic and to refuse to consider approving
a health claim simply because the claim concerns levels of a nutrient above that achievable in a normal daily diet.
A few of the comments supported this assertion by noting that the mechanism by which Vitamin E protects against cell
damage when consumed at normal dietary levels is identical to the mechanism by which it protects against heart disease
when consumed at higher levels. The comments maintained that, in cases such as this one, the agency should approve
health claims for use strictly on dietary supplements, provided that the nutrient is safe when consumed at the level
at which the claimed effect is achieved, and the supplement is intended to be consumed to optimize health rather than
as a drug. The comments supported this regulatory approach by noting that the health benefits of calcium occur when
the nutrient is consumed at increased levels that can be achieved through the diet or by supplementation and stating
that vitamin E should not be treated differently simply because the beneficial levels cannot be reached without the
use of dietary supplements. 
Similar comments argued that FDA should at least avoid establishing a maximum level of a nutrient that is considered
to be characteristic of ``nutritive value.'' One of these comments noted such an approach results in an extremely
fuzzy line, because the maximum level of a nutrient that is achievable in a diet varies widely from one individual to
another. As an example, the comment pointed out that a person who eats ten oranges or drinks a quart of orange juice per
day gets more vitamin C than is provided by most currently marketed vitamin C supplements. A few comments asserted
that there is much scientific disagreement over what levels of a nutrient are ``nutritive,'' with many scientists
contending that levels much higher than the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances (U.S. RDA) fall within the definition.
A few comments requested that FDA explicitly express in its regulations a policy that nutritive value may involve
relatively high levels of a nutrient. 
A few comments maintained that FDA should presume that all nutrients function in a nutritive manner regardless of
their level, unless it has proof to the contrary. In support of this position, a number of comments objected to the use
of niacin's effect on blood cholesterol levels in the dietary supplement proposal as an example of an effect that is
not nutritive. One of these comments questioned FDA's assertion that niacin does not exhibit cholesterol-reducing
properties when ingested at the levels conventionally associated with its function as a vitamin. The comment stated
that niacin's vitamin effect occurs below the level of tissue saturation and maintained that the excretion of niacin
when consumed at higher levels known to be associated with cholesterol-lowering effects does not necessarily indicate
that tissue saturation has occurred. This comment also disagreed with the agency's statement that the occurrence
of liver damage when high levels of niacin are consumed indicates that the effect of niacin at these levels is not nutritive
in nature. The comment argued that it is quite possible that niacin continues to have nutritive effects at these levels
but simply is overloading the body's normal metabolic pathways for ridding itself of excessive levels of the nutrient.
The comment asserted that while legitimate safety concerns exist in particular cases of excessive nutrient intake,
FDA should not use this fact to conclude that high levels of those nutrients are inherently nonnutritive in nature
and are instead pharmacological. 
Other comments expressed the belief that nothing in the proposed regulations would automatically exclude high levels
of nutrients from the definition of ``nutritive value'' and urged the agency to include such levels in instances where
they would benefit the public health. These comments also agreed with FDA's decision to review on a case-by-case basis
whether the amount of a substance is appropriate as the subject of a health claim. One of these comments stated that
such an approach would help to ensure that health information about fortified foods and dietary supplements can be
conveyed without triggering the drug regulations. 
FDA does not believe that it is necessary for the rules to explicitly state that nutritive value includes relatively
high levels of a nutrient. As some comments pointed out, the case-by-case approach, which, as stated above, is intrinsically
linked with the preliminary requirement in the provisions of 
 101.14(b)(3)(i), provides the agency with considerable flexibility with respect to high levels of substances
in dietary supplements. Under this approach, FDA has not, as a general rule, established any maximum level at which
a nutrient would cease to have ``nutritive value.'' Furthermore, the agency advises that there is no basis for concerns
that FDA would use safety concerns alone to conclude that high levels of nutrients are pharmacological. FDA will not
do so.
As some of the comments pointed out, petitions for claims that require that high levels of substances be ingested should
have no problem demonstrating that the substance has nutritive value where the mechanism by which the substance affects
the risk of disease at these high levels is the same as the mechanism by which it functions as a nutrient at normal dietary
levels. However, it will still be necessary, as the agency explained in response to the previous comment, for the petition
to show that the substance's effect on disease is associated with the normal functioning of the human body (e.g., the
substance could not be used to correct an abnormal physiological function caused by a disease or health-related condition.)

In its response to the previous comment, the agency acknowledged that vitamin E provides nutritive value through
its antioxidant function of reduction of cell damage. If there are situations where it can be established that this
same antioxidant mechanism affects the risk of disease when the vitamin is consumed at levels significantly higher
than normal dietary levels, such levels would satisfy the requirement in  101.14(b)(3)(i) that a substance
retain its food attribute (i.e., its nutritive value) when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim.

FDA does not agree, however, that it should presume that all nutrients function in a nutritive manner, regardless
of their level, unless it has proof to the contrary. It would not be practicable for the agency to bear the burden of determining
the mechanism by which the claimed effect is occurring for each petitioned claim. Thus, the agency finds that it is
appropriate to require that petitioners provide the basis for why it is reasonable to conclude that the claimed effect
is nutritional and not pharmacological. However, the agency does not necessarily expect absolute proof on this issue.
FDA will evaluate petitions on this issue on a case-by-case basis. 
The agency has considered assertions that the dietary supplement proposal should not have cited the cholesterol-reducing
properties of niacin as an example of a high dose effect that is not nutritive. FDA has again concluded that niacin is
an appropriate example because there are significant indications that a nutritive mechanism is not responsible
for the cholesterol-lowering effect that occurs with high levels of niacin intake. When FDA stated in the dietary
supplement proposal that levels of niacin necessary to produce the cholesterol-lowering effect are far in excess
of the levels at which there is tissue saturation for niacin's vitamin function, the agency was attempting to explain
that for niacin's function as a vitamin there is a level beyond which additional niacin will not provide additional
functional results for that vitamin. The term ``tissue saturation'' may imply either this type of situation (sometimes
referred to as ``function saturation'') or the type of situation referred to in one of the comments wherein the tissue
is saturated with a concentration of a substance, and more substance could immediately spill out into the urine. FDA
was not attempting to assert that the tissue itself was actually saturated. There is no question that additional niacin
will be absorbed by cells when the vitamin function saturation level is reached. 
In addition to the situation with vitamin function saturation, there are other indications that the cholesterol-reducing
properties of niacin do not result from the same mechanism as that presented by its vitamin function. Vitamin function
saturation may be achieved through dietary supplementation with either of the two forms of the vitamin, nicotinic
acid or nicotinamide. However, only nicotinic acid provides, at high levels, the cholesterol-reducing effects.
Such effects do not appear with high level consumption of nicotinamide (Ref. 6). If the same mechanism were involved
with the vitamin function of niacin as with the cholesterol-reducing properties of niacin, both forms of this vitamin
should have cholesterol-reducing properties. 


3. Health Claim


In the dietary supplement health claim proposal, FDA did not propose to make any modifications in the definition of
``health claim'' in  101.14(a)(1):


Health claim means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly
or by implication, including ``third party'' references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term
such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance
to a disease or health-related condition. Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes,
or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship
exists between the presence or level of any substance in the food and a disease or health-related condition.
Nonetheless, FDA received several comments on this definition.


12. Some comments asserted that FDA should clarify the types of statements that will be regulated as health claims.
A few of these comments asked whether statements that indicate that a product may be useful in maintaining good health
(e.g., ``Substance X may be beneficial to good health'') or that describe the biochemical functions of vitamins,
minerals, and other nutrients (e.g., ``Vitamin A is necessary for good eyesight,'' ``Protein helps build a strong
body'') will be considered to be health claims. The comments objected to FDA's failure to provide clear instruction
in this regard. These comments asserted that the agency's allowance of case-by-case interpretation of the regulations
will hinder industry compliance, create enforcement problems for the agency, and cause continued antagonism between
FDA and the food industry. 
FDA believes that it provided ample guidance on what types of statements constitute health claims in the health claims
final rule. As the agency explained in the preamble of that rule (58 FR 2478 at 2479 through 2488), the definition establishes
that a claim must have at least two basic elements for it to be regulated as a ``health claim.'' First, the claim must
be about a ``substance'' as defined in  101.14(a)(2). Secondly, the claim must characterize the relationship
of that substance to a ``disease or health-related condition,'' as defined in  101.14(a)(6): 




Disease or health-related condition

 means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular
disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting
from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition (claims pertaining
to such diseases are thereby not subject to 101.14 or 101.70).
If a statement has one of these elements without the other, it would not be a ``health claim,'' although it may still
be subject to regulation under other provisions of the act (e.g., the requirement of section 403(a)(1) of the act that
a label statement be truthful and not misleading). Thus, all of the statements mentioned by the comments would not
be health claims because they do not address a disease or health-related condition as defined under  101.14(a)(6).
The agency has provided a lengthy and detailed discussion on what types of statements constitute health claims in
the health claims final rule at the pages cited above.


12. A few comments asked whether FDA would remove or prohibit the publishing of books containing information on health
claims and argued that such regulations would clearly be unconstitutional. Other comments addressed the issue of
whether FDA's health claims regulations for dietary supplements would apply to advertising. One of these comments
interpreted an excerpt from the report of FDA's Task Force on Dietary Supplements as an attempt to disallow the use
of unapproved health claims in magazines, newsletters, or other media channels unless the information has been preapproved
by FDA. That excerpt reads:


The task force considered various issues in its deliberations, including how to assure the safety of dietary supplements;
how to limit the potential for fraud, i.e., disease claims made on labels or through other means, e.g., magazine articles,
newsletters, and advertisements * * *.


The comment further asserted that this same intent is reflected in the health claim regulations proposed in November
1991. The comment stated that this broad-based application of the health claims regulations would severely jeopardize
the reporting of health and disease-related information in almost every form of media, would inhibit the evolution
of scientific knowledge, would have a significant negative impact on the public health of America, and was likely
unconstitutional.
FDA advises that the provisions of this regulation pertain only to a product's label and labeling. This regulation
does nothing to censor the content of books, magazines, or advertising. This regulation also does not in any way regulate
the availability of books, magazines, or advertising. However, firms sometimes choose to use such material as labeling
for their products, and if used as such, the material would be subject to this regulation. For example, sometimes firms
copy an article from a magazine and display that article with a product that is offered for sale. Under such circumstances,
the article would be a part of the labeling of that product. What is significant to note is that these regulations in
no way limit what articles may be published, or what books may be printed. They limit only the claims that may be made
in the labeling of food products. Under the act, advertising may provide objective evidence of what the intended use
of a particular product is. If the advertising reveals that the product is intended to be used as a drug, the product
may be regulated as a drug. In addition, claims made in advertising may affect the type of nutrition labeling that is
provided (see  101.9(j)). Claims made in advertising, however, are not subject to section 403(r)(1)(B) of
the act. 
Thus, the agency finds no merit in the concerns expressed by these comments.


B. Preliminary Requirements for a Claim


In the health claims final rule, FDA established several criteria in  101.14(b) that have to be met before a substance
will qualify to be the subject of a health claim. The criteria provide that the substance must: (1) Be associated with
a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population is at risk (alternatively, the relevance
of the claim may be explained within the context of the daily diet) (see 
 101.14(b)(1)); (2) be a food (see  101.14(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i)); and (3) be safe and lawful under applicable
food safety provisions of the act (see  101.14(b)(3)(ii)). These criteria reflect not only the requirements
of section 403(r) of the act but also the fact that FDA is charged with ensuring that the food supply is safe, and that
the food label is not misleading. Given that agency evaluations of the validity of a health claim will be resource intensive,
FDA decided not to undertake such evaluations unless a petition for a health claim demonstrates that the preliminary
requirements are met. While FDA had proposed in November of 1991 that these preliminary requirements cover substances
in dietary supplements as well as foods in conventional food form, the provisions of the DS act precluded the agency
from applying these preliminary requirements to substances in dietary supplements at the time that the rule was finalized.
Thus, the preliminary requirements established in the health claims final rule apply only to substances in foods
in conventional food form. 
The dietary supplement health claim proposal contained provisions to subject the components of dietary supplements
to the same preliminary requirements in  101.14(b) that apply to any other substance that is proposed as the
subject of a health claim. This final rule for dietary supplements retains these provisions as proposed. Specific
reference to dietary supplements in  101.14(b)(1) and (b)(2) is not necessary because the requirements in
these paragraphs apply generally to any ``substance,'' and FDA's revision of the definition of ``substance'' in
 101.14(a)(2) includes the components of dietary supplements within the coverage of this term. However, FDA
proposed to add a specific reference to dietary supplements to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of  101.14 to clarify that
the substance may be a component of a food that is in the form of a dietary supplement. The only comments on the issue agreed
with the agency's proposed revision. Accordingly, as proposed, FDA is including in the final regulations a reference
to dietary supplements in the codified language of  101.14(b)(3)(i). Specifically, FDA is inserting the phrase
``regardless of whether the food is in conventional food form or dietary supplement form'' into  101.14(b)(3)(i).



1. Effect on General Population


13. One comment argued that the proposed requirement that a substance be associated with a disease or health-related
condition for which the general U.S. population or a subpopulation thereof is at risk, or that the claim be explained
within the context of the daily diet, would prohibit the appearance of health claims on herbal dietary supplements.
However, the comment did not explain how the requirement would have this effect, and the comment's own analysis of
how garlic would or would not meet various proposed requirements indicated that garlic would meet this particular
requirement. 
FDA does not agree that this preliminary requirement will present any significant barriers to the appearance of health
claims on dietary supplements. To the contrary, as the agency explained in the preamble of the health claims final
rule (58 FR 2478 at 2499), FDA intends to employ a flexible approach in interpreting this provision. The alternative
aspect of the provision, which creates the possibility of claims about the relationship of a substance to a disease
or health related-condition that affects very few in the U.S. population as long as the petition in support of the claim
addresses that fact and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet, evidences a determination
by FDA to provide the widest latitude possible for proposed claims to qualify under this provision. 
14. One comment requested that FDA not limit the diseases or health-related conditions that may be the subject of a
health claim to those for which the entire United States is at potential risk. The comment asserted that health claims
should also be allowed in cases where dietary factors have been conclusively shown to affect diseases or health-related
conditions for which only a particular subportion of the U.S. population is at risk (e.g., ovarian cancer in women).

FDA advises that the general eligibility provisions of its health claims regulations in  101.14(b)(1) do not
contain the restriction cited by the comment. While these provisions contain a requirement that health claims pertain
to diseases or health-related conditions affecting the general U.S. population, they also provide that health claims
may pertain to diseases or health-related conditions for which an identified subgroup of the U.S. population is at
risk. Thus, ovarian cancer in women would clearly be an appropriate subject of a health claim. 


2. Components of Food Within the Context of a Daily Diet


The preliminary requirement that a substance that is to be the subject of a health claim must be a food appears in  
101.14(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i). If the substance is present at decreased dietary levels, under  101.14(b)(2),
it must be a nutrient that is required to be included in nutrition labeling (e.g., cholesterol, total fat). If the substance
is present at other than decreased dietary levels, under  101.14(b)(3)(i), it: (1) Must contribute taste,
aroma, or nutritive value, or any other technical effect listed in  170.3(o), to the food and (2) must retain
that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim. 
15. Numerous comments expressed concern about the aspect of the preliminary requirement of  101.14(b)(3)(i)
that requires that a substance contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in  170.3(o),
in view of the agency's definition of ``nutritive value'' in  101.14(a)(3). A number of these comments characterized
these provisions as an attack by the agency against dietary supplements. Some comments asserted that the proposed
preliminary requirement would prohibit dietary supplements, especially those containing herbs, from bearing
health claims. Comments pointed out that many herbs, such as garlic, are specially processed to remove the flavor
or odor from the final supplement product. A number of comments explained that such supplements would fail to meet
this requirement because their beneficial effects on the body often are derived from substances unique to the plant
that do not promote growth, replace loss of essential nutrients, or provide energy. A few comments also noted that
many herbs contain insignificant amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. 
Some comments asserted that the adoption of any preliminary requirement that would automatically disqualify herbal
dietary supplements from bearing health claims would undermine the intent of Congress to establish a nondrug review
process for health claims involving herbs. These comments asserted that the 1990 amendments clearly provide that
herbal dietary supplements can be the topic of a health claim. Furthermore, a comment asserted that the Court of Appeals
held in 

Nutrilab, Inc.

 v. 

Schweiker

, 713 F.2d 335, 338 (7th Cir. 1983) that some products, such as prune juice or coffee, may be consumed for reasons other
than taste, aroma, or nutritive value.
One comment asserted that all dietary supplements already meet the this preliminary requirement. The comment noted
that a substance to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels may also be shown to be a food by contributing
any technical effect listed in  170.3(o). The comment stated that  170.3(o)(20) lists one of those technical
effects as nutrient supplementation and broadly defines a ``nutrient supplement'' as ``substances which are necessary
for the body's nutritional and metabolic processes.''
FDA does not believe that it is overly restrictive to require, as it does in  101.14(b)(3)(i), that a substance
be a food or a component of food for it to be the subject of a health claim. Section 403 of the act, which includes the health
claims provisions, states, ``A food shall be deemed to be misbranded * * *'' (emphasis added). Thus, section 403(r)
of the act describes the circumstances in which a food will, and will not be, misbranded if it bears a health claim. It
is therefore appropriate for the agency to make it incumbent on the proponent of a health claim to demonstrate that
the substance that is to be the subject of the claim is a food or component of food. 
FDA disagrees with the comments' interpretation of the 

Nutrilab

 decision. As FDA explained in the preamble of the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2499-2500), the 

Nutrilab

 court adopted a ``common sense'' definition of ``food'' under section 201(f)(1) of the act: ``When the statute defines
`food' as `articles used for food,' it means that the statutory definition of `food' includes articles used by people
in the ordinary way most people use food_primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value.'' 

Nutrilab

, 713 F.2d at 338. Other courts have followed suit. 

See

 

United States

 v. 

Undetermined Quantities of Cal-Ban 3000

, 776 F. Supp. 249, 254-55 (E.D.N.C. 1991); 

American Health Products Co.

 v. 

Hayes

, 574 F. Supp. 1498, 1508-09 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), 

aff'd

, 744 F.2d 912 (2d Cir. 1984). By describing taste, aroma, and nutritive value as the ``primary'' reasons for consuming
food, the 

Nutrilab

 court acknowledged that a food consumed for one of these reasons might sometimes also be consumed for an additional
purpose (713 F.2d at 338 (giving prune juice and coffee as examples of foods that ``may be consumed on occasion for reasons
other than taste, aroma, or nutritive value'')). Under 

Nutrilab

, however, a substance whose uses do not include taste, aroma, or nutritive value is not a food.
In  101.14(b)(3)(i), FDA incorporated this common sense definition of food and the phrase ``or any technical
effect listed in  170.3(o),'' which reflects the fact that the definition of ``food'' in section 201(f)(3)
of the act includes ``articles used for components of food,'' as a preliminary requirement to ensure that a substance
that is to be the subject of a health claim is in fact a food. This preliminary requirement is fundamental because both
the component of a food that is the subject of a health claim and a component of a drug have a characterizable relationship
to a disease. Congress recognized this fact by creating an exception from section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act, in the definition
of ``drug'' for foods that bear a claim authorized under section 403(r) of the act. Thus, it is crucial to the continuing
viability of the act itself that the choice of the test that determines whether a claim that characterizes the relationship
of a substance to a disease can be made be based on the appropriate factors. Under the act, that choice turns in part on
whether the substance is a food. Therefore, FDA has reflected in  101.14(b)(3)(i) the judicially recognized
characteristics of a food.
In this regard, interested persons should not presume that inclusion of the phrase ``or any technical effect listed
in 
 170.3(o)'' in  101.14(b)(3)(i) means that substances that may be classified within one or more of the
categories of food additives in  170.3(o) automatically meet this preliminary requirement. The classifications
within  170.3(o) are of a general nature to reflect the uses to which food ingredients are put. All of the classifications
pertain to the effect of the ingredients on food (e.g., by affecting the texture of the food) rather than on the human
body. Only a substance that is used for the technical effect in  170.3(o)(20), that of a nutrient supplement,
has the potential to have a useful effect in the body because of the characteristics that cause it to be used in the food.
The ``nutrient supplement'' category includes ``Substances which are necessary for the body's nutritional and
metabolic processes.'' As the comments themselves recognized, not every component of a dietary supplement has such
an effect.
In view of the agency's broad, flexible definition of ``nutritive value,'' FDA does not find any merit in arguments
that the provisions requiring that a substance be a food should be removed. To the contrary, FDA believes that these
provisions will benefit the public health by allowing the agency to devote its limited resources for review of petitions
to those that are appropriate for consideration under the health claim provisions of the act. Accordingly, FDA considers
these provisions essential elements under the framework that it has created in its regulations for the regulation
of health claims and fully consistent with the act. 
FDA disagrees with the comments' characterization of its actions as an attack against dietary supplements. FDA believes
that the combined effect of  101.14(b)(3)(i), the preliminary requirement that a substance be a food, and  101.14(a)(3),
the definition of ``nutritive value,'' will not present dietary supplements with any unreasonable barriers for
agency evaluation of potential health claims for components of these products. Without question, these provisions
do restrict health claims to effects on a disease or a health-related condition resulting from the nutritive value
of substances. However, as one comment pointed out, the current definition of ``nutritive value'' in  101.14(a)(3)
is broad enough to include the functions of most dietary supplements.
One observation that might bear making in this context is that Congress has given the agency a statutory structure
with which to deal. In relevant part, that structure divides the world of substances that have a relationship to disease
into foods and drugs. Congress placed the health claims provisions on the food side of the ledger. FDA is charged with
implementing those provisions in accordance with the act and applicable legal precedents. FDA has announced its
intention to implement the health claim provisions as flexibly as possible, but at some point the agency simply cannot
be as flexible as some of the comments have suggested. At that point, the agency would start to erode the scheme that
the statute has established for drugs. The agency cannot do that. If Congress intended something that goes beyond
the scheme that FDA has established in these final regulations, then what is required is a change in the law itself.
16. Many comments objected to the aspect of  101.14(b)(3)(i) that requires that a substance retain its food
status (i.e., its nutritive value) when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim. Almost all concern
was directed toward consumption of substances at levels significantly higher than those present in the daily diet.
Some comments urged FDA to evaluate proposed health claims involving relatively high levels of nutrients on the grounds
that categorically prohibiting them would deny Americans beneficial information rather than educating them on
how to alter their diets to achieve optimal health. Other comments stated that FDA's categorical refusal to evaluate
such health claims because of the nutrient levels involved would directly violate both the Proxmire Amendment and
the congressional intent behind the 1990 amendments. These comments noted that the 1990 amendments provide for the
appearance of health claims on foods and stated that, subject to certain conditions, the Proxmire Amendment's prohibition
against regulating a vitamin supplement as a drug ``solely because it exceeds the level of potency which the Secretary
determines is nutritionally rational or useful'' guarantees the regulation of vitamins as foods regardless of the
levels of nutrients that they supply. The comments also stated that Congress envisioned the approval of such health
claims, as it was aware that dietary supplements substantially in excess of the U.S. RDA's were routinely being consumed
by Americans, and it chose to direct that FDA conduct a review of antioxidant vitamins/cancer claims with dietary
supplements in mind. Other comments further asserted that FDA was attempting to circumvent the Proxmire Amendment
and create maximum potency levels for all supplements by establishing an upper limit for ``nutritive value.'' 
FDA does not agree that any conflict with section 411 of the act is presented by a requirement that, to be the subject
of a health claim, the substance must be a food, that is, consumed primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value.
There is nothing in the health claims final rule or in the regulations established by this document that will affect
in any way the availability of dietary supplements or consumers' freedom to choose to purchase them. Rather, the regulations
that FDA is establishing are intended to ensure that any health claims that may be made for dietary supplements are
scientifically valid. This is what section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act directs FDA to do.
Nothing in these regulations would necessarily prevent a supplement from bearing a health claim when it contains
a level of a substance that exceeds the level achievable in the context of the daily diet. To the contrary, the final
rule concerning calcium and osteoporosis, for example, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2665), permits a calcium health claim for dietary supplements and requires only that the supplement
labeling advise consumers, in appropriate circumstances, that there is no known benefit from consuming more than
200 percent of the recommended daily intake for calcium. 
Section 411 of the act does not authorize health claims for dietary supplements or in any way affect FDA's authority
under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act to regulate such claims. Under section 411(a)(1)(B) of the act, FDA may not classify
a dietary supplement as a drug solely because it contains a vitamin or mineral at a level that exceeds the level of potency
that the agency determines is nutritionally rational or useful. Nothing in these proposed regulations would do so.
Absent a claim, FDA will not consider a dietary supplement to be a drug because it contains vitamins or minerals at levels
above those normally found in food. However, a claim on a product is an indication of the product's intended use. If
a claim reveals that the product is intended for a use other than for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value, then nothing
in section 411 of the act would require that it be treated as a food. 
17. Many comments addressed the circumstances under which dietary supplements should be considered drugs. A number
of these comments referred to the following agency statement in the health claims final rule (comment 49, 58 FR 2478
at 2501): 


A product that is intended for medicinal effects, that is, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
or prevention of disease, is a drug and not a food. Thus, there is no basis under the act for FDA to permit health claims
for herbs whose only known use is for medicinal effects. Health benefits of such herbs may appear in the labeling only
in accordance with the drug provisions of the act. 


Although a few comments agreed with this statement, many comments expressed categorical opposition to the classification
of any herbs or other dietary supplements as drugs. While most of these comments did not offer reasons in support of
their position, one comment expressed concern that such a policy would be grounds for FDA to categorically ban all
such supplements as unapproved new drugs. Several comments noted that many herbs have traditionally been used both
as foods and drugs and asked for assurance that FDA would not automatically regulate such herbs as drugs. Other comments
argued that herbs should always be regulated as foods where they are consumed for their nutritive value. 
Some comments stressed that intended use, as stated on its labeling, should be the determinative factor in deciding
whether a supplement should be regulated as a food or as a drug. As an example, one of these comments stated that a supplement
marketed for a specific therapeutic use (e.g., a vitamin C tablet sold to cure cancer) is appropriately regarded as
a drug, while a supplement sold to be taken over a period of time to reduce the risk of developing a disease (e.g., a vitamin
C tablet sold to be taken daily to reduce the risk of cancer) should be regulated as a food. The comment asserted that
this approach is consistent with FDA's determination that a supplement containing large amounts of niacin should
be regulated as a drug when consumed to lower serum cholesterol. Another of these comments emphasized that a consumer's
use of a legally labeled product should not have any weight in determining whether that product is a drug. As an example,
the comment noted that FDA does not regulate either fiber or water as a drug as long as their labeling does not bear drug
claims, even though consumers may use them to facilitate bowel movement or to prevent, mitigate, or treat 
dehydration, respectively. 
A few comments suggested that FDA determine whether a substance is a food or a drug by its chemical composition. The
comments asserted that while the boundary between drugs and supplements is fuzzy at times, drugs are typically synthetic
molecules that are of a unique and patentable nature, while dietary supplements consist of natural, nonpatentable
materials.
Another comment stated that FDA should exempt substances taken to treat a symptom of a disease from regulation as drugs,
as the act defines as drugs only those substances used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
of the disease itself. 
Earlier in this preamble, FDA explained that these regulations do not affect the availability of dietary supplements.
Again, these regulations affect only the food label and food labeling. FDA has no intention of banning all dietary
supplements of herbs or similar substances as unapproved new drugs. FDA will carry out its responsibility to regulate
inappropriate claims, but the agency will not attempt to restrict the sale of dietary supplements to consumers unless
the supplements present safety concerns.
With respect to the specific words for use in labeling statements, FDA advises that statements that a product may be
effective in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease will make the product a drug. However, statements
that a product may reduce the risk of developing a disease or health-related condition may, or may not, make the product
a drug. Exactly how a substance-disease relationship is to be characterized is one of the issues that the agency will
address in deciding whether to authorize a health claim and how to ensure that the claim describes the significance
of the substance in affecting the disease or health-related condition. FDA points out that as a general matter, merely
using terms such as ``reduce the risk'' instead of ``prevent'' will not automatically make a claim a health claim and
not a drug claim. FDA will make a case-by-case assessment based on all relevant factors in determining whether a claim
is appropriately subject to the health claims regime. The agency also agrees that the main focus in deciding whether
a product is subject to regulation as a food or a drug is the intent of the vendor and not how consumers use the product
(although how consumers understand claims that are made can be used to determine vendor intent). 
FDA advises that there is no provision in the act for the agency to exempt statements about symptoms of disease from
causing products to be regulated as drugs. Although such statements may not be claims that the product will treat the
disease that causes the symptoms, the statements clearly pertain to the mitigation of disease by addressing the symptoms
caused by the disease. Section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act provides, in part, that articles intended for use in the mitigation
of disease are drugs. Similarly, there is no provision in the act for FDA to exempt natural, nonpatentable materials
from the definition of a drug in section 201(g) of the act. 
FDA advises that it not true that all natural materials are not drugs. It has been estimated that about 25 percent of
the drugs currently prescribed by physicians are plant compounds, and that an additional 25 percent are related to
plants. Therefore, fully half of the drugs commonly used can be considered plant derived. Such commonly used drugs
as digitalis, aspirin, quinidine, atropine, and hundreds of others were once considered herbals. Thus, the agency
finds that it cannot rely on the distinction of whether a product is natural or synthetic in deciding whether it is a
food or a drug. 


3. Safety


Section 101.14(b)(3)(ii) provides that, to justify a claim for a substance that is to be consumed at other than decreased
levels, the substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary
to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim, to FDA's satisfaction, to be safe and lawful
under the applicable food safety provisions of the act.
The preamble of the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33709) explained:


* * * This showing can be based on: (1) A demonstration that the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) within
the meaning of  170.30; (2) a listing of the substance as GRAS in 21 CFR Part 182 or as affirmed as GRAS in 21 CFR Part
184; (3) a food additive regulation; or (4) a sanction or approval granted by FDA or the United States Department of
Agriculture prior to September 6, 1958. If the safety and lawfulness of the substance is not expressly recognized
in an FDA regulation, the burden will rest on the claim's proponent, as a prerequisite to FDA's evaluation of the health
claim, to submit all the scientific data and other relevant information required to demonstrate safety and lawfulness
in accordance with applicable petition requirements. FDA will withhold review of the health claim until it is satisfied
on these points.


18. Many comments objected that the proposed safety provisions are unreasonable. A few of these comments specifically
asserted that herbal supplements would almost universally fail the proposed safety requirements because most herbs
are not GRAS for use as a dietary supplement, are not approved food additives, and are not the subject of prior sanctions
or are the subject of prior sanctions that have been waived. Furthermore, the comments complained that FDA's process
for acting on GRAS affirmation petitions is notoriously slow and extremely costly. The comments maintained that
the proposed safety requirements would discourage manufacturers from submitting health claim petitions for dietary
supplements, would delay the approval of such petitions, and could well amount to a total ban on health claims for certain
dietary supplements. The comments suggested that FDA require safety determinations only for those substances with
no history of safe use and provide that the absence of known safety problems will be sufficient proof of safety for substances
with a long history of use. 
Other comments urged FDA to be flexible in its determination of safety for substances in dietary supplements. A number
of these comments stressed the importance of FDA recognizing that safety can be determined solely through the historical
use of such substances. Some of the comments noted that many components of supplements, particularly herbs, have
been used for hundreds or thousands of years without safety problems. The comments also noted that herbs are used safely
throughout three-fourths of the world as a principal means of medicine. The comments declared that regulatory authorities
in Great Britain, Germany, Japan, and many other nations have researched various herbal supplements and found them
to be safe when consumed at the levels of use likely to be contemplated under a health claim petition. One comment also
noted that information concerning accurate dosage, indications, contraindications, and quality control measures
are also available in past editions of the U.S. Pharmacopeias and National Formularies. These comments urged FDA
to accept all relevant data on the safe use of herbal dietary supplements, including foreign studies and monographs
that evidence the safety of these products. One comment declared that FDA is legally bound to consider evidence involving
herb usage outside the United States when reviewing the safety of herbs. 
One comment asserted that FDA should evaluate the safety of vitamins and minerals in terms of their effect on the normal
population and not on those consumers with unusual conditions or sensitivities. The comment acknowledged that such
consumers need clear label ingredient statements as well as education on foods to deal with their problems. The comment
asserted, however, that these consumers should be held responsible for some degree of self-protection. The comment
maintained that this approach is consistent with the agency's policy on persons with allergies to food components.
A few comments asserted that the safety of a dietary supplement should be defined in terms of whether or not harm may
occur under the conditions of use defined by the supplement's labeling, rather than in terms of an arbitrary cutoff
such as the RDI. The comment maintained that a systematic review of all components of dietary supplements is not necessary
and suggested that the agency undertake safety reviews on a case-by-case basis where it believes a potential safety
concern might exist.
Several comments asserted that FDA is not equitable in its concern for the safety of dietary supplements as compared
to the safety of other products regulated by the agency. Some comments asserted that the safety record of dietary supplements
is far better than many FDA-approved food additives such as aspartame, against which, according to the comments,
the agency receives and ignores thousands of consumer complaints annually. Other comments asserted that FDA's intense
interest in the safety of products would be better focused on prescription drugs, which are responsible for over 1/2
million deaths annually as compared to the no or few deaths attributable to the consumption of dietary supplements.

However, several comments supported FDA's proposal to require that petitioners for a health claim for a substance
in a dietary supplement demonstrate that the substance is safe and lawful. The comments agreed with the agency that
such a requirement is implicit in the act, and that the labeling law in no way diminishes FDA's responsibility to ensure
the safety of foods. 
FDA concludes that the preliminary requirement that the safety of a substance be demonstrated should apply to substances
in dietary supplements in the same manner that it applies to substances in foods in conventional food form. The amendment
to the act enacted by the 1990 amendments cannot be implemented independently of the remaining portions of the act
(see section 9 of the 1990 amendments). The act must be considered as a whole, and FDA's responsibility for ensuring
the safety of foods is explicitly provided for in other sections of the act (see sections 201(s), 402(a)(1) and (2),
and 409 of the act).
As the agency explained in the dietary supplement health claims proposal, the fact that the act contains such explicit
safety authority is particularly significant because the agency will be specifically authorizing the health claims
that will be made. In view of this affirmative action, FDA authorization of a health claim places the agency's imprimatur
on the claim. Moreover, the claim will encourage consumption of the substance. It would be a violation of the agency's
responsibility under the act to authorize a health claim about a substance, whether it be in a dietary supplement or
in food in conventional food form, without being satisfied that the use of the substance is safe. Certainly, FDA would
have almost no assurance that it would be protecting the public health if it permitted, as some comments suggest, all
substances except those that are actually known to cause safety problems to be the subject of health claims. It would
be a great and tragic irony if substances that were the subject of health claims because of one effect caused injury
because of another. This is the situation that Congress sought to avert by including section 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) in
the act. FDA's preliminary requirement is fully consistent with the principles that underlie that section.
The fact that some herbs and other ingredients of dietary supplements have been used for thousands of years does not
necessarily justify a conclusion by FDA that their use under all conditions is safe, but it may. First, FDA needs a basis
for concluding that such use was in fact without harmful effect. Second, FDA needs a basis for concluding that consumption
of ingredients in a supplement carrying a health claim would be in amounts comparable to those consumed safely in the
past. The proponents of claims for such substances are certainly free to demonstrate that the use of those substances
is generally recognized as safe based on their common use in food prior to 1958. The agency notes, however, that the
use of many of these substances has been primarily as a drug, tonic, or folk remedy, rather than as food (see 53 FR 16544
at 16545; May 10, 1988). This fact is confirmed by some of the comments summarized above. As drugs, the levels and frequency
of use of these substances may have been significantly different than the levels and frequency of use that will result
from their use as foods. Although the agency will consider evidence involving herb usage outside the United States,
FDA still needs to review data on the identity of the substance, the safety of the substance, the use of the substance
in food, the context of its use, and the frequency of use in the country where use of the substance occurred (see 50 FR
27294 at 27295, July 2, 1985). Evidence that another country has studied the safety of an herbal supplement and found
it to be safe would certainly be relevant and should be submitted to FDA. It is important, however, that as much of the
evidence that provided the basis for the country's determination as is possible be submitted to FDA.
Although formal recognition of safety by FDA admittedly can be lengthy and expensive, such formal recognition is
not required under this preliminary requirement. In responding to concerns raised by comments suggesting that FDA
recognize manufacturers' private GRAS determinations, the agency stated in the health claims final rule the following
concerning  101.14(b)(3)(ii) (58 FR 2478 at 2502 through 2503):


FDA acknowledges that the GRAS affirmation and food additive listing process can be lengthy. Thus, FDA designed  101.14(b)(3)(ii)
to provide flexibility with respect to the type of showing of safety that is necessary to make a substance eligible
to be the subject of a health claim. GRAS affirmation and food additive listing are but two of the procedures by which
a substance may meet this preliminary requirement.


FDA intends to consider the basis of manufacturers' independent GRAS determinations where such determinations
are submitted with petitions for health claims and may use its discretion to accept, without formal affirmation,
the independent determination of GRAS where FDA believes that such action would be appropriate. As FDA pointed out
in the previous comment, however, the agency would not be fulfilling its responsibilities under the act if it were
to permit a substance to be the subject of a health claim without satisfying itself that the use of that substance is
safe.


Although FDA will consider all manufacturers' independent GRAS determinations where the basis for such determinations
are submitted with petitions for health claims, the agency advises that it will generally not be possible for FDA to
judge whether GRAS determinations based on complex scientific evidence are valid within the short timeframes mandated
under the 1990 amendments for health claims petitions. Instead, agency agreement with an independent determination
that a substance is GRAS will be most likely where the substance is an ingredient, or a component of a food ingredient,
that was in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, in a similar context. However, where such agreement occurs,
the agreement does not constitute GRAS affirmation. Instead, the history of common use in food, coupled with the fact
that FDA knows of no reason to question the safety of the food ingredient, means that the substance will be treated as
if it is an unlisted GRAS substance (as provided for in   170.30(d) and 182.1(a) (21 CFR 170.30(d) and 182.1(a)))
in the manner provided for in the food ingredient list in 21 CFR Part 182.



(58 FR 2478 at 2503.)



Under this final rule, this statement is fully applicable to substances in dietary supplements. The agency believes
that this policy on independent determinations that a substance is GRAS demonstrates that FDA will be flexible in
assessing conformance with the safety preliminary requirement. 
FDA disagrees with assertions that the agency should evaluate the safety of dietary supplements in terms of only the
normal population. It would be unconscionable for the agency to adopt a policy of ignoring adverse effects, some of
which could be life-threatening, of any foods, including dietary supplements, on vulnerable segments of the population.
Furthermore, there is no basis under the act for such a policy. FDA does attempt, however, to find the most practicable
solutions to assuring consumers of a safe food supply. For example, the agency generally does not base safety decisions
on atypical population subgroups that will use the product. Where there are subgroups of consumers (e.g., consumers
with certain sensitivities) that could suffer adverse effects from consuming the product, FDA may place certain
restrictions on the use of the product or rely on labeling solutions (such as those the agency has used for sulfiting
agents and yellow 5) as a condition for its safe use, rather than denying the availability of the product to the entire
population. 
Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, FDA is making health claims for substances in dietary supplements, like claims
for any other food, subject to  101.14(b)(3)(ii).


C. Scientific Standard


19. Many comments expressed concern that FDA would apply the term ``significant scientific agreement'' in an unreasonable
manner by demanding too much supporting evidence on substance/disease relationships before approving health claims.

Several comments insisted that FDA is misinterpreting the requirements for the scientific standard for food in conventional
food form as well as for dietary supplements. The comments asserted that the law does not require that there be significant
scientific agreement that a nutrient/disease relationship has been conclusively established, but only that the
statements made in a claim be supported by the available evidence. As an example, one of the comments asserted that
the requirements of the law would be fully met by a properly qualified label claim such as, ``Although no scientific
consensus has been established, several clinical studies suggest that daily consumption of Vitamin C as part of a
well-balanced diet may reduce the frequency of colds.'' A number of comments asserted that the standards for authorizing
health claims on foods are more stringent than those authorizing the use of drug claims. Several comments argued that
FDA is being unduly restrictive by requiring that manufacturers perform expensive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
tests to prove the validity of a claim under the proposed regulations. These comments stated that such requirements
would deter manufacturers from seeking new uses for herbs and other substances used in dietary supplements. The comments
maintained that a more lenient standard would encourage manufacturers to engage in research to develop more healthful
products. The comments further asserted that the disparate treatment of foods and drugs is especially unfair when
the enormous difference in safety factors between dietary supplements and untested prescription drugs is considered.

Some of the comments asserted that FDA had not been fair to date in its evaluations of health claims under this standard.
One of these comments asserted that FDA had approved only four of the ten congressionally-proposed health claims,
not seven, as FDA claimed in the preamble to the proposed regulations. 
Some comments maintained that FDA should not require a unanimous or near-unanimous consensus among experts in order
to find that there is ``significant scientific agreement'' concerning a claim. A few of the comments pointed out that
the legislative history of the 1990 amendments clearly indicates that such a level of agreement is not to be required.
Other comments urged that FDA consider the requirement for ``significant scientific agreement'' to be satisfied
as long as there is agreement among a majority of scientists familiar with the research in a given area. These comments
noted that Commissioner Kessler offered testimony supporting this interpretation before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. Other comments maintained that the requirement for ``significant scientific
agreement'' only requires agreement among a significant number of qualified experts. One of these comments requested
that FDA include a provision in the regulations that the standard of ``significant scientific agreement'' is not
one of unanimity to prevent confusion among manufacturers and consumers. A few comments asked that FDA's regulations
include a provision that guarantees that ``significant scientific agreement'' will be considered to have been achieved
when a credible health authority, particularly an agency of the U.S. Government, recommends the consumption of a
nutrient because of its relationship to a disease or health-related condition.
One comment suggested that FDA not use the phrase ``significant scientific agreement'' to evaluate proposed health
claims, despite its inclusion in the language of the 1990 amendments, because the meaning of the phrase is ambiguous.
The comment suggested that FDA should simply consider the totality of publicly available scientific evidence to
determine whether or not a particular health claim can be justified. 
FDA disagrees with assertions that it is conducting validity assessments for health claims in an unduly restrictive
manner. FDA does not require that manufacturers perform controlled clinical trials to prove the validity of a claim.
To the contrary, as discussed in the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2506), the scientific standard for health
claims is less stringent than the requirements for approval of a new drug. In the case of a new drug, section 505(d)(5)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)(5)) states that the Secretary shall refuse to approve an application for approval of such
a drug where there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect that it purports or is represented
to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof. Section
505(d) provides further that the term ``substantial evidence'' means evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled
investigations, including clinical investigations (human studies conducted in a controlled clinical setting),
by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved. (The
statutory term ``substantial evidence'' should not be confused with the same term used by some comments to refer to
``more than a scintilla and less than a preponderance'' of evidence.) Based on this statutory direction, the agency
has identified a number of characteristics that are present in ``adequate and well-controlled'' studies in  314.126
(21 CFR 314.126).
Section 101.14(c) of FDA regulations does not mandate requirements as stringent as those for drugs in section 505(d)(5)
of the act. Section 101.14(c) contains no mention of ``substantial evidence,'' ``adequate and well-controlled
investigations,'' or of ``clinical investigations.'' To the contrary,  101.14(c) contains more flexibility
than the drug provisions of the act because it provides FDA with authority to authorize claims based on ``scientific
evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally
recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant agreement among experts qualified
by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence'' (section
403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the act).
Consistent with this flexibility, FDA did not prescribe a specific set, type, or number of studies as being sufficient
to support a health claim in the health claims final rule that applied to food in conventional food form. In that rule,
the agency advised (58 FR 2478 at 2506) that it would consider all relevant data on a topic, including clinical studies,
epidemiological data, and animal studies. 
In addition, the 1990 amendments directed FDA to consider 10 nutrient-disease relationships. In the January 6, 1993,
final rules, FDA authorized claims with respect to seven of those 10 relationships (see 58 FR 2537, 2552, 2622, 2665,
2739, 2787, and 2820). In addition, FDA has recently proposed to authorize claims concerning an eighth, folic acid
and neural tube defects (see 58 FR 53254, October 14, 1993). FDA believes that these approvals demonstrate that it
is not conducting validity assessments for health claims in an unduly restrictive manner.
FDA agrees that the legislative history of the 1990 amendments makes clear that Congress did not intend, in calling
for significant scientific agreement about the support for a claim, to require that such agreement represents a full
consensus among scientists. The House Report (Ref. 1) states: 


* * * the standard does not require that there be a unanimous agreement among experts. Instead there must be a significant
agreement among experts, but it does not require that every expert in the field approve or agree with the claim. 


The agency shares the comments' concern that a requirement of consensus would mean that some valid health claims would
not be authorized and, by restricting such claims, would counter Congress' intent that health claims supported by
a significant scientific agreement be made available to consumers. The agency never intended to require that claims
be supported by a consensus among scientists and has not done so. 
The agency is sensitive to the comments' perception that the scientific standard, particularly the phrase ``significant
scientific agreement,'' is subjective. The agency believes, however, that any standard involving the evaluation
of scientific evidence and opinions derived from that evidence must be somewhat subjective. FDA, in proposing not
to define ``significant agreement'' among experts in the November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537 at 60548) proposal, noted
that each situation may differ with the nature of the claimed substance/disease relationship. The agency believes
that in deciding whether significant scientific agreement about the validity of a claim exists, it is necessary to
consider both the extent of agreement and the nature of the disagreement on a case-by-case basis. 
The House Report (Ref. 1) makes clear that Congress intended the ``significant scientific agreement'' standard
to be a flexible one by pointing out that, in reviewing scientific studies, FDA may give greater weight to the studies
that it finds more persuasive. The House Report also clarifies that the overriding consideration in assessing whether
to authorize a claim should be the Secretary's level of comfort about the validity of the claim. The agency believes
that this clarification provides clear guidance for the application of the standard, and thus it is not incorporating
the changes requested by the comments in the codified language of the regulations.
FDA does not believe it has in any way been unfair in its approval of health claims to date. Earlier in this preamble in
response to comment 2, FDA explained why certain specific health claims were not approved. Nevertheless, the agency's
statement in the dietary supplement health claims proposal that it had authorized claims on 7 of the 10 nutrient-disease
relationships is correct. In the case of 3 of the relationships, however, the claims were authorized for foods rather
than specific nutrients. In these cases, as explained previously, although there was sufficient evidence to attribute
certain disease risk reductions to the consumption of certain foods, and those foods are marked by significant levels
of the nutrients in question, there was insufficient evidence to attribute any disease risk reduction directly to
consumption of the nutrients themselves. 
FDA does not agree that it should define ``significant scientific agreement'' as agreement among a majority of scientists
familiar with the issues. Commissioner Kessler's statements about significant scientific agreement being 50 or
60 percent agreement were intended to show the contrast between this term and the term ``consensus,'' not to provide
a specific definition of ``significant scientific agreement.'' There is simply no bright line that FDA can draw in
this area. Ultimately, the agency must exercise its scientific judgment, arrived at after input from the scientific
community. 
The agency does not agree that significant scientific agreement should be considered to have been achieved when a
credible health authority, particularly an agency of the U.S. Government, recommends the consumption of a nutrient
because of its relationship to a disease or health-related condition. While FDA recognizes the significance of such
recommendations, Congress charged FDA with the responsibility of authorizing health claims on the food label and
labeling. Nonetheless, the agency is mindful of the admonition in section 403(r)(4)(C) of the act that reads: ``If
a petition for a regulation under subparagraph (3)(B) relies on a report from an authoritative scientific body of
the United States, the Secretary shall consider such report and shall justify any decision rejecting the conclusions
of such report.'' 
Accordingly, FDA is retaining the requirement for ``significant scientific agreement'' in this regulation. 
20. Many comments applauded the agency's determination not to underrate any scientific evidence on the basis of its
cultural or geographic origin. One of these comments noted that the United States is one of the most ethnically diverse
nations in the world and stated that a study done anywhere in the world is likely to be relevant to at least one U.S. subpopulation.
A few of these comments noted that some of the studies done on herbal dietary supplements have been conducted under
foreign drug protocols and requested assurance that FDA would consider such data to be part of the publicly available
scientific evidence supporting prospective health claims. Another of these comments asserted that the ``totality
of publicly available scientific evidence'' should include not only ``well designed studies'' but also ethnobotanical
and other traditional usage information which is often available for herbs and other dietary supplements.
The agency reaffirms its commitment to consider any evidence submitted in support of the scientific merits of a claim
and in the context of the totality of available evidence. FDA will not underrate any study on the basis of its cultural
or geographic origin. Evidence in support of a proposed health claim, however, will attain value in direct proportion
to the significance in the U.S. population of the effects of the substance in question on the disease or health-related
condition addressed by the claim (see  101.14(b)(1)). Also, the agency advises that it will consider ethnobotanical
and other traditional usage information. However, the agency points out that under  101.14(c), the evidence
must provide the basis for significant scientific agreement that the claim is valid. 


D. General Labeling Requirements


In the health claims final rule, FDA established a number of general requirements for health claims for food in conventional
food form in  101.14(d) to ensure that consumers are provided with valid and reliable information about the
value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of a particular substance, as part of a total dietary pattern, may have
in affecting certain diseases or health-related conditions. 
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, the agency proposed that dietary supplements be subject to the
same general requirements that it has established for food in conventional food form in  101.14(d). The agency
advised that specific references to dietary supplements in  101.14(d) are not necessary because FDA's revision
of  101.14(a)(2), the definition of the term ``substance,'' to include components of dietary supplements
will link dietary supplements to the health claim for which  101.14(d) prescribes general requirements.


1. FDA Authorization of Valid Claims


Section 101.14(d)(1) provides that when FDA determines that a health claim is valid, the agency will propose a regulation
in Subpart E of Part 101 to authorize the use of the claim. Further, the provision states that if the claim pertains to
a substance not provided for in  101.9, FDA will propose to amend that regulation to include declaration of the
substance. To ensure that the provisions established in  101.14(d)(1) apply equally to all forms of dietary
supplements, the agency proposed in the dietary supplement proposal to revise  101.14(d)(1) to reference,
in addition to  101.9, the provisions of  101.36 (21 CFR 101.36), which establish requirements for the
nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. 
FDA received no comments requesting changes in this aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting this
section as proposed.


2. General Requirements


Section 101.14(d)(2) requires that health claims on foods in conventional food form: (1) Be consistent with the specific
authorizing regulation for the claim; (2) be limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion)
of the substance, as part of a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition;
(3) be complete, truthful, and not misleading; (4) contain all required information for that claim in one place without
other intervening material (except that the principal display panel (PDP) of the label or labeling may bear a reference
statement such as ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis,'' with the entire claim
appearing elsewhere on the other labeling); and (5) enable the public to comprehend the information provided and
to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet. If the claim is about
the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food must be sufficiently
low to justify the claim. For example, if a definition for use of the term ``low'' has been established for that substance,
the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative
level has been established for the substance in the authorizing regulation. If the claim is about the effects of consuming
the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food must be sufficiently high
and in an appropriate form to justify the claim. For example, if a definition for use of the term ``high'' for that substance
has been established, the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless
a specific alternative level has been established for the substance in the authorizing regulation. (See  101.14(d)(2)(vii)(A)
for additional requirements where the food meets the ``high'' or ``low'' requirements based on its reference amount
customarily consumed and the labeled serving size differs from that amount. See  101.14(d)(2)(vii)(B) for
guidance about how a food can meet the ``high'' and ``low'' requirements where the food is sold in a restaurant.)
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, FDA proposed that dietary supplements be subject to these requirements
to ensure that consumers are provided with scientifically valid, nonmisleading, and reliable information about
the value that ingestion of the particular substance in the dietary supplement may have in affecting a disease or health-related
condition.
21. One comment stated that FDA should mandate that dietary supplements bear health claims for which they are eligible
in order to promote public awareness of the benefits associated with those supplements.
FDA does not believe that it is appropriate to adopt a general policy requiring the inclusion of health claims on the
labels of all foods eligible to bear them. The agency notes that while the 1990 amendments provide for the appearance
of health claims on the labels of foods qualified to bear them, they do not make the appearance of those claims mandatory.

FDA believes that many manufacturers will choose to include health claims on the labels of qualified foods because
of the marketing benefit offered by their appearance. Because health claims provide information regarding the benefits
associated with the increased or decreased dietary intake of various substances in the product rather than information
regarding the particular product itself, consumers will be made aware of the benefits of consuming other foods that
do or do not contain the particular substance, even if a particular food product does not itself bear the health claim.

22. One comment asserted that FDA should require manufacturers who elect to craft their own health claims, rather
than to use the model claim verbatim, to secure agency approval for their claims with respect to understandability.

FDA disagrees with this comment. Section 3(b)(1)(A)(vii) of the 1990 amendments prohibits FDA from requiring persons
to secure agency approval before placing a health claim on a product, provided that the claim is in compliance with
the applicable regulation authorizing the health claim. The House Report (Ref. 1) states that this section ``makes
it clear that the regulations will not require premarket review of each claim; they will only require that the claim
be consistent with the terms and requirements of the regulations.'' The agency believes that it is possible to paraphrase
a model health claim while remaining consistent with the terms and requirements of the regulations permitting that
claim. This position is similar to agency 
policy that permits the use of terminology other than that established in a final OTC drug monograph in labeling of
an OTC drug product to describe indications for use (51 FR 16258, May 1, 1986). Consistent with that policy for OTC drug
labeling, the agency believes that the goal of ensuring scientifically valid, truthful, and nonmisleading labeling
without inhibiting effective consumer communication does not require exclusive use of language in a model health
claim. The model language along with other requirements for a claim will, nevertheless, provide the standard for
measuring the accuracy of alternative language developed by food manufacturers for their products because FDA has
included all mandatory labeling elements of a health claim in the model claim. Of course, manufacturers should recognize
that a health claim that fails to convey all the mandatory elements of the claim will subject a product to regulatory
action.


3. Nutrition Labeling


Section 101.14(d)(3) requires that health claims on foods in conventional food form must bear nutrition labeling
in accordance with   101.9 and 101.10 (21 CFR 101.9 and 101.10). In the dietary supplement health claims proposal,
the agency proposed to revise  101.14(d) to reference  101.36 (21 CFR 101.36), in addition to   101.9
and 101.10. In response to section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act (formerly section 403(q)(5)(E)),  101.36 establishes
requirements for the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. 
FDA received no comments requesting changes in this aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting this
section as proposed.


E. Prohibited Health Claims


In  101.14(e) of the health claims final rule, FDA established, for foods in conventional food form, a number
of situations where health claims are prohibited. In that paragraph, FDA provides that a health claim may not be made
on the label or in the labeling of a food unless: (1) The claim is specifically provided for in authorizing regulations
in Subpart E of 21 CFR part 101; (2) the claim conforms to all general provisions of 
 101.14, as well as to all specific provisions in the authorizing regulation; (3) none of the disqualifying
levels identified in  101.14(a)(5) is exceeded in the food, unless specific alternative levels have been established
for the substance in the authorizing regulation, and the labeling bears a statement that complies with  101.13(h)
highlighting the nutrient that exceeds the disqualifying level; (4) no substance is present at an inappropriate
level as determined in the specific provision authorizing the claim in Subpart E of 21 CFR part 101; (5) the label does
not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age except if the claim is specifically
provided for in Subpart E of 21 CFR part 101; and (6) except for dietary supplements, the food contains 10 percent or
more of the RDI or Daily Reference Value (DRV) for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber before any
nutrient addition. 
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, the agency proposed that dietary supplements be subject to the
general prohibitions that have been established for foods in conventional food form in  101.14(e). The agency
tentatively concluded that this action was appropriate because these prohibitions: (1) Reflect the statutory restriction
in section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act that requires that health claims be made in accordance with the provisions of section
403(r)(5)(D) for dietary supplements; (2) ensure that inappropriate, unsubstantiated, and fraudulent health
claims are not made; and (3) reduce the potential for consumer confusion when confronted with a situation in which
there would be health claims for substances when they are present in dietary supplements but not when they are present
in foods in conventional food form. The agency advised that specific references to dietary supplements in  101.14(e)
generally are not necessary because FDA's proposed revision in  101.14(a)(2) of the definition of the term
``substance'' to include components of dietary supplements will bring dietary supplements within the coverage
of  101.14(e).
FDA did propose, however, to include a reference to dietary supplements in the introductory sentence of paragraph
(e) to clarify that dietary supplements may be food. Specifically, FDA proposed to insert the phrase ``regardless
of whether the food is in conventional food form or dietary supplement form'' into that sentence to make clear that
no expressed or implied health claims may be made on the label or in labeling of any food unless the conditions in that
paragraph are met.


1. Claims Not Authorized By FDA


Section 101.14(e)(1) and (e)(2) prohibit the use on a food label or in food labeling of any claim that expressly or by
implication characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition unless: (1)
The claim is specifically provided for in Part 101, Subpart E_Specific Requirements for Health Claims; and (2) the
claim conforms to all general provisions of  101.14, as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate
section in subpart E of 21 CFR part 101. 
23. A number of comments asserted that the marketplace is currently saturated with hundreds of false and misleading
claims, ranging from rather innocuous statements to blatant claims concerning the treatment of cancer, AIDS, heart
disease, asthma, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and other diseases and health-related conditions.
One of these comments urged FDA to regulate as implied health claims those brand names that imply that a product is useful
in preventing particular diseases. The comment asserted that an implied health claim can be made by the inclusion
of the name of a disease in a brand name, as well as by label statements that slant the meaning of a brand name toward disease
prevention. 
FDA realizes there are a number of misleading claims in use on products. The agency reviews these claims as part of its
regular enforcement activities and takes action against such claims based on such factors as the public health significance
of the claim, how clearly it violates the act, and the availability of agency resources.
24. A number of comments stated that manufacturers should be allowed to include information on the traditional use
of various supplements on their labels. These comments noted that many other countries allow supplement labels to
indicate traditional uses of the product, provided that the level of evidence supporting such use is accurately represented.
Many comments asserted that statements concerning the safe usage of dietary supplements should not be considered
a health claim. The comments maintained that the exclusion of such information from food labeling would endanger
the public health. 
Dietary supplements that bear labeling that expressly or by implication characterizes the relationship of any substance
to a disease or health-related condition will be subject to the provisions of section 403(r) of the act. However, if
the claim reveals that the product is intended to be used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
of a disease, as would likely be the situation where the product is presented as an alternative to conventional drug
therapy, the product, like any other product that does so, is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act and subject
to the requirements for drugs in Chapter V of the act. 
However, supplement manufacturers, like all other food manufacturers, are welcome to submit health claim petitions
that establish the validity of claims that characterize the relationship of a substance to a disease or a health-related
condition in a manner that is appropriate for a food. (See section III.G. of this document.) Any such petition that
shows that the preliminary requirements in  101.14(b) and the scientific standard for a health claim in  101.14(c)
are met will provide the basis for a proposal to authorize a claim in accordance with section 403(r)(4)(A)(i) of the
act.
In addition, FDA advises manufacturers of dietary supplements that where a claim does not include one or both of the
basic elements of a health claim, it generally constitutes dietary guidance that may be provided on the label or in
labeling, so long as it is presented in a truthful and nonmisleading manner. 
25. One comment urged that FDA permit the appearance of preliminary health claims on the labeling of a product other
than its label. The comment maintained that the 1990 amendments draw a clear distinction between a product label and
its labeling and noted that labeling has much more room in which a manufacturer may sufficiently explain the current
state of scientific evidence regarding a preliminary claim. 
FDA disagrees with this comment. Section 403(r)(1) of the act clearly prohibits the appearance of health claims that
are not made in accordance with FDA regulations and that appear ``

in the label or labeling 

 of the food (emphasis added).'' The agency's objections to preliminary claims are fully discussed in this preamble
in its response to comment 4.


2. Additional Limits on Health Claims


In the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2534), FDA adopted new  101.14(e)(6) to require consistency with
dietary guidelines by prohibiting health claims unless the food contains 10 percent or more of the RDI or DRV for vitamin
A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition.
(A complete discussion of why these specific criteria were selected appears in the preamble of that document (see
58 FR 2478 at 2521 through 2522).) This provision stresses the importance of selecting foods so that dietary sources
of calories are coupled with sources of nutrients. This approach incorporates established levels of significance
for nutrients in food and is based on the amounts in foods of certain nutrients required to be listed on the label as part
of mandatory nutrition labeling. As such, this approach applies to food in conventional food form. 
FDA specifically exempted dietary supplements from this requirement. Such supplements are intended only to provide
nutritive value to the daily diet, and they make no pretense of serving as substitutes for conventional food. (Nutrient
supplements in conventional food form are, however, intended to serve as substitutes for conventional food.) As
a result, it would not be logical to hold such products to criteria designed to ensure consistency with dietary guidelines
for conventional food. A dietary supplement that meets the qualifying criterion in  101.14(d)(2)(vii) and
that does not contain a nutrient at a disqualifying level specified in  101.14(a)(5) possesses nutritive value
for a health claim irrespective of whether or not it may also provide calories. Accordingly, in the dietary supplement
health claims proposal, FDA did not propose to make any change in the exemption for dietary supplements from the provisions
of  101.14(e)(6). For consistency with the proposed definition of the term ``dietary supplement,'' however,
FDA proposed to revise the wording for this exemption to delete the phrase ``not in conventional food form'' because
the definition of ``dietary supplement'' states that such foods are not in conventional food form. 
FDA received no comments requesting changes in this aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting this
section as proposed.


F. Applicability


In the health claims final rule, FDA established a provision in  101.14(g) stating that the requirements for
health claims in  101.14 apply to foods intended for human consumption that are offered for sale. In the dietary
supplement proposal, FDA proposed that dietary supplements also be covered by  101.14(g). FDA stated that
it had tentatively concluded that a reference to dietary supplements was appropriate in paragraph (g) to clarify
that dietary supplements can be food. Specifically, FDA proposed to revise paragraph (g) as follows:




Applicability

. The requirements of this section apply to foods intended for human consumption that are offered for sale, regardless
of whether the foods are in conventional food form or dietary supplement form.


26. One comment asserted that FDA should allow health claims authorized for use on dietary supplements to also appear
on OTC drug products that provide ``high'' levels of a particular nutrient, e.g., calcium-osteoporosis claims on
calcium carbonate antacid tablets. 
FDA received a comment similar to this one on the health claims proposal. This comment provides no basis for the agency
to provide a different response to this comment than it did in the health claims final rule.
As explained in the preamble of the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2500), multiple use products that are both
foods and drugs present a difficult set of competing concerns for the agency. Such products are likely to be both an
OTC drug and a dietary supplement.
Most OTC drug products are developed to address some type of acute medical problem that is expected to be of short duration.
If the problem persists, it is important that the person with the problem know that it may be more severe than he or she
otherwise thought, and that he or she should seek medical attention. Labeling on such products, therefore, includes
instructions to use the product for a limited period of time and, if the problem persists, to seek medical intervention.
Thus, the time limits on use of the product are important to the health of the users.
Dietary supplements, on the other hand, are developed for inclusion in a daily diet at levels that are consistent with
dietary use and may often be consumed throughout most of a person's lifetime. Labeling on dietary supplements contains
no instructions for seeking medical intervention or for limiting the duration of consumption of the supplement.
Rather, under the new regulations, dietary supplements will be able to bear nutrient content and health claims, which
focus the consumer's attention on the advantages that consuming the product will have in helping the consumer to maintain
a healthy diet. Moreover, where the supplement bears a health claim, the claim will contain information about how
long-term ingestion of the supplement may promote health.
Where dietary levels and therapeutic levels differ (as is generally the case and is in fact the case with antacids and
calcium supplements), an apparent conflict is created when both food and drug labeling appear on the same product.
In the case of the drug labeling, consumers are given directions for use that involve high consumption during a limited
time period. In the case of the food labeling, consumers are given directions for lower consumption with no time constraints.
Even though label instructions may identify those directions for food and drug use in separate locations, FDA is concerned
that consumers will incorrectly assume that the therapeutic dosage is appropriate for dietary use, and that the directions
for food use will undercut the warning in the drug labeling to seek medical care if the condition persists. Where the
labeling is not properly followed, significant adverse consequences may result.
The agency knows of no broad approach that it can use to harmonize a nutrient content claim or a health claim with drug
labeling. A drug that is labeled with instructions for use that both limit and do not limit consumption would be misbranded
under section 502(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(a)) if it failed to contain a material fact_that is, how to reconcile
these conflicting instructions. 
However, FDA does not believe that it would be appropriate to preclude such claims under all circumstances. Such claims
may be permissible if a firm can demonstrate that dual claims can be made in a manner that will neither misbrand the product
nor create a safety problem. The agency suggests that anyone desiring to make a health claim or a nutrient content claim
that complies with section 403(r) of the act on a product that is both a food and a drug contact the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, OTC Compliance Branch (HFD-312), FDA, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, to discuss whether
it would be possible to put such a claim on the product and still comply with the drug provisions of the act. 


G. Petitions


27. A number of comments urged FDA to streamline its procedures for approving health claims in order that dietary supplement
manufacturers may include the most current, reliable information on their products. The comments stated that the
inclusion of such information is critically important to dietary supplements because, unlike foods in conventional
food form, they are consumed only for the health benefits associated with them. The comments specifically proposed
that FDA add the following paragraphs to  101.70(j):


(4) 

 Final Rule

. FDA will, within 120 days of the date of publication of the proposed rule, issue a final rule authorizing or prohibiting
the requested use of the health claim.
(5) 

 Expedited Action on certain petitions

. If FDA determines during its initial review of the petition that it accurately represents the recommendations of
any agency or department of the U.S. Government with public health responsibilities, or of any other public health
organization that is recognized as a credible source of information on diet and health, FDA will publish a proposed
rule authorizing the requested use of the claim no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of the petition and will
issue a final rule no later than 60 days from the date of publication of the proposed rule.


The comments maintained that new provision in paragraph (j)(4) would correct an obvious oversight in the existing
regulations, i.e., the establishment of a firm deadline for a proposed rule but no firm deadline for a final rule. The
comments also contended that paragraph (j)(5) is necessary to address FDA's failure to act promptly to approve claims
that are based on the recommendations of public health authorities, such as its failure to approve a health claim for
folic acid in accord with the recommendations of PHS agencies. 
FDA advises that its failure to specify in  101.70(j) a deadline for the publication of a final rule regarding
the use of a proposed health claim was not an oversight. Section 403(r)(4)(A)(i) does not require that the agency adhere
to any deadline for the publication of a final rule. While FDA could establish such a timeframe by regulation, it does
not believe that the adoption of such a requirement would be prudent. The comment period following the publication
of proposed rules is a critical step in determining whether a proposed regulation is appropriate for adoption. In
the instance of health claim regulations, significant information concerning the validity of the substance-disease
relationship underlying the proposed health claim may be submitted by interested parties during the comment period.
Also, the comment period may bring to light a previously unforeseen potential for the use of a health claim, if adopted
without modification, to be misleading to consumers or to create serious potential threats to the public health.
The agency has no way to guarantee that it will be able to adequately resolve such problems within the suggested timeframe.
In such instances, if faced with a specific timeframe, FDA would be forced to either deny an otherwise valid health
claim petition, or to approve it without erecting the regulatory framework that it believes necessary to ensure that
the public health is safeguarded. Therefore, FDA is not adopting the suggested time limit on the issuance of a final
rule. However, the agency advises that it committed to issuing final rules on health claim petitions as quickly as
possible consistent with the issues presented and the agency's available resources.
With respect to suggestions for shorter timeframes for certain petitions, FDA advises that the agency's ability
to meet timeframes is influenced by many factors, such as work priorities and availability of personnel. FDA considers
the statutory timeframes for assessing the validity of health claims and for issuing a proposed regulation to be extremely
short, given the need to evaluate the totality of available scientific evidence on a substance and a disease or a health-related
condition. Given the agency's limited resources, it would not be practicable to shorten these timeframes further.
However, FDA points out that although action on petitions for most claims will require virtually all of the time provided
by the statutory timeframes, nothing would prohibit the agency from acting in less time than the timeframes provide
if it is possible to do so. Thus, it is likely that a petition for a claim on a well-accepted substance/disease relationship
would be reviewed more expeditiously than one for which scientific agreement is not as clear.
28. A few comments urged FDA to consider the limited label space available on many dietary supplements in developing
model health claims. The comments stated that concise model claims will provide guidance to manufacturers on how
to convey health claims in succinct statements that comply with all of FDA's requirements and will thus help ensure
that the health claims presented to consumers are clear and comprehensible.
FDA realizes that there is a limit to the amount of information that can be presented on a food label. However, the agency
believes that it must ensure that consumers understand that factors other than dietary intake of the nutrient may
bear on the substance-disease relationship. Given the imperative of ensuring consumer understanding of a message
that must be presented in a very limited space, the agency is faced with the difficult task of determining what information
is necessary in a claim, and what information is not. FDA believes that its regulations in subpart E of 21 CFR part 101
represent an acceptable balance between the consumer's right to understand the full context of the claim and the manufacturer's
concern over claim length. By delineating the information that is mandatory and optional in a claim, FDA is relieving
manufacturers from having to include information that is of tangential importance but ensuring that those who wish
to make a claim do so in a manner that provides a useful and understandable message to consumers. FDA advises that it
will take a similar approach when providing model health claims in the future. FDA also notes that manufacturers who
are not satisfied with the model claim are free to develop their own versions of the claim, provided that those versions
include all of the information required by the authorizing regulation.
29. Several comments raised the issue of product-specific health claims by asserting that many manufacturers will
be dissuaded from undertaking the scientific studies and other investments necessary to obtain approval of new health
claims petitions by the fact that approved health claims will be allowed for use on all qualifying products. However,
a number of comments stressed that in a health claim, the role of the total diet should be emphasized rather than the
role of a specific food in risk reduction.
FDA advises that section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act pertains to a claim about the relationship between a nutrient and
a disease or health-related condition, rather than about particular food product and such a condition. While the
agency has used the term ``substance'' in lieu of the word ``nutrient'' and has said that a ``substance'' can be a food,
in doing so the agency was only trying to cover circumstances such as those presented by fruits, vegetables, and grain
products in which it was not possible to identify the specific nutrient in a broad class of foods that was having the
observed effect on the risk of disease. FDA was not thereby including formulated products as possible subjects of
health claims. Such products are formulated to include particular substances because of the nutritional effects
of those substances. Thus, a health claim for such a product would appropriately be about the substance in the formulated
product and not about the product itself. 
In addition, section 403(r)(3)(B)(iii) of the act directs the agency to require that health claims enable the public
to understand the information in the context of the total daily diet. As explained above, FDA finds that to effect Congress'
intent in passing the 1990 amendments, the same requirement should apply to health claims made on dietary supplements.
FDA believes that a claim that refers specifically to the effects on a disease or health-related condition resulting
from the consumption of a certain brand name of product would unduly emphasize the importance of that product and not
the importance of the total daily diet. Also, such claims could imply that other brands of the same food, as well as other
foods containing the substance that is the subject of the claim, might not have the same effect on the disease or health-related
condition and thus would be misleading under section 403(a) of the act. Accordingly, the agency finds that it is not
appropriate to approve product-specific health claims.
30. One comment suggested that FDA provide regular monthly or quarterly reports concerning newly approved health
claim petitions for display in the supplement section of stores. The comment maintained that such a list distributed
by FDA would increase consumer confidence in the claims when they appear on supplement labels.
Although FDA recognizes that there could be benefits to consumers from such reports, the agency simply does not have
the resources to provide the reports on an ongoing basis. However, FDA expects that trade associations and other interested
parties will provide information to firms that will ultimately be passed on to consumers. 


IV. Constitutional Issues


A. First Amendment


1. General


31. Several comments raised concerns that the regulations violate the First Amendment. Comments cautioned that
the regulations would be unconstitutional if they limited the dissemination of scientific opinion or prevented
scientifically valid, well-balanced information from reaching the public. 
In the final rule on health claims for foods in conventional food form, 58 FR 2478 at 2524 through 2528 (January 6, 1993),
the agency addressed in detail the First Amendment implications of its regulation of health claims on the food label
and in food labeling. The agency concluded that its regulations, and the act as amended by the 1990 amendments, do not
violate the First Amendment. FDA considers its earlier analysis to be relevant to the present rulemaking and incorporates
it into this document. The agency notes that none of the comments submitted on the proposed rule on health claims for
dietary supplements disputed the agency's earlier discussion, and no comments argued that subsequent court decisions
have called the agency's conclusions into question. 
FDA disagrees with the comments that asserted that these regulations unconstitutionally suppress scientific opinion.
The regulations address what may appear in labeling; they do not affect any other means of disseminating information.
Indeed, far from limiting the dispersal of scientific information, as stated above, these regulations, which implement
the 1990 amendments to the act, permit more information to appear on the label than the act allowed before its amendment.

The agency does not agree with the comments' implication that the Constitution requires a more lenient standard of
scientific validity than that codified in  101.14(c). FDA has a strong interest in ensuring that the information
that appears on the food label is scientifically valid and believes that the standard it has adopted best furthers
that interest. When FDA seeks to ensure that food is not misbranded, it may place restrictions on label contents. See

right to employ every conceivable method of communication at all times and in all places'' (

Members of City Council

 v.

 Taxpayers for Vincent

, 466 U.S. 789, 812 (1984)). Indeed, ``Freedom of Speech does not include the freedom to violate the labeling provisions
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.'' (

United States

 v.

 Articles of Food * * * Clover Club Potato Chips

, 67 F.R.D. 419, 424 (D. Idaho 1975)).


2. Pure Speech


31a. One comment asserted that health claims are not commercial in nature and are entitled to full First Amendment
protection. This comment described health claims as typically being mere recitations of scientific findings made
by independent medical authorities and backed by substantial agreement in the medical community. The comment asserted
that the proposed regulations reach ``pure scientific speech'' placed on labels and in product advertisements and
violate the First Amendment by: (1) denying speakers channels of communication to present truthful, nonmisleading
health claims; (2) denying speakers the right to communicate a particular kind of content; (3) discriminating against
certain speakers and forms of communication; and (4) denying the constitutional rights of willing listeners, viewers,
and readers. 
FDA disagrees with the comment. The agency notes initially that the comment misinterprets the scope of the agency's
action. These regulations apply only to health claims made on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements and not
to advertising.
The agency disagrees that health claims are entitled to full First Amendment protection. The agency has stated that,
although it does not consider it necessary for its First Amendment analysis to determine whether or not food labeling
fits the definition of commercial speech, labeling should certainly be considered closer to commercial speech than
to ``pure'' speech (58 FR 2478 at 2525 through 2526). It has also stated that ``[l]abeling statements on food products
intended for sale would clearly appear in the context of a commercial transaction and would `propose' such a transaction.''

United States

 v.

 General Nutrition, Inc

., 638 F. Supp. 556, 562 (W.D.N.Y. 1986). Commercial speech receives a lesser degree of protection than noncommercial
speech. (See, e.g., 

City of Cincinnati

 v.

 Discovery Network, Inc.

, 113 S. Ct. 1505, 1513 (1993)). The comment does not make a persuasive argument for considering health claims on dietary
supplement labels to be pure speech, and FDA is not aware of any circumstance in which a court has considered such information
on the food label to be ``pure'' speech. Contrary to the comment's assertion, information that is placed on the label
by a commercial enterprise in order to encourage the consumer to make a purchase should not be considered protected
speech simply because it was generated by an independent source. (See, e.g.,

 United States

 v.

 Article of Drug * * * B-Complex Cholinos Capsules

, 362 F.2d 923, 927 (3d Cir. 1966) (free speech was not implicated when third party's statements were taken as evidence
of manufacturer's intent); 

United States

 v.

 Articles of Drug

, 32 F.R.D. 32, 34-35 (S.D. Ill. 1963) (First Amendment did not prohibit seizure of third party's book used as
labeling)).
Although the agency disagrees that health claims should be considered noncommercial speech, and although many of
the cases cited in the comment deal with fully protected speech rather than commercial speech and thus do not provide
a useful analytical framework for these regulations, the agency will address the comment's arguments individually.

The agency disagrees that its action denies speakers channels of communication. As discussed above, the agency has
placed no limits on the dissemination of scientific information but has acted to permit certain information to appear
on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements. Adequate alternative channels remain for the dissemination of
scientific information. For example, regulation of the information that may appear on the food label in no way affects
the ability of a scientist to publish experimental results in a journal. Moreover, any interested person may petition
for a health claim regulation.
The agency disagrees that these regulations should be subjected to the close scrutiny afforded restraints on the
content of pure speech. Of the cases cited by the comment to advance this argument, one is particularly instructive.
In 

Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

 v.

 FCC

, the court declined to apply strict scrutiny to the ``must-carry'' provisions of the 1992 Cable Act, applying instead
the ``interest-balancing traditionally applied to content-neutral speech regulation or legislation ostensibly
unrelated to expression that is discovered to impose incidental burdens on speech.'' 819 F. Supp. 32, 39 (D.D.C. 1993),

 prob. juris. noted

, 114 S. Ct. 38 (1993). In passing the Cable Act, ``Congress employed its regulatory powers over the economy to impose
order upon a market in dysfunction, but a market in a commercial commodity nevertheless; not a market in speech'' (

Id

. at 40). Similarly, with the 1990 amendments Congress sought to bring order to the food market. (See, e.g., 136 Congressional
Record S16611 (October 24, 1990) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (``It is up to us to make order out of chaos in the regulation
of food * * *.''); 136 Congressional Record H12953 (October 26, 1990) (statement of Rep. Waxman) (``[T]he bill will
once and for all settle the confusion surrounding health claims.'')). As discussed in the final rule on health claims
for foods in conventional food form, the case law establishes that FDA's power to regulate the food label derives from
its broad regulatory powers over food (58 FR 2525). As in 

Turner

, these regulations are valid under the limited scrutiny that has been afforded restrictions on speech under extensive
regulatory schemes involving areas of economic activity (

Id

).
The comment argued that the regulations are impermissibly discriminatory because they require government regulators
to exercise judgment based on subjective line-drawing, guided not by rational principles of law and science but by
the will of the censorship authority. FDA disagrees. The agency has carefully articulated the appropriate scientific
standard that it will apply to proposed health claims. Unlike the ordinance at issue in 

Forsyth County

 v. 

Nationalist Movement

, cited by the comment, the decision whether to authorize a health claim is not left to the agency's whim but is based
on objective factors. 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2403 (1992). In 

Forsyth

, the county administrator's exercise of discretion to vary the fee for assembling or parading was not reviewable
and did not require an explanation (Id). FDA's procedure for evaluating a proposed health claim, including use of
notice and comment rulemaking, presents a far different situation, and one that does not offend the Constitution.
Contrary to the comment's assertion, the fact that FDA does not presume to prohibit the publication of health claims
in the popular media does not show an ``arbitrary predilection to enforce [the] law against particular speakers and
forum owners rather than others.'' FDA has no interest in regulating the dissemination of scientific information
in the popular media and has no authority to do so. Rather, its strong interest is in ensuring that health claims made
in labeling, on which consumers are likely to rely when making purchasing decisions, are truthful, not misleading,
and scientifically valid. The agency's action contrasts with the categorical ban on commercial newsracks struck
down in

 City of Cincinnati

 v. 

Discovery Network, Inc.

, 113 S. Ct. 1505. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the restriction, which was intended to advance Cincinnati's
interest in safety and esthetics, overemphasized the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech
by prohibiting only newsracks holding commercial handbills and not those holding ordinary newspapers (

Id

. at 1514). The city thus discriminated against a use of newsracks that was no more harmful to safety and esthetics than
the use it permitted (Id. at 1511). On the other hand, FDA's regulation of health claims in labeling bears a specific
relationship to the interests the agency has asserted, because it is directed specifically at ensuring the reliability
and validity of these claims (see 

id

. at 1514.) Contrary to the comment's assertion, the limited scope of FDA's regulations_i.e., food labeling_does
not amount to discrimination. 
Finally, the agency disagrees that its regulations deny the constitutional rights of willing listeners, viewers,
and readers. First, this argument overstates the impact of these regulations, which will affect only the labeling
of dietary supplements and not other sources of information about these products. Second, these regulations will
actually advance consumers' First Amendment interest in obtaining information on which to base a purchasing decision,
``by insuring that the information is not false or deceptive'' (

National Commission on Egg Nutrition

 v.

 FTC

, 570 F.2d 157, 162 (7th Cir. 1977), 

cert. denied

, 439 U.S. 821 (1978)). ``The fact that health is involved enhances the interests of both consumers and the public in
being assured `that the stream of commercial information flow clearly as well as freely''' (Id. (citing 

Virginia State Board of Pharmacy

 v. 

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council

, 425 U.S. 748, 772 (1976)); see also 

American Home Products

 v.

 FTC

, 695 F.2d 681, 714 (3d Cir. 1982)).


3. Commercial Speech


31b. Two comments asserted that, if health claims on labels are considered commercial speech, FDA's regulations
violate the First Amendment because they are more restrictive than necessary to achieve the government's goals.
One comment recognized that FDA has ``a great interest in preventing false and misleading claims and in preventing
fraud in the marketplace,'' but argued that closing the door on truthful, qualified claims that are based on significant
scientific evidence is not reasonably responsive to those interests. The other comment asserted that the wholesale
suppression of truthful, nonmisleading speech carries with it the silencing of speech indispensable to the health
of the American people, and that the agency's action not only lacks a rational relationship to the end chosen, public
health, but actually undercuts that goal by shrouding the public in ignorance.
FDA disagrees that these regulations, if considered under the commercial speech doctrine, are unconstitutional.
The final rule on health claims for foods in conventional food form, 58 FR 2478 at 2526-2527 (January 6, 1993),
contains an analysis of that regulation in light of the four-part test set out in 

Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.

 v.

 Public Service Commission

, 447 U.S. 557, 563-564 (1980). That discussion is equally applicable to the present rulemaking. 

 Central Hudson

 states that commercial speech that is inherently misleading is not protected and may be prohibited (

Id

.). Speech that is only potentially misleading may be restricted, so long as the restrictions directly advance a substantial
governmental interest and are no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest (

Id

. at 566). 
The comments do not dispute the government's substantial interest in promoting public health by ensuring that consumers
have access to information about dietary supplements that is scientifically valid, truthful, reliable, informative,
and not misleading. (Indeed, one comment stated that the government's interest is ``great.'') Rather, the comments
focus on the last two parts of the 

Central Hudson

 test: whether the regulations directly advance the governmental interest, and whether there is a reasonable fit
between regulatory ends and means. 
FDA disagrees that its regulations will undercut its stated goals. Rather, the regulations directly advance the
governmental interest. The regulations provide for FDA review of the relevant scientific evidence on a proposed
health claim before the agency decides whether to authorize use of the claim. In this way, the regulations ensure that
health claims are scientifically valid and reliable, and that they will not mislead consumers. At the same time, the
regulatory scheme encourages the provision of information to consumers that will enable them to maintain healthful
dietary practices. Thus, these regulations advance the government's interest in a ``direct and material way'' (Edenfield
v. Fane, 113 S. Ct. 1792, 1798 (1993)). 
FDA also disagrees that these regulations are more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest. Recently,
the Supreme Court stated that the ``commercial speech cases require a fit between the restriction and the government
interest that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable'' (

United States

 v.

 Edge Broadcasting Co.

, 113 S. Ct. 2696, 2705 (1993) (citing 

Board of Trustees

 v.

 Fox

, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989); 

Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates

 v.

 Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico

, 478 U.S. 328, 344 (1986))). In

 Edge

, the Court upheld a federal statute prohibiting the broadcast of lottery advertising by a broadcaster licensed to
a State that does not allow lotteries. Although the law prevented a broadcaster in North Carolina, with a majority
of its listeners in Virginia, from airing nonmisleading advertisements for Virginia's lottery, the Court had ``no
doubt that the fit * * * was a reasonable one.'' 

Edge

, 113 S. Ct. at 2705. The Court stated that the validity of a restriction should be judged ``by the relation it bears to
the general problem of accommodating the policies of both lottery and nonlottery States, not by the extent to which
it furthers the Government's interest in an individual case.'' 

Id

. (citing 

Ward

 v.

 Rock Against Racism

, 491 U.S. 781 (1989)). Moreover, once the government has established a strong interest in adopting and enforcing
rules of conduct designed to protect the public, it is entitled to protect its interest by applying a prophylactic
rule to those circumstances generally, Id. at 2706 (citing 

Ohralik

 v.

 Ohio State Bar Association

, 436 U.S. 447, 464 (1978)). 
After considering alternate approaches, the agency has concluded that the procedures and scientific standard set
out in these regulations best advance its stated interests under the act. (See discussion

 supra

.) As in

 Edge

, the government has weighed competing interests: the interest in making information available on the dietary supplement
label and in its labeling about the relationship between nutritional substances and disease or health-related conditions,
and the interest in ensuring that the information provided is scientifically valid, informative, and not misleading.
As in 

Ohralik

 and

 Edge

, the agency is entitled to protect its interest by applying a prophylactic rule to general circumstances, in this
case by permitting only health claims about substance-disease relationships that the agency has determined are
scientifically valid to appear in labeling. See 

Edge

, 113 S. Ct. at 2706. 
The means that FDA has chosen to further its substantial interest are reasonable, ``in proportion to the interest
served,'' and ``narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.'' 

 City of Cincinnati

 v.

 Discovery Network, Inc

., 113 S. Ct. at 1510 n.12 (quoting 

Fox

, 492 U.S. at 480). The regulations specifically target labeling claims about relationships between substances
and disease or health-related conditions. They are not intended to restrict the flow of information to the public,
but rather to ensure that the scientific validity of information provided to consumers in the labeling of a product
has been established. Indeed, the regulations leave open a broad range of other possible methods of communication.


4. Chilling Effect


31c. One comment asserted that an overbroad suppression of scientific speech on communications media used by manufacturers
creates a pervasive chilling effect on their willingness (and that of the scientists they employ) to communicate
their findings for public and professional consideration. 
The overbreadth doctrine is an exception to traditional rules of standing and is applicable in First Amendment cases
in order to ensure that an overbroad statute does not chill the exercise of protected rights. 

Leonardson

 v.

 City of E. Lansing

, 896 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir. 1990)). The doctrine may apply to a regulation that, in all its applications, directly
restricts protected First Amendment activity and is not narrowly tailored 

 Secretary of State of Maryland

 v.

 Joseph H. Munson Co.

, 467 U.S. 947, 965 n.13 (1984). FDA disagrees that these regulations are overbroad or that they will chill free speech.
The activity prohibited under the act and these regulations_marketing dietary supplements bearing unapproved
health claims in their labeling_constitutes a ``core of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable
conduct,'' (467 U.S. at 965-966). Labeling is defined in the act and easily identifiable. See 21 U.S.C. 321(m)
(``The term labeling means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its
containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.''). Moreover, courts have held that misbranding food
is not protected under the First Amendment. See, e.g., 

Kellogg Co.

 v.

 Mattox

, 763 F. Supp. 1369, 1381 (N.D. Tex. 1991), 

aff'd

 sub nom. 

Kellogg Co.

 v. 

Morales

, 940 F.2d 1530 (5th Cir. 1991); 

United States

 v.

 General Nutrition, Inc.

, 638 F. Supp. 556, 562 (W.D.N.Y. 1986); 

United States

 v.

 Articles of Food * * * Clover Club Potato Chips

, 67 F.R.D. 419, 424 (D. Idaho 1975). Finally, as discussed above, the regulations are narrowly tailored to accomplish
the government's goals. 
In any event, it is doubtful that the overbreadth doctrine would apply to these regulations, particularly if they
are considered to regulate commercial speech, because the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.
``[C]ommercial speech is generally considered less susceptible to the chilling effect of regulation than other,
more traditionally recognized forms of speech, such as political discourse.'' 

 Kraft, Inc.

 v.

 FTC

, 970 F.2d 311, 321 (7th Cir. 1992), 

cert. denied

, 113 S. Ct. 1254 (1993). 


B. Fifth Amendment


32. One comment asserted that the takings clause of the United States Constitution provides protection to dietary
supplement trade names. It argued that  101.14 might proscribe certain trade names that FDA has allowed to remain
on the market for years. The comment urged FDA to give more attention, under Executive Order 12630, to the regulation's
possible takings implications.
When it issued its final regulations governing conventional foods under the 1990 amendments, FDA fully discussed
the takings implications of those regulations. (See 58 FR at 2397 through 2400 and 2528 through 2529). This discussion,
including the underlying takings analysis, is incorporated herein. The agency concluded that there would be no regulatory
taking under the Fifth Amendment if a manufacturer is required to alter its brand name when the brand name asserts by
implication a relationship between the presence or level of a substance in the food and a disease or health-related
condition, and that relationship is not the subject of an approved health claim (58 FR at 2529). Because the agency
conducted its analysis before passage of the DS act, it fully took into account the regulations' impact on dietary
supplements. Although the comment stated that FDA must address the issues raised by its regulations in light of Executive
Order 12630, it did not provide any additional information that the agency has not already considered. Therefore,
the agency concludes that it is not necessary to address potential takings issues in any greater detail.


V. Other Issues


33. A few comments objected to the period of time provided for public comment on the proposal, stating that it was too
short. One of these comments asserted that FDA had no reason to establish such a short deadline other than to curtail
public input on the proposed regulations. Another of these comments requested that FDA extend the period for public
comment on the proposed regulations to give consumer advocacy groups, health care professionals, and the scientific
community adequate time to prepare the information and opinions needed to fairly resolve the issues associated with
the proposal.
As explained in the preamble of the proposals, the DS act requires that final rules implementing the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements be issued by December 31, 1993. To meet this statutory timeframe, FDA was forced
to limit the comment period for the proposed regulations to 60 days. Thus, the agency reaffirms that it is unable to
grant any extensions to the comment period. 
34. One comment requested that FDA clarify that the compliance date is the date on which manufacturers of dietary supplements
must begin to label products in accordance with  101.14.
FDA advises that the comment is correct. Section 10(a)(2) of the 1990 amendments specifically states that ``* * * section
403(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act * * * shall not apply to food 

which was labeled 

before the effective date of the amendments * * * [emphasis added].'' Accordingly, the effective date of the health
claims regulations for dietary supplements adopted by the agency under section 403(r) refers to the date on which
a dietary supplement is labeled.
35. A number of comments concerned the requirement in  101.14(d)(2)(iv) that states that all claims must appear
in one place, in the same type size, without intervening material. The comments addressed the exception in this provision
that a short reference statement may appear on the label, ``See ______ for information about the relationship between
______ and ______,'' with the blanks filled in with references to the location of the labeling on which the full claim
appears, the name of the substance, and the disease or health-related condition. The comment requested that FDA allow
graphic material constituting an implied health claim to appear on the PDP without the accompanying referral statement
or full health claim, as long as the graphic material appeared in conjunction with the full health claim elsewhere
on the labeling. The comment justified this request based on the lack of sufficient label space on the PDP for the referral
statement.
FDA does not believe that it should make the requested revision in  101.14(d)(2)(iv). In situations where graphic
material constitutes an implied health claim, and the reference statement is not present, the graphic material on
the labeling is in fact a shortened form of the health claim. FDA explained in response to comment 69 in the health claims
final rule that shortened health claims are misleading because they do not include facts that are material in light
of the representation that is made and that are necessary to understand the claim in the context of the daily diet. 


IV. Impact Statements


A. Economic Impact


In its dietary supplement labeling proposals pertaining to health claims, nutrition labeling, and nutrient content
claims in the June 18, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 33700, 33715, and 33731), FDA stated that the proposed rules on the labeling of dietary supplements, taken as
a whole, would have associated costs of approximately $20 million. Thus, the agency concluded that the proposed rules
do not constitute a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96-354), FDA explored whether the proposed rules may have a significant impact on small businesses
and tentatively concluded that they do not.
FDA has evaluated many comments that it received in response to its economic impact analysis. Because the issues raised
in the comments relate to all three proposals, FDA has combined its discussion of these comments and presented them
in the final rule regarding the establishment of the date of application published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of
available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and safety effects; distributive
impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the agency analyze the options for regulatory
relief for small businesses. FDA has concluded, based on its review of the available data and comments, that these
final rules are not significant as that term is defined by Executive Order 12866. Further, in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that these final rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small businesses.


B. Environmental Impact


The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of this rule when it was part of the proposed rule pertaining
to both foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements (November 27, 1991 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 60537 at 60562)). At that time, FDA determined under  25.24(a)(8) and (11) that the proposed action was
of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment. No new information
or comments have been received with respect to health claims for dietary supplements that would affect the agency's
previous determination that there is no significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact
statement is not required. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


In the dietary supplement proposal of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33700 at 33714), FDA announced that the agency had submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review the collection of information requirements contained
in proposed  101.70, for petitions regarding the use of health claims in conjunction with food labeling on dietary
supplements. Also in that document, FDA published its estimated annual collection of information burden for this
provision.
None of the more than 1,200 comments received in response to the dietary supplement proposal addressed the content
of petitions under the proposed health claim petition requirements. Thus, the agency's estimate of the annual reporting
and recordkeeping burden from the health claim petition requirements contained in this final rule remains unchanged
from the estimate that it announced in June 1993.
FDA has submitted copies of the final rule to OMB for its review of these reporting requirements.

Food Labeling: Health Claims and Label Statements; Folate and Neural Tube Defects


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that, in accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments), as amended by the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act), the regulation proposed
on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), to authorize the use of a health claim about the relationship between folate and the
risk of neural tube defects (NTD's) is now considered a final regulation for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
herbs, and other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements). The proposed regulation set out the information
that must be included in such a health claim to ensure that it is an accurate representation of the effect of intake of
folic acid on the risk of NTD's, and that any claims that are made are understandable, informative, and not misleading.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


FDA is announcing that, in accordance with section 3(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(A)(x), and (b)(2) of the 1990 amendments
as amended by the DS act (Pub. L. 102-571), the regulation proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), to authorize
the use of a health claim about the relationship between folate and the risk of NTD's is now considered a final regulation
for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements).


II. Passage of 1990 Amendments


The 1990 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (Pub. L. 101-535) gave the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), and by delegation FDA, the authority to issue regulations authorizing
health claims on the labels and in the labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B))
provides that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease
or health-related condition, unless the claim is made in accordance with procedures and standards established under
section 403(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)). 
The 1990 amendments also directed the Secretary to determine through rulemaking whether claims regarding 10 nutrient-disease
relationships met the requirements of the act. The relationship of folic acid and NTD's was among those 10 topics (section
3(b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments). 


III. Chronology of Regulatory and Other Activities Related To Folate and Ntd's


A. The 1991 Proposed Rule


In the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537), FDA proposed to not authorize a health claim on folic acid and NTD's. The agency tentatively
concluded that the available evidence did not establish that the standard that FDA had proposed for health claims
for dietary supplements under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act was met, that is, that there was not significant scientific
agreement, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, that the claim is valid. 


B. The Public Health Service Recommendations


In September 1992, the Public Health Service (PHS) issued a recommendation that all women of childbearing age in the
United States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0.4 milligram (mg) of folic acid/day for the purpose
of reducing their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other NTD's. The recommendation was based
on data suggesting that folic acid, when given at a high dose (4 mg), can reduce the risk of recurrence of NTD's and on
a synthesis of information from studies that used multivitamins containing folic acid at dose levels from 0 to 1,000
micrograms/day. The PHS recommendation identified approaches and identified outstanding issues, including the
appropriate intake of folate, the potential role of other nutrients in reduction of risk of NTD's, safety concerns,
and the ``folate-preventable'' fraction of NTD's. 


C. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992


In October 1992, the DS act was enacted. This statute imposed a moratorium on FDA's implementation of the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993. The DS act directed FDA to issue proposed rules to implement
the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements by June 15, 1993, and to issue final rules based on these proposals
by December 31, 1993. The DS act also amended the so-called ``hammer'' provision of the 1990 amendments, section 3(b)(2)
of the 1990 amendments, to provide that if the agency did not meet the established December 31, 1993, timeframe for
issuance of final rules, the proposed regulations would be considered final regulations. 


D. The 1993 Final Rules for Health Claims for Foods in Conventional Food Form


On January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2606), FDA published a final rule to not authorize a health claim for folic acid and NTD's. However,
the agency reaffirmed its support of the PHS recommendation that all women of childbearing age in the United States
who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0.4 mg of folic acid daily to reduce their risk of having a pregnancy
affected with spina bifida or other NTD's. The agency noted, however, that unresolved questions about the safe use
of folate remained. The agency concluded that it could not authorize a health claim until these questions were resolved.
Because of the DS act, FDA took no final action with respect to the use of a health claim on folic acid and NTD's on dietary
supplements.


E. The 1993 Proposal to Authorize a Health Claim on Folic Acid and NTD's


On October 14, 1993, FDA published a proposed rule to authorize the use of a health claim about the relationship of folate
and NTD's on the labels of foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements (58 FR 53254). FDA provided 60 days
for comment on this proposed action. The comment period closed on December 13, 1993. 
Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, as amended by section 202(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the DS act, provides that if the
Secretary does not promulgate final regulations on any of the health claims applicable to dietary supplements in
a timely manner, the proposed regulations shall be considered final regulations but not until December 31, 1993.
FDA did not issue a final regulation on the use of a health claim on folic acid and NTD's on dietary supplements by December
31, 1993. Therefore, FDA is issuing this document announcing that by operation of the law, the proposal to authorize
a health claim about the relationship of folate and NTD's published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 14, 1993, is now considered a final regulation applicable to the labels and labeling of dietary supplements
only. The agency proposed that 21 CFR part 101 be amended as follows:


PART 101_FOOD LABELING


2. Section 101.71 

Health claims: claims not authorized

 is amended by removing paragraph (c) and by redesignating paragraphs (d) through (f) as (c) through (e), respectively.



3. New  101.79 is added to subpart E to read as follows:


 101.79 

Health claims: folate and neural tube defects. 


(a) 

Relationship between folate and neural tube defects

_(1) 

Definition

. Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or serious
disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects and account
for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the brain or spinal
cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy, the defect
may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant.
(2) 

Relationship

. The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest evidence
for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom that
showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing 4 milligrams
(mg) (4,000 micrograms ( u g)) folic acid daily had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products
that contain this level of folic acid are drugs.) In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial
that used a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800  u g (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review
of the observational studies that reported use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000  u g of folic acid, the Food
and Drug Administration concluded that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate,
at levels attainable in usual diets, may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. 
(b) 

Significance of folate

_(1) 

Public health concern

. Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., about 2,500 cases
among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest
risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with
a such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family
history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural
tube defects but not of other birth defects.
(2) 

Populations at risk

. Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors, including genetics,
geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal health,
including maternal age and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with
a neural tube defect, those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being
treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these
characteristics. Rates for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west
coast than on the east coast.
(3) 

Those who may benefit

. Based on a synthesis of the results of several observational studies, the Public Health Service has estimated that
about 50 percent of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies in the United States (e.g., about 1,250) may be averted
annually if all women consume adequate amounts of folate daily (i.e., 0.4 mg) throughout their childbearing years.
(c) 

Requirements

. The label or labeling of food in conventional food form or dietary supplements may contain a folate/neural tube defect
health claim provided that:
(1) 

General requirements

. The health claim for a food or supplement meets all of the general requirements of  101.14 for health claims,
except that a food or dietary supplement may qualify to bear the health claim if it meets the definition of the term ``good
source.'' 
(2) 

Specific requirements

_(i) 

Nature of the claim

_(A) 

Relationship

. A health claim that women who are capable of becoming pregnant and who consume adequate amounts of folate daily during
their childbearing years may reduce their risk of having a pregnancy affected by spina bifida or other neural tube
defects may be made on the label or labeling of foods in conventional food form or of dietary supplements provided that:
(B) 

Specifying the nutrient

. In specifying the nutrient, the claim shall use the terms ``folate,'' ``folic acid,'' ``folacin,'' ``folate, a
B vitamin,'' ``folic acid, a B vitamin,'' or ``folacin, a B vitamin.'' 
(C) 

Specifying the condition

. In specifying the health-related condition, the claim shall identify the birth defects as ``neural tube defects,''
``birth defects, spina bifida, or anencephaly,'' ``birth defects of the brain or spinal cord anencephaly or spina
bifida,'' or ``spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord;''
(D) 

Multifactorial nature

. The claim shall state that neural tube defects have many causes and shall not imply that folate intake is the only recognized
risk factor for neural tube defects. 
(E) 

Prevalence

. In specifying the prevalence of neural tube defects among women in the general population, the claim shall state
that such birth defects ``which, while not widespread, are extremely significant'' or ``* * * birth defects * * * that,
while not widespread, are extremely significant.'' 
(F) 

Reduction in risk

. The claim shall not attribute any specific degree of reduction in risk of neural tube defects, including mention
of the Public Health Service estimate that 50 percent of neural tube defects may be averted annually, to maintaining
an adequate folate intake throughout the childbearing years. The claim shall state that some women may reduce their
risk of a neural tube defect pregnancy by maintaining adequate intakes of folic acid during their childbearing years.

(G) 

Safe upper limit of daily intake

. Claims on fortified foods in conventional form and on dietary supplements that contain more than 25 percent of the
RDI for folate (100  u g per serving or per unit) shall state that 1 mg folate per day is the safe upper limit of intake
(e.g., ``Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000  u g per day from all sources.'') 
(H) 

The claim

. The claim shall not state that a specified amount of folate (e.g., 400  u g in a dietary supplement) is more effective
in reducing the risk of neural tube defects than a lower amount (e.g., 100  u g in a breakfast cereal or from diets rich
in fruits and vegetables). 
(ii) 

Nature of the food

_(A) 

Requirements

. The food or supplement shall meet or exceed the requirements for a good source of folate as defined in  101.54;
(B) 

Diets adequate in folate

. The claim shall identify diets adequate in folate by using phrases such as ``* * * diets that include 2 to 4 servings
per day of fruits) including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables
and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such as breads, rice, and pasta) and fortified cereals.
Such diets provide many essential minerals and vitamins, including folate. Women who do not eat well-balanced diets
or who may be concerned about their diets may choose to obtain folate from dietary supplements.''; or ``Adequate amounts
of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables,
including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta,
fortified cereals, or a dietary supplement.''; or ``Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from
diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or from
dietary supplements.''
(C) 

Dietary supplements

. Dietary supplements shall meet the United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) standards for disintegration and dissolution,
except that if there are no applicable U.S.P. standards, the folate in the dietary supplement shall be shown to be bioavailable
under the conditions of use stated on the product label. 
(iii) 

Limitation

. The claim shall not be made on foods in conventional food form or dietary supplements that contain more than 100 percent
of the RDI for vitamin A as retinol or preformed vitamin A or vitamin D. 
(iv) 

Nutrition labeling

. The nutrition label shall include information about the amount of folate in the food. This information shall be declared
after the declaration for iron if only the levels of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron are provided, or in accordance
with  101.9(c)(8) and (c)(9) if other optional vitamins or minerals are declared.
(3) 

Optional information

_(i) 

Risk factors

. The claim may specifically identify risk factors for neural tube defects;
(ii) 

Relationship between folate and neural tube defects

. The claim may include statements from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that summarize the relationship between
folate and neural tube defects and the significance of the relationship except for information specifically prohibited
from the claim. 
(iii) 

Personal history of a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy

. The claim may state that women with a history of a neural tube defect pregnancy should consult their physicians or
health care providers before becoming pregnant. 
(iv) 

Daily value

. The claim may identify the daily value level of 400  u g of folate per day as the target intake goal. 
(d) 

Model health claims

. The following are examples of model health claims that may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between
folate and neural tube defects:
(1) 

Example 1

. Women who consume adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube birth defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables
and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited
to 1,000  u g per day from all sources.
(2) 

Example 2

. Women who consume adequate amounts of folate daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of
having a child with a birth defect of the brain and spinal cord. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green
leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Women who have had a child
with a spinal cord birth defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be
limited to 1,000  u g per day from all sources.
(3) 

Example 3

. Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is adequate throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in citrus fruits
and juices, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products such as breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereal, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000  u g per day from all sources.
(4) 

Example 4

. Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is at least 400  u g daily throughout their childbearing
years may reduce their risk of having a child with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal
cord that, while not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate,
a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables, including
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or from a supplement. Women who have had a pregnancy affected with a neural tube defect should consult a physician
before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000  u g per day from all sources.



(5) 

Example 5

. Some women who consume the Daily Value of folate (400  u g) throughout their childbearing years may reduce their
risk of having a child affected with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while
not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Women of childbearing age should choose
well-balanced diets that include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings
of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such
as breads, rice, and pasta) or fortified cereals throughout their childbearing years. Such diets provide many essential
minerals and vitamins, including folate. Women who may be concerned about their diets may choose to obtain folate
from a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000  u g per day from all sources.






(e) 

Effective date

. For fortified foods, this regulation is effective on the date the food additive regulation on the use of folic acid
that was proposed on October 14, 1993, becomes effective.




The 1990 amendments state that FDA is to promptly publish notice of the new status of the proposed regulations in the


Federal Register

. This notice is issued in response to that requirement. The agency emphasizes, however, that this regulation is deemed
to be a final regulation only with respect to dietary supplements.



The agency notes that this document is part of a separate rulemaking contemplated by Congress if the final regulation
was not issued by December 31, 1993. This rulemaking bears a separate docket number from the one assigned to the October
14, 1993 rulemaking to distinguish it from that rulemaking, which is ongoing. The agency intends to continue its rulemaking
with respect to folic acid and neural tube defects and to issue a final rule as quickly as possible.



In this regard, FDA recognizes that clarification with respect to the legal status of claims about folic acid and NTD's
on foods in conventional food form is appropriate. FDA advises that, given the PHS recommendation and the results
of FDA's preliminary review of the evidence on this claim, at this time it has no intention of taking action against
foods in conventional food form that are naturally high in folate that bear a claim on this nutrient-disease relationship,
so long as the claim fully complies with the provisions of the regulation that has become final for dietary supplements
by operation of law.
However, for foods fortified with folic acid, the agency has more significant concerns. As explained in the health
claim proposal on folic acid and NTD's (58 FR 53254 at 53288) and the proposal to amend the food additive regulation
on folic acid that published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53312), there appears to be a rather narrow range of safe use of folic acid in food. Based on
this tentative view, FDA would be very concerned, at least until it reached a final determination in those proceedings,
if manufacturers began adding folic acid to their products, or increasing the amount of folic acid in their products,
to qualify for a claim. Therefore, FDA strongly discourages the use of a health claim about folic acid and NTD's on any
such fortified products pending the issuance of a final rule on this nutrient-disease relationship. 
As stated above, FDA intends to issue a final rule in the proceeding on a health claim on folic acid and NTD's that it began
on October 14, 1993, in the near future. FDA is in the process of evaluating the comments that it has received in that
proceeding, including the results of an advisory committee meeting held on October 14 and 15. FDA will attempt to resolve
the issues in that ongoing proceeding as soon as possible.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that, in accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments), as amended by the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act), the change in its regulations
that it proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296 through 53305), to reflect its tentative decision not to authorize
health claims relating an association between dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and cardiovascular disease
(CVD); antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease (CHD); and zinc and immune
deficiency in the elderly on the labels and in the labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and
other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements) is now considered a final regulation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


FDA is announcing that, in accordance with section 3(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(A)(vi), (b)(1)(A)(x), and (b)(2) of
the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101-535), as amended by the DS act (Pub. L. 102-571), the change in its regulations
that it proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296 through 53305), to reflect its tentative decision not to authorize
health claims relating an association between dietary fiber and cancer (Docket No. 93N-480F); dietary fiber
and CVD (Docket No. 93N-480C); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (Docket No. 93N-480A); omega-3 fatty
acids and CHD (Docket No. 93N-480O); and zinc and immune deficiency in the elderly (Docket No. 93N-480Z)
on the labels and in the labeling of dietary supplements is now considered a final regulation.


II. Passage of 1990 Amendments


The 1990 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary), and by delegation FDA, the authority to issue regulations authorizing health claims on the labels
and in the labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)) provides that a product is misbranded
if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related condition, unless
the claim is made in accordance with procedures and standards established under section 403(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)). 
The 1990 amendments also directed the Secretary to determine through rulemaking whether claims regarding 10 nutrient-disease
relationships meet the requirements of the act. Dietary fiber and cancer, dietary fiber and CVD, antioxidant vitamins
and cancer, zinc and immune function in the elderly, and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD were among the topics that FDA was
directed to evaluate under section 3(b)(1)(A)(vi) and (b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments. 

III. The 1991 Health Claims Proposals


In the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991, FDA proposed not to authorize health claims on dietary fiber and CVD (56 FR 60582); dietary fiber
and cancer (56 FR 60566); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (56 FR 60624); zinc and immune function in the elderly (56
FR 60652); and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD (56 FR 60663). The agency tentatively concluded that the available evidence
did not establish that the standard that FDA had proposed for health claims for dietary supplements under section
403(r)(5)(D) of the act was met, that is, the agency tentatively concluded that there was not significant scientific
agreement, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence that these claims are valid.


IV. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992


In October 1992, the DS act was enacted. This statute imposed a moratorium on FDA's implementation of the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993 (although the DS act did provide that FDA could authorize
claims for dietary supplements before that date). The DS act directed FDA to issue proposed rules to implement the
1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements by June 15, 1993, and to issue final rules based on these proposals
by December 31, 1993. The DS act also amended the so-called ``hammer'' provision of the 1990 amendments, section 3(b)(2)
of the 1990 amendments, to provide that if the agency did not meet the established December 31, 1993, timeframe for
issuance of final rules, the proposed regulations would be considered final regulations. 


V. The 1993 Final Rules For Health Claims For Foods in Conventional Food Form


On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules on the general requirements for health claims on the labels and in the
labeling of foods in conventional food form (58 FR 2478), and final rules authorizing health claims on seven nutrient-disease
relationships (calcium and osteoporosis; fat and cancer; saturated fat and cholesterol and CHD; fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer; fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber and
risk of CHD; and fruits and vegetables and cancer). Three of the health claims that FDA authorized were for fresh fruits
and vegetables and grains, and thus these claims were not authorized for dietary supplements. Because of the DS act,
FDA took no final action with respect to the use on dietary supplements of health claims on dietary fiber and cancer;
dietary fiber and CVD; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; zinc and immune function in the elderly; and antioxidant vitamins
and cancer. (The agency's actions with respect to health claims involving folic acid and neural tube defects are described
in a notice published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.)


VI. The 1993 Proposal to Not Authorize Health Claims For Dietary Supplements


On October 14, 1993, FDA published a proposal to not authorize health claims on the labels of dietary supplements on
five nutrient-disease relationships: Dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and
cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function in the elderly (58 FR 53296). FDA provided 60 days
for comment on this proposed action. Thus, the comment period closed on December 13, 1993. 
Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, as amended by section 202(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the DS act, provides that if the
Secretary does not promulgate final regulations on any of the health claims applicable to dietary supplements in
a timely manner, the proposed regulations shall be considered final regulations but not until after December 31,
1993. FDA did not issue final regulations on the use of health claims on dietary supplements on dietary fiber and cancer;
dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function
in the elderly by December 31, 1993. Therefore, FDA is issuing this document announcing that by operation of law, the
change in its regulations that FDA proposed to reflect a decision not to authorize health claims about the relationships
of dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD;
and zinc and immune function in the elderly, published in the October 14, 1993, 

Federal Register

, is now considered a final regulation by operation of law. The agency proposed that 21 CFR part 101 be amended as follows:



PART 101_FOOD LABELING


2. Section 101.71 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows:



 101.71 

Health claims: claims not authorized.


Health claims not authorized for foods in conventional food form or for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
herbs, or other similar substances:


* * * * *


The 1990 amendments state that FDA is to promptly publish notice of the new status of the proposed change in its regulations
in the 

Federal Register

. This notice is issued in response to that requirement.
The agency notes that this rulemaking constitutes a separate rulemaking from that instituted with respect to the
five nutrient-disease relationships on October 14, 1993. This separate rulemaking was contemplated by Congress
if a final rule was not issued by December 31, 1993. The agency notes, however, that the October 14, 1993, rulemaking
remains ongoing. 
In particular, with regard to antioxidant vitamins and cancer, on November 1 through 3, 1993, FDA held a public conference
on this nutrient-disease relationship. (The conference also covered antioxidant vitamins and CVD.) The transcript
of that meeting has been submitted to the Docket as a comment, and other comments were solicited in the announcement
of the conference (58 FR 54595, October 22, 1993). FDA intends to consider all comments and data received at this conference.
FDA intends to take any actions that it concludes are warranted by this information either in the ongoing rulemaking
on an antioxidant vitamins and cancer claim for dietary supplements or, if the agency concludes that it is appropriate,
in a separate rulemaking.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has determined that the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon should be reclassified from threatened
to endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). NMFS has determined that the current biological status
of the species is endangered based on the continued decline and increased variability of run sizes since its first
listing as a threatened species in 1989, the expectation of weak returns in certain years as the result of two small
year classes (1991 and 1993), and continuing threats to the population. Although measures implemented through consultations
conducted under section 7 of the ESA and State and Federal regulatory actions are designed to reduce adverse impacts
on the species, quantifiable improvements in population levels are not likely to be evident for several years. NMFS
will continue to closely monitor the status of this population, and evaluate the protective measures to determine
whether there is evidence that these measures have reduced or eliminated threats to the species and whether a change
in status may be warranted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Under the ESA and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 424), an ``endangered species'' is any species that is
in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A ``threatened species'' is any species
that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion
of its range. Based on a review of the status of the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon and the factors affecting
the species, NMFS has determined that it is endangered. 
The Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon is a unique population that is distinguishable from other chinook
salmon runs in the Sacramento River based on the timing of its upstream migration and spawning period. For the most
part, the winter-run chinook salmon population is comprised of three year classes, each of which primarily returns
to spawn as 3-year old fish. 
The best available data on winter-run chinook salmon abundance are the annual estimates of the spawning run size made
by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) based on counts of fish passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam. The
CDFG began estimating the annual run size for winter-run chinook salmon in 1967 after the Dam was placed in operation.
This time series of annual run size estimates has documented a precipitous decline in the winter-run chinook salmon
to its present low level (Table 1).

In 1989, the CDFG estimated that the winter-run chinook salmon run size was only 547 fish. This unexpectedly small
return represented nearly a 75 percent decline from the consistent, but low, run size of 2,000 to 3,000 fish that had
occurred since 1982. As a result of this unexpected decline, NMFS issued an emergency interim rule listing the winter-run
chinook salmon as threatened under the ESA on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32085). During the period the emergency interim
rule was in effect, NMFS published a proposed rule to list winter-run chinook salmon as threatened under the formal
listing procedures of the ESA on March 20, 1990 (55 FR 10260). To avoid a hiatus in protection of the species until the
formal listing process was completed, NMFS published a second emergency interim rule listing winter-run chinook
salmon as threatened on April 2, 1990 (55 FR 12191). On November 5, 1990, NMFS completed the formal listing process
and published a final rule (55 FR 46515) listing the species as threatened under the ESA. 
On June 5, 1991, the American Fisheries Society petitioned NMFS to reclassify winter-run chinook salmon as an endangered
species. At the time the petition was submitted, the best preliminary data available indicated that the 1991 run would
consist of a return of only 88 to 200 adults from the progeny of the 1988 run of 2,085 fish. The final run size estimate
made by the CDFG for 1991 was 191 fish (Table 1). NMFS reviewed the petition and determined that it contained substantial
information indicating that the petitioned action might be warranted. On November 7, 1991, NMFS announced (56 FR
58986) its intention to review the status of the species to determine whether reclassification was appropriate.
After conducting a status review, NMFS published a proposed rule (57 FR 27416) on June 19, 1992, to reclassify winter-run
chinook salmon as endangered. 
NMFS published a subsequent Federal Register

 notice (58 FR 31688) on June 4, 1993, delaying the issuance of a final determination on the reclassification for up
to six months pursuant to section 4(b)(6)(B) of the ESA. On September 10, 1993, NMFS published another 

Federal Register

 notice that provided information on the 1993 run size estimate (341 fish) and reopened the public comment period on
the proposed rule. 
This determination does not change any of the prohibitions against taking Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon.
Section 9 of the ESA prohibits taking endangered species. The regulations issued when this species was listed as threatened
in November 1990 also prohibit taking. 
In a separate rulemaking, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which is responsible for the List of Endangered
and Threatened Wildlife, will revise the list to reflect the reclassification of this species from threatened to
endangered. 


Current Status 


Conservation measures were implemented by the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) beginning in 1986-1987 in an
effort to improve adult passage conditions for winter-run chinook salmon at Red Bluff Diversion Dam and to provide
suitable spawning and egg incubation conditions for the species in the upper Sacramento River below Keswick Dam.
Despite the implementation of measures in 1986-1987 and 1987-1988, the winter-run chinook salmon run
size declined to 441 fish in 1990 and to 191 fish in 1991. The estimated 1991 run size of 191 fish was primarily the result
of surviving progeny from the 1988 spawning population of 2,085 fish. Thus, the 1991 spawning escapement represented
nearly a 90 percent decline in a single generation, and suggested that the 1988 year class was nearly a total failure
(57 FR 27416).

In 1992, the CDFG estimated that the winter-run chinook salmon run size increased to 1,180 fish. This run size was substantially
higher than the runs estimated in 1989 (547 fish), 1990 (441 fish), and 1991 (191 fish), and it represented more than
a 100 percent increase in the spawning population in a single successive generation since the 1992 run was comprised
primarily of the surviving progeny from the 1989 run. In 1989, the Bureau implemented conservation measures to manage
upper Sacramento River water temperatures and provide improved fish passage at the Red Bluff. As a result of these
actions, temperature conditions were much improved with favorable water temperatures occurring from Keswick Dam
to Bend Bridge (44 miles downstream) during almost the entire spawning and egg incubation period. Spawning ground
surveys in 1989 also indicated that nearly 100 percent of the estimated run spawned in this 44-mile river reach where
water temperature was favorable. As a result of these factors, temperature-related mortality was minimal in 1989.
The substantial increase in the 1992 run size suggests that the measures implemented to protect winter-run chinook
salmon in 1989 were effective, and that similar or more protective measures may be successful in the future. 
In 1993, the CDFG estimated the winter-run chinook salmon run size to be 341 fish. This represented nearly a 30 percent
decline of the run size in one generation. NMFS had anticipated that the run size would likely decline in 1993 because
the 1990 spawning population (441 fish) experienced less favorable water temperature conditions during spawning
and egg incubation, and more of the run spawned downstream from the river reach where temperatures could be suitably
managed by the Bureau. In 1990, as a result of continued drought conditions and high ambient temperatures, favorable
water temperatures for spawning and egg incubation were present only from Keswick Dam to the Balls Ferry Bridge (26
miles downstream) during a portion of the egg incubation period. In addition, spawning distribution surveys indicated
that nearly 10 percent of the run spawned downstream from Balls Ferry where temperatures were not favorable. Therefore,
temperature-related mortality was substantially higher in 1990 than in 1989. In addition to less favorable temperature
conditions, it is possible that conditions for outmigrants were less than favorable, and that ocean survival of the
1990 year class was reduced by the El Nino event that began in 1991-92. 
Since the winter-run chinook salmon was formally listed as threatened in November 1990 (55 FR 46515), the species
run size has continued to decline, with the exception of 1992, and exhibit considerable variability (Table 1). Although
some protective measures were implemented beginning in 1987, this decline was exacerbated by the 6-year drought
in California (1987-1992). Based on the run size estimates for the last 3 years (1991-1993), the population
now has two weak year classes (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the 1994 run will also be weak because of the weak 1991
year class (191 fish) and the less than favorable conditions for spawning, egg incubation, and juvenile outmigration
that occurred in 1991-92. Because of the small run in 1991 and the weak return expected in 1994, this year class
is likely to remain weakened for some time. 
As part of the status review, extinction probabilities were estimated for the winter-run chinook salmon population
using modifications of the model described by Dennis, Munholland, and Scott (1991), and the 3-year geometric moving
average of the annual estimated run size for the periods of 1967-1993 and 1979 1993, respectively. Results of
the analysis indicate that if past trends continue, the population faces a high probability of dropping below 100
spawners per year at least once over the next 
10 years, and to even lower levels over the 50 and 100 year time horizons. 
The extinction modeling results suggest that the risk of the winter-run chinook salmon population dropping to unacceptably
low levels is high. However, this type of analysis is based only on historical trends in the population (1967-1993)
and assumes that past conditions will continue in the future. Although the 1994 run is expected to be weak, NMFS believes
that conditions for winter-run chinook salmon were substantially improved in 1992 and 1993 because of long-term
protective measures implemented to reduce impacts of Central Valley and State Water Project operations and improve
conditions for successful egg incubation, rearing, and outmigration, and the end of the drought. In addition to these
protective measures, the FWS has been supplementing the natural production of juveniles with substantial numbers
of hatchery produced fish. If these protective measures and supplementation efforts prove to be effective, run sizes
in 1995 and 1996 will likely increase. For these reasons, the probability of the population declining to low levels
is probably less than suggested by the extinction modeling analysis. However, because the effectiveness of these
recently implemented protective measures and supplementation efforts is unknown and cannot be assessed until future
runs return, there remains substantial risk that the population is in danger of extinction. 


Summary of Comments 


The World Wildlife Fund supported the reclassification and also encouraged NMFS to develop and implement a recovery
plan for the conservation of Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The Department of the Interior (Interior)
also supported the reclassification of winter-run chinook salmon, and said the population remained at depressed
levels and may be in danger of extinction after the next two runs. However, Interior noted that the 1989 year class survived
particularly well and that the resulting 1992 run size of 1,180 adults represented more than a 100 percent increase
in size in a single successive generation. Interior also acknowledged that the 1992 increase in run size may indicate
that measures taken to protect the population in recent years may be effective. Interior also provided technical
comments to clarify and update facts contained in the proposed rule. 
The Westlands Water District, the Family Water Alliance, and the Glenn County Board of Supervisors all opposed reclassifying
winter-run chinook salmon because of protective measures that have been recently implemented. They said that the
threatened status should be retained until the effectiveness of these measures has been assessed.

Response to Comments 


NMFS agrees with the World Wildlife Fund that development and implementation of a recovery plan is essential for the
conservation and recovery of winter-run chinook salmon. For this reason, NMFS has appointed a National Sacramento
River winter-run chinook salmon recovery team, comprised of fishery resource mangers, experts on winter-run chinook
salmon biology, and conservation biology specialists, to develop a recovery plan. The recovery team has been meeting
since September 1992 and will submit a draft recovery plan to NMFS in 1994. Interior's technical comments were incorporated
where appropriate. 
NMFS disagrees with the comments of the Westlands Water District, the Family Water Alliance, and the Glenn County
Board of Supervisors that current protective measures should be allowed to be in place for a certain amount of time
and their effectiveness evaluated before NMFS determines whether reclassification is necessary. Although measures
have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on winter-run chinook salmon, and NMFS believes they are likely to
be effective, their effectiveness is currently unknown and cannot be evaluated until data on future returns are available.

One of the factors to be considered in listing, delisting and reclassifying a species is ``the inadequacy of existing
regulatory mechanisms.'' Judicial interpretation of this language allows NMFS to also consider the ``adequacy''
of regulatory mechanisms in its listing decisions. It is premature to determine the adequacy of these measures for
purposes of this reclassification. Most measures will not demonstrate positive results until the 1996 return of
adult winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS must determine whether reclassification is justified on the basis of the current
status of the population and the factors affecting its continued existence. 


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA specifies five criteria to be evaluated in reviewing the status of a species or population
proposed for listing or reclassification. The following discussion is in addition to the evaluation of these factors
in the proposed rulemaking to reclassify winter-run chinook salmon as an endangered species (57 FR 27416, June 19,
1992), the first Notice of Determination (52 FR 6041, February 27, 1987), a subsequent Notice of Determination (53
FR 49722, December 19, 1987), two emergency rules (54 FR 32088, August 4, 1989 and 55 FR 12193, April 2, 1990), the proposed
rule to list winter-run chinook salmon as threatened (55 FR 10260, March 20, 1990), and the final rule listing the species
as threatened (55 FR 46515, November 5, 1990). 



1. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of its Habitat or Range



Modification and loss of spawning and rearing habitat have been major factors contributing to the decline of the winter-run
chinook salmon. 


Shasta and Keswick Dams


On February 12, 1993, NMFS issued a biological opinion and incidental take statement to the Bureau of Reclamation
which concluded that long-term operations of the Federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project would
jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. The opinion identifies a reasonable and prudent
alternative with measures designed to protect winter-run chinook salmon from the long-term operations of Shasta
and Keswick Dams, as well as other facilities of the Central Valley Project. Implementation of these measures is expected
to substantially improve water temperature and flow conditions in the upper Sacramento River for winter-run chinook
salmon spawning, incubation, and rearing. The specific measures contained in the reasonable and prudent alternative
that relate to Shasta and Keswick Dams require the Bureau to (1) use a more conservative forecasting approach to determine
the annual allocation of deliverable water stored in Shasta Reservoir, (2) maintain a minimum end-of-water-year
carryover storage in Shasta Reservoir (1.9 million acre-feet) for most water year types, (3) maintain daily average
water temperatures in the winter-run chinook salmon spawning grounds below Keswick Dam at no more than 56 degrees
Fahrenheit from April 15 through August 31 and at no more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit from October 1 through October
31, (4) maintain a minimum flow of 3,250 cubic feet per second (cfs) from Keswick Dam from October 1 through March 31,
and (5) reduce releases from Keswick Dam according to specific criteria from July 1 through March 31. The reasonable
and prudent alternative identified specific temperature control points in the upper Sacramento River for various
operating scenarios based on the water year type and reservoir storage conditions at the start of the water year.

Based on forecasted water supplies and reservoir storage conditions in February and March 1993, the Bureau met the
reasonable and prudent alternative requirement to maintain water temperatures at or below 56 degrees Fahrenheit
throughout the entire winter-run chinook salmon spawning and incubation season from Keswick Dam to Bend Bridge.
The CDFG conducted numerous aerial surveys of redd (nests) counts during the winter-run chinook spawning period
and observed an unusually large number of redds (in proportion to the estimated run size) due to excellent viewing
conditions in the river. Based on these surveys, virtually all redds were observed in the vicinity of Redding well
upstream from Ball's Ferry. Two redds were observed between Ball's Ferry and the Bend Bridge temperature control
point, and only a single redd was observed below Bend Bridge (immediately downstream from the Red Bluff Diversion
Dam). As a result of the temperature control maintained by the Bureau and the distribution of spawners in the river,
the incremental impact of temperature on winter-run chinook salmon egg and juvenile survival was minimal in 1993.
In addition to providing temperature control during the 1993 spawning, incubation, and rearing season, the Bureau's
operations in 1993 resulted in an end-of-water-year Shasta Reservoir storage (in excess of 3.0 million acre-feet)
that far exceeded the requirements of the reasonable and prudent alternative. 
The incidental take statement issued with the February 1993, long-term CVP biological opinion also contains specific
measures that must be implemented to minimize the effects of Shasta and Keswick Dam operations on winter-run chinook
salmon incidental take. These measures include (1) the continuation and expansion of temperature monitoring in
the upper Sacramento River to ensure compliance with the temperature criteria, (2) NMFS review of the Bureau's proposed
water allocation plans before delivery commitments are made each year to determine their potential effects on upper
river water temperatures, and (3) monitoring in the upper river when Keswick Dam releases are reduced to prevent the
stranding of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon. These measures were implemented by the Bureau as required by the
incidental take statement. 
Spawning habitat utilized by winter-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento River has also been degraded by decreases
in the rate of replenishment for gravel suitable for spawning (NMFS 1992c). In 1990, the California Department of
Water Resources placed 100,000 cubic yards of spawning gravel in the upper Sacramento River between Salt Creek and
Clear Creek to restore degraded spawning riffles in areas of the river used by winter-run chinook salmon. The FWS has
been evaluating these gravel restoration efforts and issued progress reports in 1992 and 1993. Thus far, the majority
of the gravel remains where it was originally placed because flows have not reached rates great enough to disperse
it in the upper river. Studies by the FWS are expected to continue through at least 1993 with a final report on the program
expected in 1994. 
Adult winter-run chinook salmon can also be adversely impacted by operation of the Keswick Dam stilling basin. Overflow
of water from the stilling basin during operation of the spillway attracts upstream migrating adult salmon into the
basin at the base of the Dam where they become trapped. The CDFG and FWS have conducted fish rescue operations at the
stilling basin and removed hundreds of trapped salmon. Until the facility is structurally modified to allow fish
free passage back to the river, it is likely that some adult winter-run chinook salmon will be lost. To remedy this long-standing
problem, the incidental take statement issued with NMFS' February 12, 1993, biological opinion requires the Bureau
to structurally modify the stilling basin by no later than December 31, 1993, so that adult winter-run chinook salmon
will be able to freely pass from the basin back into the Sacramento River. NMFS and the Bureau have been meeting to discuss
and evaluate alternative methods of correcting the problems with the stilling basin. 


Red Bluff Diversion Dam


Another serious habitat concern for winter-run chinook salmon is the impediment to adult upstream migration caused
by the Bureau's operation of this dam on the Sacramento River. Operation of the dam and the associated Tehama-Colusa
Canal also adversely impacts juvenile winter-run chinook salmon migrating downstream past the facility. Impacts
of the dam and its operations are discussed in the February 12, 1993, biological opinion addressing long-term operations
of the Central Valley and State Water Projects. 
The 1993 biological opinion also includes specific measures to minimize the impact of gate operations at Red Bluff
Diversion Dam on both the upstream passage of adult winter-run chinook salmon and the downstream passage of juveniles.
These measures require the Bureau to maintain the dam gates in the raised position at least through April 30, 1993,
and from November 1, 1993, through at least April 30, 1994. After the Bureau's proposed pilot pumping project is operational
in 1994, the Bureau must raise the dam gates from September 15 through at least May 14 in all subsequent years. Operation
of dam gates in accordance with this schedule is expected to provide unimpeded access to upper river spawning habitat
for most migrating adults and substantially reduce losses of downstream migrating juveniles due to predation. The
Bureau maintained the dam gates in the raised position through April 30, 1993. In a effort to provide additional protection
for outmigrating juveniles in 1993, the 
Bureau raised the dam gates in mid-October rather than on November 1 as required by the reasonable and prudent alternative.

Operation of the Tehama-Colusa Canal water diversion facilities associated with Red Bluff Diversion Dam before
1990 also adversely affected juvenile winter-run chinook salmon during their outmigration. To improve operation
of the dam and canal and to reduce impacts to juvenile salmonids, including winter-run chinook salmon, the Bureau
installed ``state-of-the-art'' drum screens and a bypass system at the canal headworks in 1990. Studies conducted
to date indicate that the entrainment problem has been greatly diminished by the new screens. FWS is expected to publish
a report in 1993 summarizing the results of monitoring and evaluation studies conducted in 1992. Additional studies,
including monitoring of entrainment and an evaluation of mortality associated with the bypass system is anticipated
in 1993. The February 1993 biological opinion for long-term CVP operations requires the Bureau to develop and implement
a program to evaluate the fish bypass facilities, and correct any identified problems. This evaluation has not been
completed. 
The Bureau, in conjunction with Federal and state fishery agencies, has been evaluating various alternatives to
the existing facilities at Red Bluff Diversion Dam. The Bureau published an appraisal report in 1992 that identified
and analyzed several alternatives for improving fish passage at the dam. Among the four most reasonable alternatives
identified in the appraisal report, two involve installation of a new pumping plant based on the Archimedes screw
design. The Bureau has postponed final selection of a preferred alternative until experimental data are collected
and analyzed from a pilot pumping plant that will be constructed downstream from the dam in 1994. 
The pilot pumping plant that the Bureau has proposed to install at the dam will consist of three large pumps to be located
on the west bank of the Sacramento River immediately downstream from the dam. Two of the pumps will be closed Archimedes
pumps and the third will be a helical style pump, with each having approximately a 100 cfs capacity. This pilot program
is intended to evaluate the pump design and operation, and to allow the Bureau to meet irrigation demands in the Tehama-Colusa
Canal service area while maintaining the dam gates in the raised position. NMFS conducted an ESA section 7 consultation
with the Bureau on the pilot pumping project and issued a biological opinion and incidental take statement in February
1993 which requires the Bureau to conduct an extensive monitoring program to evaluate the effects of fish passage
by the pumps and assess the level of taking. Consultation was reinitiated in June 1993 to address modifications in
the design, construction, and operations of the pumping facility that would delay eventual operation from October
1993 to December 1994. 


Pollution 


Pollution in the Sacramento River has also degraded winter-run chinook salmon spawning and rearing habitat. In particular,
NMFS is concerned about the effects on adult and juvenile winter-run chinook salmon from runoff entering the upper
Sacramento River that is contaminated by heavy metals leached from inactive mining sites at Iron Mountain Mine (IMM).
Heavy metal concentrations from this runoff can reach levels that are lethal to winter-run chinook salmon eggs and
juveniles. Metal-laden runoff that flows from IMM into the Spring Creek drainage is impounded behind the Spring Creek
Debris Dam operated by the Bureau. The Bureau generally operates this dam to control the release of contaminated Spring
Creek flow in conjunction with dilution releases from Shasta and Whiskeytown Reservoirs. The Bureau is expected
to continue controlling releases from Spring Creek Debris Dam in this manner until source control and/or 
cleanup can be achieved. 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed IMM on the Superfund Priority List, and the State of California
and EPA are continuing to evaluate options for the long-term control of contaminants originating from the IMM complex.
Based on an memorandum of Agreement between the Bureau and EPA, the Bureau will develop a plan to enlarge Spring Creek
Debris Dam to provide additional storage for IMM effluent. EPA also issued a Record of Decision on September 30, 1992,
identifying an interim remedial action plan to clean up hazardous substances in the Boulder Creek Operable Unit at
the IMM site. The remedial action involves the collection and treatment of acid mine drainage discharges from the
Richmond and Lawson portals at IMM, and the excavation and capping of existing waste piles that are eroding and discharging
into Boulder Creek and subsequently Spring Creek and the upper Sacramento River. The Richmond and Lawson portals
are the two largest sources of hazardous materials at the IMM site and represent the sources for nearly 40 percent of
the copper and 80 percent of the cadmium and zinc leached from IMM and discharged into tributaries leading to the Sacramento
River. In addition to these activities, the EPA is moving forward with plans to study several remaining sources of
contamination at IMM and identify appropriate remedial actions. 
The 1993 biological opinion to the Bureau also addressed contamination from IMM. The opinion's incidental take statement
requires the Bureau to operate Spring Creek Debris Dam and Shasta Dam so as to minimize the chronic exposure of adult
and juvenile winter-run chinook salmon to heavy metal concentrations and eliminate the potential scouring of metal
laden sediments from Keswick Reservoir.

NMFS has previously expressed concern that outmigrating juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may be adversely impacted
by the disposal of contaminated dredge sediments at disposal sites located in the San Francisco Bay area. The residence
time for outmigrating winter-run chinook salmon through the Bay is thought to range from 1 week to more than 2 months
depending on the water year type. Prey organisms utilized by juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may bioaccumulate
contaminants originating from in-bay disposal of contaminated dredge sediments, thereby exposing juveniles to
these contaminants as they forage and migrate through the Bay. 
Although NMFS continues to be concerned about the potential effects of in-bay disposal, the Corps has taken recent
action to ensure that in-bay disposal of contaminated materials does not occur. In June 1992, the Corps, EPA, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission published proposed
interim testing guidelines for dredged sediments that would be disposed of at in-bay sites. On February 1, 1993, the
Corps formally adopted these guidelines in Public Notice 93-2. These interim testing guidelines are designed
to ensure that sufficient information is available to characterize sediments to be dredged for all projects so that
disposal does not result in chemical or biological degradation of the disposal site. These guidelines are intended
to apply to all open water disposal projects until a long-term plan for managing dredged sediments in the San Francisco
Bay area is developed and implemented. 
Although the interim testing guidelines adopted by the Corps represent an important short-term action aimed at preventing
the in-bay disposal of contaminated sediments, NMFS believes it is essential that a long-term strategy be developed
and implemented for San Francisco Bay area dredging and disposal activities. To meet this need, the Corps and several
other Federal, state and local agencies, including NMFS, are developing a Long-Term Management Strategy (LTMS)
for managing dredging and disposal activities. The LTMS is designed to provide appropriate dredged material disposal
alternatives for a 50-year planning horizon through the designation of ocean, in-bay, and upland disposal sites
and the identification of beneficial reuse options. Implementation of the LTMS management programs is anticipated
to begin in August 1994. 


Bank Stabilization


Bank stabilization projects in the Sacramento River are believed to adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon
rearing habitat. The Corp of Engineers has developed the Sacramento River Bank Protection Project as a long-range
program for construction of bank erosion control works. On October 28, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion to the
Corps that concluded Phase II of the project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook
salmon. However, the incidental take statement issued with the opinion requires the Corps to select the least damaging
bank stabilization methods available and to provide NMFS with detailed mitigation plans for each bank protection
project in Phase II that would adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon habitat. Based on recent information developed
by the FWS concerning bank protection methods that minimize impacts and the importance of protecting shaded riverine
aquatic habitat, NMFS requested the Corps to reinitiate consultation on Phase II of the project in late 1992. The Corps
is currently developing additional environmental documentation for the remaining Phase II bank protection projects,
and NMFS anticipates that further consultation will be initiated when that documentation is completed.

2. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or Educational Purposes 



Commercial and Recreational Fishing



In 1991, NMFS consulted with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) pursuant to section 7 of the ESA to evaluate
the potential effects of the proposed Pacific Ocean Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP) on winter-run chinook salmon.
A biological opinion was issued to the PFMC on March 1, 1991, that concluded management of the salmon fishery under
the Pacific Ocean Salmon FMP was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. An
incidental take statement was also issued with the opinion that authorized a limited incidental take of winter-run
chinook salmon by the ocean fishery (NMFS 1991b). NMFS has also consulted with the Council concerning implementation
of Amendment 4 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP. The opinion issued by NMFS concluded that implementation of the
FMP would not jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon as a result of incidental bycatch of
salmon in the fishery. NMFS will continue to consult internally and with the PFMC, as appropriate, to ensure that ocean
salmon and other fishery management actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon.


Since 1987, the CDFG has implemented seasonal fishing closures in the upper Sacramento River and monitored the recreational
salmon catch. In 1990, the California Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations that prohibited the retention
of salmon in the Sacramento River when adult winter-run chinook salmon are present. This closure has virtually eliminated
the taking of winter-run chinook salmon by recreational fishermen. NMFS will continue to coordinate with CDFG concerning
in-river fishing restrictions. 



Scientific Studies



In 1991, NMFS issued an ESA section 10 scientific research permit to the FWS to conduct several scientific research
studies on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The FWS's Northern Central Valley Fishery Resource Office
published a report in early 1993 summarizing their 1992 activities under the permit. The results from the juvenile
monitoring program, the hatchery propagation program, and the temperature tolerance experiments are expected
to significantly contribute to NMFS efforts to protect and recover winter-run chinook salmon. 

CDFG and FWS also conduct annual spawning distribution surveys of winter-run chinook salmon in the upper Sacramento
River and develop estimates of the annual spawning run size based on counts of fish passing the dam. CDFG conducts aerial
surveys each year to count winter-run chinook spawning redds and determine their distribution in the upper River.
The FWS also counts winter-run chinook salmon redds in an index area in the vicinity of Redding. 

In March 1993, NMFS modified the FWS's scientific research to authorize the directed take and sacrifice of coded-wire
tagged winter-run chinook juveniles produced at Coleman National Fish Hatchery and collected during monitoring
studies in the Sacramento River, the Delta, and at the State and Federal water export facilities in the southern Delta.
The purpose of the study was to determine growth rates of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon produced at the hatchery
and released into the wild, and to help verify the size criteria developed by CDFG to separate and identify juvenile
chinook salmon by race. 

Under the terms of the May 1988 Ten Point Restoration Plan for winter-run chinook salmon, the FWS agreed to fund and
implement a winter-run chinook salmon propagation program at the hatchery. Prior to 1991, this program was unsuccessful.
However, in 1991 the FWS was able to successfully hold and spawn six female winter-run chinook salmon despite the low
numbers of fish available (only 22), and produce and release about 11,000 juveniles into the Sacramento River near
Redding, California. In 1992, the winter-run chinook salmon spawning run size was substantially higher (1,180 fish),
more adults were collected for broodstock use, and a total of approximately 28,000 juvenile winter-run chinook salmon
with tags were released into the upper Sacramento River in late January 1993. The FWS continued this program in 1993
using approximately 17 wild adults and is currently rearing in excess of 20,000 juveniles at the hatchery. The surviving
juveniles will eventually be tagged and released into the upper Sacramento. This marking program is expected to provide
information on the timing of winter-run chinook salmon outmigration and growth. In addition, marked fish that return
to the upper Sacramento River to spawn in the future will be easily distinguishable from wild fish, thereby allowing
the FWS to assess the effectiveness of this supplementation program and ensure that hatchery produced adults are
not mated with each other. The marking program may also provide additional information concerning the ocean harvest
of winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS is currently conducting a section 7 consultation with the FWS to address the long-term
effects of this propagation program, as well as a proposed captive broodstock program, and other existing propagation
programs at the hatchery, on the wild winter-run chinook salmon population. NMFS expects to conclude consultation
and issue a biological opinion to the FWS before the end of 1993.

In April 1992, FWS applied for a modification to its scientific research permit in order to initiate a captive breeding
program using about 1,000 juveniles that remained from the hatchery propagation effort in 1991. A primary objective
of this program was to provide insurance against extinction or loss of unique genetic variability until the wild winter-run
chinook salmon population began to recover. The goal of the program is to produce about 200 mature broodstock for each
of three consecutive years beginning in 1994. 
The FWS transferred approximately 750 of the juveniles produced from adults captured during the 1991 spawning run
to the University of California's Bodega Marine Laboratory in September 1992 for extended captive rearing. A small
number of these juveniles (approximately 50) were subsequently transferred to Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco
during March 1993 for further rearing and display. Additional juveniles produced from adults collected and spawned
in 1992 were transferred from the hatchery to Bodega Marine Laboratory for extended rearing in February 1993. As of
September 1993, the Bodega Marine Lab was rearing approximately 425 fish from the 1991 broodyear and approximately
640 fish from the 1992 broodyear. A portion of the surviving adults produced from the 1991 and 1992 broodyears may eventually
be returned to the hatchery for use as broodstock. However, these captively reared adults will not be used in any matings
nor can their progeny be released into the wild until after NMFS and FWS have concluded the ongoing section 7 consultation
that is addressing the potential adverse effects of the captive broodstock program on wild fish, and NMFS has amended
the FWS's existing ESA section 10 research and propagation permit. 


3. Disease or Predation



The magnitude and extent of predation on winter-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento River and Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta are poorly known. However, studies by the FWS have found that predation at Red Bluff Diversion Dam, primarily
by squawfish, significantly contributes to the mortality of downstream winter-run chinook salmon migrants. The
FWS has undertaken periodic electrofishing below the dam which may be useful in developing a relative squawfish abundance
index. All of the fisheries agencies believe that before squawfish control is possible, more must be learned about
their life history. In 1992, the FWS conducted limited studies of predation at the fish bypass outfall as part of its
continuing evaluation of the dam and the new screens that were installed in 1990. 
NMFS has addressed this problem, in part, by requiring the Bureau, through the 1993 biological opinion on long-term
operations of the Central Valley Project, to maintain the Red Bluff Diversion Dam gates in the raised position during
most of the outmigration period. This action is expected to reduce substantially the adverse effects of predation
at the dam on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon. 
The potential for high levels of predation on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon also exist at the Glen-Colusa Irrigation
District (GCID) diversion facility and other manmade structures such as the California Department of Water Resource's
Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Structure and Clifton Court Forebay in the southern Delta. Predation studies conducted
by the CDFG in forebay indicate that the pre-screening mortality of marked salmonids, primarily due to predation
by striped bass, is approximately 75 percent. Squawfish and striped bass predation has also been observed on juvenile
salmonids released back into the Sacramento River from salvage operations conducted by the CDFG at State and Federal
fish protection facilities in the lower Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

The CDFG is conducting an extensive ongoing program to assess the abundance of predators in the forebay, remove predators
by means of gill nets and other fishing gear, and investigate and evaluate all factors that are thought to contribute
to pre-screening losses of juvenile salmonids. The February 1993 opinion on long-term operation of the CVP indirectly
address predation in the forebay by limiting the combined incidental take of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon
at the State and Federal facilities to 1 percent of the annual estimated juvenile production. In addition, implementation
of specific measures contained in the opinion's reasonable and prudent alternative, such as closure of the Delta
Cross Channel and reverse flow criteria in the western Delta, is expected to limit the diversion of juvenile winter-run
chinook salmon from the Sacramento River and their subsequent exposure to predation in the Delta and possibly Clifton
Court Forebay. 
The CDFG began a large-scale program of stocking hatchery-reared striped bass in 1981 through the Striped Bass Stamp
Program authorized that year. Approximately 60,000 yearling bass were stocked that year, and the program increased
substantially in subsequent years. Beginning in 1984, the program expanded to include several private hatcheries
and two state facilities. Between 1982 and 1990, the program raised and planted nearly 3.0 million juvenile striped
bass. Additionally, privately reared yearling bass have purchased and stocked by the State's Department of Water
Resources and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company as mitigation for fish losses at their facilities in the Delta.
Since 1984, the company has purchased and stocked over 2.5 million juvenile bass, and the State has stocked almost
5.0 million juvenile bass since 1988. 
Several groups raised concerns in 1992 about the possible effects of CDFG's striped bass enhancement and management
program on winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS reviewed CDFG's proposed enhancement program for 1992 and recommended
several changes, as well as the implementation of studies designed to assess the magnitude of striped bass predation
on winter-run chinook salmon. As a result of these and other concerns, CDFG eventually decided to suspend the planting
of hatchery-reared striped bass in Delta waters in 1992. In June 1993, NMFS requested that CDFG delay further release
of hatchery fish as part of its striped bass management program, and apply for an ESA section 10 incidental take permit.



4. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



In the final rule listing winter-run chinook salmon as threatened (55 FR 46515, November 5, 1990), NMFS concluded
that the existing regulatory mechanisms at that time were not adequate to recover the Sacramento River winter-run
chinook salmon. In the proposed rule reclassifying the species as endangered (57 FR 27416, June 19, 1992), NMFS concluded
that regulatory mechanisms might not have been sufficient or applied effectively. NMFS believes that measures currently
being taken by Federal agencies pursuant to their ESA section 7 obligations will reduce adverse impacts on the species.
However, these measures do not necessarily provide for the recovery of the species, but that the continued existence
of the species is not likely to be jeopardized. Further, the adequacy or inadequacy of these measures cannot be determined
until at least the 1996 return of adult salmon. 
In addition, NMFS believes that Title XXXIV of Public Law 102-575_Central Valley Project Improvement Act_which
was enacted by Congress in late 1992 will also contribute to the restoration and recovery of the winter-run chinook
salmon. Although that Act is intended to protect, restore, and enhance all fishery resources and habitats in the Central
Valley and Trinity River basins of California, the implementation of several provisions will directly benefit winter-run
chinook salmon and aid in its recovery. Several of the provisions are also expected to help implement actions that
NMFS has identified as necessary to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon and
ensure its eventual recovery. 
Provisions of the Act that have the most direct beneficial effect on winter-run chinook salmon are those requiring:
(1) Dedication of 800,000 acre-feet of CVP water for fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration purposes annually,

(2) Installation and operation of a temperature control device at Shasta Dam and modifications of CVP operations
to control water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River, 
(3) Development and implementation of measures at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam to minimize fish passage problems,

(4) Expansion of the FWS's existing hatchery facility, 
(5) Modification of the Keswick Dam fish trap and spillway to prevent trapping of fish, 
(6) Development and implementation of a continuing program to restore and replenish lost spawning gravel in the upper
Sacramento River, 
(7) Development and implementation of a program that provides for modified operations or new and improved control
structures at the Delta Cross Channel and Georgiana Slough, 
(8) Development and implementation of a program to resolve fish passage and stranding problems associated with operation
of the ACID dam, 
(9) Maintenance of minimum carryover storage in Sacramento and Trinity River reservoirs, 
(10) Design and construction, in conjunction with the State of California and other Federal agencies, of a new fish
protection structure at the GCID pumping facility near Hamilton City, and 
(11) Development and implementation, with the State of California, of measures to avoid losses of juvenile fish resulting
from unscreened or poorly screened diversions.

EPA is expected to propose, in December 1993, regulations that would set water quality standards for the San Francisco
Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay/Delta estuary. This is in response to EPA disapproving many elements of a water quality
control plan for salinity adopted in May 1991 by the California State Water Resources Control Board. The plan was disapproved
because it failed to adequately protect the estuarine habitat and its resources. NMFS is presently consulting with
EPA concerning the effects of the standards to be proposed on winter-run chinook salmon and its critical habitat.



5. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting the Continued Existence of the Species 


Unscreened Diversions and Entrainment



Juvenile winter-run chinook salmon are subject to entrainment by large numbers of unscreened or inadequately screened
diversions during their outmigration to the Pacific Ocean. These diversions range from small siphons diverting
20 cfs to the large export facilities operated by the Bureau and Department of Water Resources in the southern Delta
that have the combined capacity of pumping approximately 12,000 cfs of water daily. The magnitude of this impact is
currently unknown. 
Because of the potential impact from unscreened diversions, NMFS published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPR) on October 18, 1993, that stated NMFS is considering development of regulations that would establish screening
requirements for water diversions from the Sacramento River and the Delta to protect juvenile winter-run chinook
salmon. The ANPR also requested specific information and comments concerning the numbers, types, and sizes of diversions,
the magnitude of juvenile salmon losses at unscreened diversions, the feasibility of installing positive-barrier
fish screens to reduce losses, the estimated costs of screening and available funding mechanisms, and the availability
of alternative management options for reducing fish losses due to entrainment. NMFS will evaluate all information
and comments on the ANPR to determine whether to proceed with the development of screening regulations. 
In addition, the CDFG has begun an inventory of all existing water diversions on the Sacramento River and in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta to determine the number and size of unscreened diversions and identify high priority facilities requiring
screening. The Bureau, in conjunction with the State, has also established a demonstration screening program that
is expected to be implemented in 1994. This program was included as a measure to reduce taking of winter-run chinook
salmon in the incidental take statement that NMFS issued to the Bureau with the February 12, 1993, biological opinion
covering long-term CVP operations. The program is intended to promote the advancement of state-of-the-art positive
barrier screening technology at small (less than 40 cfs) unscreened diversions along the Sacramento River and within
Delta waterways. 


Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District



The Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) operates a diversion dam and two diversion facilities on the
upper Sacramento River near Redding, California. The larger of the two diversions is protected by a screen operated
and maintained by the CDFG. Until July 1992, the smaller Bonneyview water diversion facility (65 cfs capacity) was
unscreened.
In May 1992 the ACID applied for a Corps of Engineers (Corps) permit to install a screening structure at the Bonneyview
facility, and NMFS initiated section 7 consultation with the Corps to evaluate the effects of installing and operating
the structure on winter-run chinook salmon. The ACID obtained a Corps permit and installed an impervious barrier
with screens that was operational by early July 1992. Monitoring by CDFG in the irrigation canal behind the screening
structure in July and August 1992 demonstrated that the structure effectively eliminated the entrainment of juvenile
winter-run chinook salmon and other species. Subsequent dive inspections of the screening facility by the NMFS found
that the cleaning mechanism was working improperly. As a result, ACID personnel are now cleaning the screens manually
and are expected to work with NMFS and the screen manufacturer to develop an alternative cleaning mechanism. 


Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District



The GCID diversion facility located near Hamilton City, California, is the single largest diverter of water on the
Sacramento River with the capacity to take up to 3,000 cfs daily. Inadequate fish screens at the facility result in
the entrainment and impingement of juvenile salmon, including winter-run chinook salmon, that are dispersing in
the river system during the peak of the irrigation season. Since 1990, NMFS has used the section 7 and section 10 provisions
of ESA, together with direct legal action, in an 
effort to remedy the adverse effects of GCID water diversion operations on winter-run chinook salmon. 
On August 16, 1991, the U.S. District Court in Sacramento, California issued a temporary restraining order that required
GCID not to exceed a pumping rate of 1,100 cfs from August 19 to August 29, 1991. On January 9, 1992, the Court issued a
permanent injunction that completely enjoined GCID from diverting any water at the facility from July 15 through
November 30. The Court modified the permanent injunction in April 1992 to allow GCID to operate under the terms and
conditions of a joint stipulation that was agreed to by GCID, the Department of Justice, and the State of California.
Under the terms and conditions of the modified injunction, GCID was allowed to pump water on a restricted basis in 1992
in exchange for its 
commitment to implement a long-term solution to correct existing fish passage problems at the facility. 
Following completion of an ESA section 7 consultation and the issuance of a biological opinion from NMFS on June 5,
1992, the Corps issued a 1-year permit to GCID that authorized dredging and other construction activities that were
identified as terms and conditions in the modified the permanent injunction. GCID completed construction of a training
wall, reconfiguration of the lower oxbow leading back into the Sacramento River, and additional maintenance dredging
near the screens by mid-July 1992.

In September 1992, the Corps initiated consultation with NMFS concerning a new GCID permit application to conduct
maintenance dredging and other activities at its facility over a 3-year period (1993-95). On April 22, 1993,
NMFS concluded consultation and issued a jeopardy biological opinion and incidental take statement that limited
dredging in the upper oxbow, required maintenance of the training wall and pilot cut through the lower oxbow, limited
the permit duration to a period of 1 year, and required GCID to pursue a long-term solution for protecting winter-run
chinook salmon and correcting passage problems at the facility. Following issuance of the Corps permit, GCID conducted
maintenance dredging and other maintenance activities in accordance with the requirements of the biological opinion,
and subsequently began pumping water on a restricted basis beginning on August 1, 1993. 
The Department of Justice and GCID signed a new stipulated agreement in June 1993 that allowed operations to continue
in 1993. This new agreement, in conjunction with the biological opinion that was issued to the Corps, restricted pumping
activities at the Hamilton City facility, required various types of monitoring, and committed GCID to ensure the
implementation of long-term protective and conservation measures for winter-run chinook salmon at its Hamilton
City facility. 
In 1992, GCID, the State of California, and the Corps began a joint Federal and state environmental review process
to evaluate several long-term alternatives for correcting fish entrainment, impingement, and passage problems
at the GCID facility. The Bureau is now the lead Federal agency responsible for preparing the environmental documentation
and constructing the selected long-term protective and conservation measures due to the passage of the Central Valley
Improvement Act. The environmental review process has been delayed, but is expected to be completed by 
mid-1994. NMFS will consult with the Bureau to evaluate the effects of constructing and operating the selected long-term
protection alternative on winter-run chinook salmon. 


Delta Export Facilities of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project



The Bureau and the California Department of Water Resources operate facilities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
to convey Sacramento River water into and through the Delta and to export water out of the Delta. These facilities include
the Delta Cross Channel operated by the Bureau, and water export and fish protection facilities operated by the Bureau
(Tracy Pumping Plant) and California Department of Water Resources (Byron Pumping Plant). The operations of these
and other Central Valley and State water facilities, which are coordinated through the Coordinated Operations Agreement
between the Bureau and the State, can adversely impact winter-run chinook salmon. 
To address the potential adverse effects of gate operations on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon survival in 1992,
NMFS included a reasonable and prudent alternative measure in the February 14, 1992, biological opinion for 1992
CVP operations requiring the Bureau to close the Delta Cross Channel from February 1 through May 1, 1992. This action
was expected to substantially reduce the diversion of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon into the Delta from the
Sacramento River, especially with the extremely critical water supply and low export pumping rates that were anticipated
to occur in 1992. Operation of the Federal and State export facilities in 1992 was not expected to incidentally take
more than a small percentage of the 1991 winter-run chinook salmon outmigrant population. 
However, based on monitoring at these facilities during February and March 1992, NMFS determined that the taking
of juveniles exceeded the amount identified in the incidental take statement, and requested consultation be reinitiated.
After further consultation with the Bureau and the State was completed, NMFS amended the incidental take statement
to restrict the combined daily water export rate from both facilities to 1,200 cfs during the remainder of April 1992.
The amended take statement also required that consultation be reinitiated if the incidental take of juveniles exceeded
400 fish during this period or there was evidence to indicate that winter-run outmigration would substantially continue
beyond April 30, 1992, and required both the Bureau and the State to support efforts to develop a more refined and accurate
method for determining the level of taking incidental to pumping operations at the water export facilities. 
Because the losses of juvenile fish at these facilities were higher than expected in the spring of 1992, NMFS and the
CDFG established a Delta Salvage and Loss Working Group consisting of representatives from NMFS, FWS, the California
Departments of Fish and Game and Water Resources, and the Bureau. The objectives of this group were to (1) review and
refine the juvenile winter-run chinook salmon loss estimates at the water export facilities during the 1992 outmigration
period, and (2) evaluate the loss estimation and reporting procedures used in 1992 and make recommendations for improving
the procedures for 1993 and future years. The group met frequently to discuss these issues and issued a summary report
in September 1992 that included a revised estimate of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon losses in 1992 and a series
of recommendations for loss estimation and reporting. The loss estimation and reporting procedures developed by
this group were eventually incorporated into the February 12, 1993, biological opinion and incidental take statement
that NMFS issued to the Bureau on the long-term operations of the Federal and State water projects.

The biological opinion also includes protective measures designed to reduce the impact of Delta operations on winter-run
chinook salmon. The reasonable and prudent alternative in the opinion contains the following measures to avoid jeopardizing
the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon: (1) Closure of the Delta Cross Channel each year from February
1 through April 30; (2) operation of the cross channel gate each year from October 1 through January 31 to minimize the
diversion of juveniles into the Delta based on the use of a real-time monitoring program; (3) operation of the delta
water export facilities each year to ensure that no reverse flow conditions occur in the western Delta from February
1 through April 30; (4) operation of the delta export facilities each year to ensure that reverse flow conditions are
minimized from November 1 through January 31; and (5) monitoring of winter-run chinook incidental take at the Federal
and State export facilities. The incidental take statement included with the opinion also contains measures designed
to minimize the taking of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon incidental to the operation of the water export facilities.
This take statement identifies the level of incidental taking by the Bureau and State export facilities to be no more
than 1 percent of the estimated number of outmigrant juvenile winter-run chinook salmon entering the Delta in any
year, and requires the Bureau and the State to submit daily, weekly, and annual reports based on an extensive monitoring
program to ensure the incidental take authorization is not exceeded. 
Based on the 1992 run size estimate (1,180 fish), NMFS determined that the allowable take of outmigrating juvenile
winter-run chinook salmon incidental to operation of the export facilities in 1992-93 was 2,700 fish. Monitoring
of winter-run chinook salmon incidental take during the 1993 outmigration season indicated that the level of taking
was substantially higher at the State export facility than at the Federal export facility. The monitoring program
also indicated that the rate of taking by mid-February 1993 was higher than anticipated, and that continued high pumping
rates could result in exceeding the annual take level authorized by NMFS. As a result, the State voluntarily curtailed
pumping at its Delta pumping facility in late February to reduce the loss rate and cumulative loss of juvenile winter-run
chinook salmon at its facility. Although pumping rates were gradually increased during March and April 1993 at the
State facility, the cumulative loss of juveniles was less than 1 percent of the estimated outmigrant population in
1993. As a result of these and other actions taken by the State and Bureau in accordance with the February 12, 1993, biological
opinion and incidental take statement, NMFS believes that the survival of outmigrating juveniles in 1993 was significantly
improved over previous years. Continued implementation of these protective measures in future years is expected
to improve outmigration success of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon and aid in recovery. 


Suisun Marsh 


Operation of the Suisun Marsh salinity control gate structure by the State can potentially affect winter-run chinook
adversely by diverting outmigrating juveniles from the Sacramento River into Montezuma Slough where conditions
for survival are poorer because diverted fish have a longer migration route, and are exposed to increased water temperatures,
increased predation, and numerous unscreened water diversions. Upstream migrant adult winter-run chinook that
enter the downstream end of Montezuma Slough may also be blocked or delayed by operation of the gates as they attempt
to migrate into the Sacramento River. 
In order to minimize impacts on winter-run chinook salmon juveniles, NMFS required (in the 1992 CVP opinion) that
salinity control gates to either close from March 1 through April 15, or that unscreened diversions in the Slough not
operate during this period. The California Departments of Water Resources and Fish and Game conducted monitoring
during this period and provided documentation to NMFS that these diversions were not operated. However, sampling
by FWS during April 1992 also indicated that only a small percentage of marked juvenile salmonids (0.2-1.5 percent)
were diverted into Montezuma Slough. 
Since the potential impacts of operating the salinity control gates on winter-run chinook salmon are unclear based
on the available information, NMFS addressed the need for additional studies at the facility in the incidental take
statement included with the 1993 CVP biological opinion. Specifically, the incidental take statement requires
the Bureau and the State to develop and implement a program to evaluate the effects of operating the salinity control
structure on winter-run chinook salmon by spring 1994. The program is expected to assess the diversion rate of chinook
salmon juveniles into Montezuma Slough, predation at the structure, survival of juveniles passing through the slough,
and passage of adults upstream. 


Droughts/El Ni&ntilde;o 


The natural factors of greatest concern to NMFS are drought conditions and the oceanographic phenomenon known as
El Ni&ntilde;o. The effects of the extended 1987-1992 drought on California's water supply have likely exacerbated
the effects of management of State and Federal water operations and other activities on winter-run chinook salmon
over the past several years. However, the end of the drought in 1993 due to above normal levels of precipitation throughout
the State, and the implementation of protective measures contained in NMFS February 12, 1993, biological opinion
are expected to reduce the adverse effects of drought in future years by ensuring that minimum carryover storage is
maintained in Shasta Reservoir each year, and that conservative water supply forecasts are used by the Bureau to make
annual water allocation decisions. In addition to these measures, the Bureau is expected to construct a temperature
control device at Shasta Reservoir that should improve its ability to provide suitable water temperatures in the
upper Sacramento River. 
The El Ni&ntilde;o event that began in 1991-1992 may result in reduced ocean survival of winter-run chinook
salmon produced in 1990 and 1991 when the estimated run sizes were very low (441 and 191 fish respectively) and drought
conditions prevailed. For these and other reasons, NMFS anticipated that the 1993 run size would be low, and also expects
that the run size in 1994 will be weak. The only measure that may help to mitigate the impact of El Ni&ntilde;o events
may be the hatchery supplementation program developed by the FWS to augment natural juvenile production. If the hatchery
supplementation program proves to be successful, it may provide the necessary juvenile production to offset any
adverse effects of El Ni&ntilde;o conditions.

Conclusion 


Since the winter-run chinook salmon was formally listed as a threatened species in November 1990 (55 FR 46515), the
annual estimated run sizes have become more variable and have continued to decline with the exception of an increase
in 1992. Although some protective measures were implemented beginning in 1987, the decline was exacerbated by a 6-year
drought in California (1987-1992) and threats adversely affecting the species that were not addressed until
recently. Based on the run size estimates for the last 3 years (1991-1993), the population now has at least one
and possibly two extremely weak year classes (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the 1994 run will also be weak because
of the small numbers of adults returning in 1991 (191 fish) and less than favorable conditions for spawning, egg incubation,
and juvenile outmigration that occurred in 1991-92. This years class is likely to remain weakened for the foreseeable
future. 
Although conditions for winter-run chinook salmon began improving in 1992 and 1993 because of protective measures
implemented to reduce the long-term impacts of operations of the Federal and State water projects and improve conditions
for successful egg incubation, rearing, and outmigration, the 6-year drought ended, and the natural production
of juveniles is being supplemented with hatchery produced fish, NMFS believes that quantifiable improvements in
population levels are not likely to be evident for several years. Since the effectiveness of these recently implemented
protective measures and supplementation efforts is unknown and cannot be assessed until future runs return, there
remains substantial risk that the population is in danger of extinction. 
Based on the continued decline of the population and increased variability of run sizes since 1991, the expected weak
return in 1994, continuing threats to the population, and uncertainty about whether recently implemented protective
and conservation measures will be effective, NMFS believes that the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon
is in danger of becoming extinct and should be classified as an endangered species. NMFS will continue to monitor closely
the status of this population as well as evaluate the effectiveness of existing and future protective and conservation
measures to determine whether any further changes in its status are warranted. 



Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species that are listed under the ESA include listing, recovery actions, implementation
of certain protective measures, and designation and protection of critical habitat. Some of the most useful protective
measures are contained in section 7 of the ESA. Pursuant to section 7, Federal agencies are required to conduct conservation
programs for endangered species and to consult with NMFS regarding the potential effects of their actions on winter-run
chinook salmon. 
Since winter-run chinook salmon was originally listed as a threatened species on an emergency basis in August 1989,
NMFS has conducted numerous section 7 consultations with Federal agencies whose actions may affect the species.
The most significant consultations have been with the Bureau and the California Department of Water Resources concerning
the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project and the Corps concerning fish passage
at the GCID diversion facility at Hamilton City. NMFS is currently engaged in consultations with other Federal agencies
and will continue this process to determine whether Federal actions affect winter-run chinook salmon. 
Section 10 of the ESA provides for addressing the effects of private and state (non-Federal) actions on endangered
species. NMFS has worked with GCID to address the impacts of their major diversion facility on winter-run chinook
salmon through this process. NMFS also expects to work with the CDFG to address potentially adverse effects of striped
bass and salmon hatchery management on winter-run chinook salmon. In the future, NMFS will continue to pursue opportunities
to remedy private and non-Federal activities that may affect winter-run chinook salmon through this process. 
In 1992, NMFS established a National Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon recovery team to develop a recovery
plan for the species. The team is comprised of fishery resource managers, experts on winter-run chinook salmon biology
and, other conservation specialists. The recovery team meets frequently and expects to complete development of
a comprehensive draft recovery plan in 1994. 


Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the extent that it is prudent and determinable, critical habitat be
designated concurrently with the listing of a species. NMFS published a final rule designating critical habitat
for Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon on June 16, 1993. The designated critical habitat includes: the Sacramento
River from Keswick Dam (RM 302) to Chipps Island (RM 0) at the westward margin of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
all waters from Chipps Island westward to Carquinez Bridge, all waters of San Pablo Bay, and all waters in San Francisco
Bay north of the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge. The final rule also identifies those physical and biological features
of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of winter-run chinook salmon.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a final hazardous waste listing determination for wastes
generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in wood surface protection processes. Upon reviewing the
public comments received on its proposal of April 27, 1993, the Agency has decided not to list wastes from the use of
chlorophenolic formulations in wood surface protection processes. As a result of this determination, EPA is not
mandating in this rule any specific operating or information collection requirements for owners/operators of wood
surface protection plants. If, however, use of chlorophenolic formulations resumes in the future, the Agency would
very likely re-evaluate this decision not to list. This rule also finalizes the proposed amendment of SW-846
(``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'') to include Method 4010 (Immunoassay
Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol). In addition, the Agency is adding the following four chemicals to 40
CFR part 261, Appendix VIII: Sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol.

I. Legal Authority 



These regulations are being promulgated under the authority of sections 2002(a) and 3001(b) and (e)(1) of the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6921(b) and (e)(1), and 6922 (commonly referred to as RCRA). 




II. Background & Summary 



A. Background 



Under section 3001(e) of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA is required
to make a hazardous waste listing determination for wastes containing chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. As
part of this mandate, the Agency began an investigation in 1988 of dioxin-containing wastes from wood preserving
and wood surface protection processes. Three categories of wastes from wood preserving processes were listed as
hazardous wastes in 1990, (F032, F034, and F035, see 55 FR 50450). A final listing determination for wood surface protection
process wastes were deferred due to lack of data (53 FR 53282). In 1991, the Agency began a separate study of the surface
protection industry in an effort to obtain sufficient information upon which to base a hazardous waste listing determination.
The Agency, upon obtaining and evaluating information, published a proposed rule on April 27, 1993 which proposed
a concentration-based hazardous waste listing option and requested comment on an alternative option not to list
these wastes as hazardous (58 FR 25707). Details of the options can be found in the following section to this preamble.
A detailed summary of all Agency actions related to wood surface protection wastes was provided in the April 27, 1993
proposal (58 FR 25707). The reader is encouraged to consult that document for more information on the wood surface
protection rulemaking history. 

In accordance with a proposed consent decree signed by EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) in 

EDF

 v. 

Browner

 (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, case no. 89-0591), the Agency has agreed to make a final listing
determination for chlorophenolic wastes from wood surface protection processes by December 31, 1993. 




B. Summary of the Wood Surface Protection Regulation 



After considerable review and study of the rulemaking docket for this action, including comments received on the
proposal, the Agency has determined that listing as hazardous wastes from surface protection operations is unnecessary
and will not yield the benefits intended by a hazardous waste listing under the RCRA program. This section summarizes
elements of the proposed rule of April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25707), and details the conclusions reached in developing this
final rule. The reader is cautioned that although some of the highlights brought up in the proposed rule are described
below, the majority of information on the industry itself as well as the detailed risk assessment on which the initial
proposed rule was based is found in the preamble and background documents to the proposed rule. The information contained
in this final rule is primarily concerned with developments subsequent to the proposed rule. This rule describes,
in detail, the Agency's justification for not listing wastes from surface protection processes that use chlorophenolic
formulations. In addition, it summarizes the Agency's response to comments received on the proposal. 



III. Overview of the Proposed Rule 



The April 27, 1993 proposal discussed and requested comment on each of the following: 
(1) Proposing a concentration-based hazardous waste listing for certain wood surface protection wastes, 
(2) Proposing various testing, analysis, recordkeeping requirements and management standards for wood surface
protection plants, 
(3) Adding six hazardous constituents to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261, (4) Amending of appendix VII of 40 CFR part
261 by adding F033 and the hazardous constituents found in the wastes, 
(5) Modifying the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) list of hazardous
substances to reflect the newly proposed listing, 
(6) Amending SW-846 (``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'') to include
Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol), and 
(7) An alternative option not listing chlorophenolic wastes as hazardous. 

The Agency proposed to list as hazardous at 40 CFR 261.31 only those wastes from wood surface protection processes
using a formulation with a pentachlorophenate concentration greater than 0.1 ppm. Under this proposed option, surface
protection operations using formulations with pentachlorophenate concentrations equal to or less than 0.1 ppm
would not generate F033 listed wastes. The Agency proposed this concentration-based listing because it had information
which suggested that many surface protectors who previously used chlorophenolics did not sufficiently clean out
equipment prior to abandoning the use of chlorophenolics. Because of this, many formulations from past users of chlorophenolics
exhibit ``cross-contamination,'' the contamination of current formulations by dioxins and chlorophenolic compounds
from old formulations. The rule proposed the following hazardous waste listing description for the F033 waste code
and included the following specific waste streams from process operations: 




F033:Process residuals, wastewaters that come into contact with protectant, discarded spent formulation, and
protectant drippage from wood surface protection processes at plants that use surface protection chemicals having
an in-process formulation concentration of pentachlorophenate (expressed as pentachlorophenol during analysis)
exceeding 0.1 ppm. (T)

<DOCNO> FR940104-0-00054 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Along with this option, various testing and recordkeeping requirements were proposed. For an owner/operator to
demonstrate that he/she is not generating F033 wastes, EPA proposed formulation testing requirements for all surface
protection plants. All owner/operators of wood surface protection plants would be required to test their formulation
to determine the concentration of pentachlorophenate if the owner/operators wanted to avoid generating F033 wastes.
If the analysis showed a concentration at or below 0.1 ppm, the owner/operator would be required to sign a certification
to that effect and maintain records on site related to the testing procedure. This testing proposed an analysis using
a method listed within the EPA's Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods (SW-846).
The Agency proposed to add Method 4010 to SW-846. Method 4010 is an immunoassay test for the presence of pentachlorophenol,
which determines whether a sample is above or below a set limit (such as the 0.1 ppm concentration level proposed).


Under the proposal, if analysis showed that a facility's formulation contains pentachlorophenate at levels exceeding
0.1 ppm, then the wastes generated from surface protection at that facility would be F033 wastes and the owner/operator
would be subject to additional operating requirements proposed as subpart T of parts 264 and 265. For details on the
specific operating requirements, the reader should refer to the proposed notice (58 FR 25706). 

A number of the constituents of concern that are present in wastes generated from wood surface protection processes
which use chlorophenolic formulations do not appear on the list of hazardous constituents at 40 CFR part 261, appendix
VIII. The Agency proposed to add six hazardous constituents to appendix VIII: sodium pentachlorophenate, potassium
pentachlorophenate, the sodium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, the potassium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol,
octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF). 

Sodium and potassium pentachlorophenate are the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol. These salts were
proposed for addition to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 since, as a result of gastric secretions following ingestion,
the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol are readily converted to the
corresponding phenols by acidification. Therefore, the sodium and potassium salts are reasonably expected to elicit
the same health effects as the corresponding phenols. For this reason, the Agency proposed to add these four compounds
to the list of hazardous constituents in appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. 

The Agency also requested comment on an option not to list as hazardous wastes generated from surface protection processes.
The Agency included the so-called ``no-list'' option in the proposal because the future generation of chlorophenolic
wastes is expected to diminish rapidly to zero and because the results of risk analyses show that the risks from the
dominant exposure pathways are relatively modest, assuming the widespread use of chlorophenolic formulations
does not resume. The Agency believed at the time of the proposal that reintroduction of chlorophenolic formulations
into the market place in the future was not likely to occur. EPA also noted that the Agency would always have the option
of reconsidering the listing determination should chlorophenolic surface protection formulations be reintroduced
in the future.

IV. Summary of Public Comments and Responses 



Comments received on the proposed rule are placed under two separate headings for purposes of this summary. The first
addresses the more general comments associated with the proposal, including those relating to: (1) General implementation
issues of a listing for wastes generated by the wood surface protection industry; (2) technical approaches discussed
in the proposal relating to data sampling methodologies; and (3) various engineering assumptions on which the proposed
listing was based. The second part of this section describes the Agency's response to comments dealing with the risk
assessment methodology used to support the listing determination for these wastes. 



A. General Comments 



Several comments were submitted on the proposed listing of F033 wastes. Four commenters supported the listing in
general and two commenters supported the concentration-based approach in particular. Three commenters opposed
the proposed listing and urged EPA to rely on its authority under FIFRA to control the risks posed by chlorophenolic
formulations. One commenter supported an outright ban on the use of chlorophenolics for wood surface treatment.


Two commenters warned that listing F033 wastes would hinder remediation efforts at contaminated wood surface protection
sites. The Agency agrees with the commenters' point that a hazardous waste listing may provide a disincentive for
owner/operators of surface protection plants to initiate voluntary remediation efforts. The regulation of potentially
large amounts of contaminated soil as listed hazardous waste could delay the start of cleanup due to the administrative
and economic realities of regulatory compliance. 

Three commenters expressed concern over the possibly perceived interchangeability of the proposed 0.1 ppm concentration
level and the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) regulatory level for pentachlorophenol. Although the Agency is not finalizing
the F033 hazardous waste listing, EPA nevertheless wants to make clear that the concentration level proposed in the
F033 listing description was not intended as a regulatory level for any purpose other than defining a waste as F033.
The current regulatory level for pentachlorophenol that defines a waste as hazardous under the TC (100 mg/L) would
not have been affected by this rulemaking in any way had the F033 listing been promulgated today. Levels set for the
TC are obtained by running models which simulate acidic landfill conditions. For the proposed listing, the proposed
0.1 ppm level was calculated using a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 0.001 ppm and a risk analysis using the Agency's
Multi-med model. Multi-med simulates groundwater contamination from specific sources, and for this proposal,
it incorporated variables which are specific to sawmill conditions. The Agency's analysis approximated the dilution
of pentachlorophenate from the time the waste contacts the ground to when it reaches a ground water well. The Agency
did not arrive at the 0.1 ppm level by applying a dilution attenuation factor (DAF) of 100 (as the Agency has done in other
circumstances) to the MCL. Indeed, the Agency did not take a position in the proposal about the use of DAFs in calculating
acceptable risk levels for any constituents. A detailed discussion of the Agency's modeling assumptions and actual
parameters used to generate risk approximations can be found in the docket for the proposed rule. 

One commenter expressed reservations regarding the decontamination procedures promulgated previously for wood
preserving equipment (55 FR 50482-50483, December 6, 1990). The Agency is aware that equipment cleaning will
not always prevent cross-contamination. However, it will certainly reduce the amount of contamination that would
occur if no equipment cleaning took place. Although the Agency is not finalizing the proposed F033 hazardous waste
listing, EPA encourages owner/operators of surface protection plants to clean or replace any surface-treating
equipment that was used previously with chlorophenolic formulations upon a switch to non-chlorophenolic chemicals
and properly dispose of the wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Furthermore, the Agency has obtained information
which shows that some new substitute products are more effective if residual chlorophenolic contamination is removed.
Hence, removing sludge and cleaning equipment from previous chlorophenolic use will not only be more environmentally
sound, but may also enhance the new products effectiveness. Methodology on recommended cleaning and operating practices
for surface protectors will be published in the near future by the Agency in a pollution prevention and waste minimization
guidance document. 

One commenter suggested that the proposed operating standards for surface protection plants be codified in part
262 as opposed to parts 264/265. The commenter reasoned that most surface protection plants are only generators and
do not function as treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). However, since the F033 hazardous waste
listing is not being promulgated, this issue is moot and there is no need for special generator requirements. 

Several commenters had specific concerns about the applicability of the proposed F033 listing. Since the Agency
is not finalizing the proposed F033 listing, these concerns are also moot. However, where appropriate, answers specific
to each of these comments have been addressed in the background document of this final rule. 

One commenter questioned the representativeness of the Agency's data on cross-contamination. The commenter stated
that because sites were not randomly selected, there is no true sample representation of the surface protector population.
EPA did not choose sampling sites based on their statistical representativeness. Rather, the sites were selected
as appropriate from what the Agency considered to be typical operating plants. The Agency visited more than 15 surface
protection sites in the Nation (both large and small plants). From the information obtained from these plant tours
and interviews, the Agency developed a view of what it considered typical from an engineering standpoint (

e.g.

 size of equipment, production scale, presence of containment systems, size of storage yards, amount of drippage,
etc). The sites sampled need not represent the entire surface protection industry in terms of the process used and
the degree of cross-contamination present to allow the Agency to demonstrate that wastes from current and previous
use of chlorophenolics at surface protection sites were contaminated with the constituents of concern. These sites
were chosen from information obtained by a questionnaire sent out under the Agency's 3007 RCRA authority.

B. Comments Regarding Risk Assessment 



Five commenters responded to the risk assessment presented in the proposed rule. One commenter stated that the EPA
incorrectly converted units of measurement in the record sampling data used for the risk assessment causing the overestimation
of incremental risk for the fish/shellfish consumption and soil ingestion pathways by a 1,000-fold. The EPA agrees
with the commenter. The dioxin concentrations in the formulation at one of the affected facilities (Aquasco, MD)
were reported in the wrong units, causing a 1,000-fold error to be incorporated into the risk estimates for the fish
and shellfish ingestion and soil ingestion scenarios. When this error is corrected, the TCDD-TEQ dioxin levels used
as the source concentration (the concentration of formulation dripping onto the ground) for affected facilities
(cross-contamination from past use of chlorophenolic formulations) and used in the lifetime individual risk estimates
for the soil ingestion scenario and fish and shellfish ingestion scenario were reduced by a 1,000-fold. The lifetime
individual risk values using the corrected data are presented in Table 1. 






The estimated risk to any one individual using the corrected values are 1,000-fold lower than the risk estimated in
the proposed rule from cross-contamination due to past use. In this case for the typically exposed individual in the
general population, the incremental risk of developing cancer is a chance of 0.8 in a trillion (8E-13); in the
recreational fisher person, the risk of developing cancer is increased by only 2E-12. The estimated incremental
population risk is also reduced, after correction, approximately by a 1,000-fold, to 0.0002 cases/70 years for the
anticipated increase in the development of cancer as a result of exposure to ingestion of fish/shellfish contaminated
with wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection. Chart 1 in Section V Part A of
this final rule shows the original values reported in the April 27, 1993 proposed notice. 

The soil ingestion scenarios also were based on the storage yard soil concentrations. The soil ingestion scenario
assumed that children ages 1 to 6 could come into contact with the contaminated soil at the sawmill sites because sawmill
sites could be converted to rural residential land use and the child's play area could be located on the area previously
used as a storage yard area. The lifetime individual risks, using the corrected formulation concentration values
for dioxin, associated with the soil ingestion scenario for cross-contamination from past users of chlorophenolic
formulations are presented in Table 2.

<DOCNO> FR940104-0-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The estimates presented in Table 2 show that the incremental risks from direct soil ingestion by children are below
what the Agency considers a level of concern. A child exposed to storage yard soils cross-contaminated by past users
of chlorophenolics under typical conditions (consumption of 0.1 gram of soil/day for 160 days/year for six years)
would be subject to an increased cancer risk of 7E-10 over a lifetime, or a chance of 0.7 in a billion. The estimated
incremental population risk is also reduced approximately 1,000-fold (to 4E-7 cases per year over a 70-year
period) for the anticipated increase in the development of cancer as a result of exposure to direct ingestion of soil
contaminated with wastes from the use of cross-contaminated formulations for wood surface protection. 



One commenter remarked that the EPA failed to specifically address the incremental risks to subsistence fisher persons
from consumption of fish/shellfish contaminated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection.
EPA agrees that the risks to highly exposed sub-populations should be considered. The fish ingestion scenarios developed
for the proposed rule considered exposure to a general population and recreational fisher at the outflow of a drainage
area containing surface protection facilities. 

EPA used the analysis for the high end recreational fisher to approximate the risk to the subsistence fisher. Recent
data show that the high end ingestion rate for a subsistence fisher is greater than for a recreational fisher by a factor
of approximately 2. Therefore, the incremental risk for a subsistence fisher would not exceed a level of concern,
since the projected risk to recreational fishers is much less than 10

^6

. 


The analysis of risks from fish consumption assumes that all fish in the drainage basin are contaminated. The estimates
of PCDDs and PCDFs in fish tissue are based on sediment concentrations of these constituents. The sediment concentrations
are estimated based on the erosion of contaminated soils from sawmill sites in a river or stream basin and subsequent
dilution of contaminant levels by the erosion of uncontaminated soils from the corresponding drainage basin. 

The projected risk levels increase as the size of the drainage area decreases, due to the relatively lower amounts
of uncontaminated soil in smaller drainage basins. EPA performed an analysis which shows that, even with all exposure
parameters set at values which would maximize the overall estimate of exposure, in order to reach a risk level of 10

^6

, the drainage area would need to be 8,000 hectares or less, which is smaller than the smallest drainage area in the country.
The average drainage area is 440,000 hectares, and the lower fifth percentile of the size distribution is 109,000
hectares.

With regard to the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario, one commenter maintained that the fish/shellfish ingestion
scenario should have been performed on a site-specific basis (

i.e.

 EPA should have used parameters seen at individual sites), because not all sawmills are located on streams with commercial
fisheries. The EPA chose the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario to be protective of the recreational fisher persons
and the general population. The risk analysis was structured so that the hydrologic cataloguing unit (or watershed)
was the basic unit of analysis to ensure that the contaminated sediment would be associated with a body of water large
enough to support fish hatcheries and recreational fisher persons. When these assumptions were used in the fish/shellfish
ingestion scenario using corrected values for dioxin found in formulation for PCDDs and PCDFs, the incremental risk
to individuals with high-end exposures remains well below 1 x 10

^6

. 

With regard to the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), one commenter asserted that the equation is overly conservative
for estimating soil erosion from surface protection sites. This equation models the amount of soil which is dumped
into a drainage area containing fish. For a more detailed description of the model, the reader is referred to background
document of the proposed rule. The EPA believes that, although this may be a conservative approach, it is the best method
currently available. It has been used to support other EPA rulemakings and guidance documents. The most notable example
being the Assessment of Risks from Exposure of Humans, Terrestrial and Avian Wildlife, and Aquatic Life to Dioxins
and Furans, from Disposal and Use of Sludge from Bleached Kraft and Sulfite Pulp and Paper Mills.
 Even using these conservative assumptions, the incremental risks from cross- contamination at these sites are not
at a level of concern. 





One commenter suggested that the population risks attributable to the contaminated fish/shellfish ingestion scenario
were too high because the entire U.S. population was considered to be exposed. EPA disagrees and believes it is appropriate
to consider the consumption rate of the entire population in estimating risk to the general population from this exposure
pathway. However, an adjustment of 0.4 was made to the diet fraction to account for the fact that not all fish are contaminated.
Thus, only some percentage of the population would be affected by the contaminated fish. As discussed in the Risk Assessment
Background Document for the proposed rule, the 0.4 diet fraction was derived by estimating the percentage of rivers
and streams (i.e., cataloguing units) that have at least one sawmill. A second adjustment was made in the calculation
of population risk to account for the percentage of sawmills that operate surface protection processes (about 30%
of the entire number of sawmills nationally). Population risk for the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario has been
recalculated for the final rule using the corrected incremental storage yard soil TCDD-TEQ concentrations. The
corrected estimate of incremental population risk from cross-contamination is three orders of magnitude lower
than the risk originally stated in the proposed rule. The corrected number of cancer cases expected in 70 years is now
0.0002. 

One commenter asserted that the soil ingestion scenario was overly conservative because all of the soil consumption
was attributed to contaminated storage yard soil and no consumption of ``indoor dust'' was considered. EPA considered
only the consumption of storage yard soil in order to be protective of human health. The range of soil ingestion rates
for average children aged 1 through 6 is presented in the EPA's Exposure Factors Handbook (1990) as 0.2 to 0.8 grams
per day. These estimated values were determined from the clay content of fecal samples taken from children in this
age group and thus represent consumption of soil. However, the percent of this consumption that is attributed to house
dust is unknown, as is the contaminant concentration in the house dust. The EPA has recalculated the soil ingestion
scenario using the corrected incremental TCDD-TEQ concentrations obtained from the formulation sample. The incremental
risk estimated is below 1E-6, using the conservative assumptions. The Agency's risk levels are particularly
protective with the use of these conservative assumptions, thereby further lending support to the Agency's decision
not to list these wastes.

One commenter stated that children are unlikely to consume sediment at the same rate that they consume soil. The Agency
agrees, but notes that sediment consumption by children was not considered as an exposure pathway in the proposed
rule. The Agency does not feel that this exposure pathway is a significant one in making a determination whether or
not to list chlorophenolic wastes since the exposure areas of concern are relatively small and any land conversion
which could take place would most likely require soil testing prior to land development. 

One commenter stated that the assumptions used to estimate the exposed population in the soil ingestion population
risk scenario greatly overestimate the number of exposed children. EPA believes that the scenario may be conservative,
but not implausible. The scenario assumes that all sawmill sites are converted to rural residential land use, that
the children's play areas are located on the site of the former storage yards, and that the homes are resold to new families
with young children every 25 years. These assumptions include a low population density in these areas. It would take
only a limited number of sites to be converted to suburban housing or to daycare or school facilities to cause a substantial
increase in the exposed population. The incremental population risk estimated using the corrected incremental
value for the storage yard soil TCDD-TEQ concentration is 4E-7 cases in 70 years, three orders of magnitude lower
than that in the proposed rule. 

One commenter maintained that the soil ingestion scenario was questionable because Superfund liabilities, state
laws, and lender requirements make land use changes unlikely without site cleanup activities. The EPA agrees that,
in some states, land transfers and subsequent land use changes would be unlikely to occur without cleanup. However,
not all states are equally diligent in requiring site investigations at the time of property transfer, making the
types of land use changes described in the soil ingestion scenario plausible. Because of this, EPA believes it is entirely
appropriate to assess risk via the soil ingestion pathway, notwithstanding any risk management decisions that may
be made at some future time to address the risk. 

Two commenters believed that some of the values used as input parameters to the ground-water model (

i.e.

 recharge rate, regional conductivity, and average depth to water) were too conservative and that more appropriate
input parameters should be used in this MULTIMED model. One commenter believed that the Agency had used DRASTIC (a
name given to a modelling program used to evaluate the potential which may exist resulting from groundwater pollution)
to perform its groundwater modeling. First, the EPA did not use the DRASTIC model in this rulemaking effort; it used
the MULTIMED model developed by the Agency to perform groundwater models. The Agency did, however, use some soil and
hydrogeologic information (on hydrogeologic regions and subregions collected by Aller 

et al.

 (1988)) which is used when applying the DRASTIC model. With regard to the parameters felt by the commenter to be too
conservative, the EPA supports the values used in the proposed rule (58 FR at 25706 of April 27, 1993). This hydrogeologic
information includes many of the input parameters required to run the MULTIMED model, and includes such parameters
as depth to water, soil type and hydraulic conductivity, net recharge, aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The EPA selected
hydrogeologic subregions in the northwest and southeast United States, excluding subregions where sawmills were
not likely to be sited (

e.g.,

 mountain slopes or flanks). Since the parameter value ranges presented in Aller 

et al.

 (1988) are based on compilations of literature values and expert opinion, the values should be viewed as bounding
ranges, and are not sufficiently statistically rigorous to estimate true means or parameter distributions. For
the average case, ``typical'' parameter values were obtained by examining the ranges of values in Aller 

et al.

 (1988) for the selected subregions only and selecting values representing the central tendency of the reported ranges.
Similarly, high-end values were selected to represent the high end of the exposure distribution, using the higher
end of the range of parameter values deemed likely to occur by Aller 

et al.

 (1988). EPA recognizes that there are limitations to this approach, largely associated with the non-statistical
nature of the data. The Agency believes, however, that this data source is the best available at this time for regional
and subregional estimates of the hydrogeologic properties necessary to estimate exposures through the ground-water
pathway. 

Two commenters felt that the Agency's use of input parameter values used for well location and well intake point were
too conservative. EPA derived the horizontal distance to wells from the responses reported in the RCRA's 3007 Industry
Questionnaires. Because information was not obtained on the well type or construction, all wells described in the
questionnaire were assumed to be possible sources of drinking water and were assumed to be screened to the top of the
aquifer, that is, well water was assumed to be drawn off the top of the aquifer where organics are assumed to exist in
greater concentrations than when water is drawn from the middle of the aquifer. These assumptions are consistent
with similar conservative assumptions used to develop other RCRA regulations, such as the Toxicity Characteristic
(55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990). 

Two commenters contended that neither biodegradation or chemical degradation rates were considered in the ground-water
modeling of pentachlorophenol contamination. These commenters submitted studies showing that biological and
chemical degradation of PCP can occur and that adequate biological and chemical degradation rates are available
or can be estimated from these studies. EPA has reviewed these studies and agrees that they do indicate that biological
and chemical degradation of PCP can occur. The information submitted by the commenters are results from laboratory
studies, reporting the results from controlled experiments. However, EPA does not agree that there is sufficient
information on unassisted field degradation rates, the geochemical factors that affect degradation, or their spatial
variability from site-to-site or region-to-region to model degradation in the field at generic or prototypical
sites for regulatory purposes. Moreover, the existence of metabolites that would confirm the occurrence of biodegradation
in the field has not been firmly established. Therefore, EPA does not believe the data warrant an assumption that biodegradation
does occur at significant rates at most sites. In addition, the toxicities of potential degradation products have
not been characterized. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is appropriate to consider these mechanisms in this
rulemaking.

One commenter suggested that it would be more appropriate to calculate the average peak concentration of pentachlorophenate
in groundwater used to reflect a 9-year exposure duration by producing a breakthrough curve of annual concentrations
at a well using the MULTIMED model and calculate a series of 9-year or 10-year moving averages. The moving averages
would be sorted in descending order and a paper plot prepared. A preferred percentile value could then be selected
as the concentration of concern. EPA believes the current method of calculating 10-year time-weighted averages
by averaging two 5-year concentrations (including the maximum concentration and the highest adjacent 5-year value
calculated from each model run) is an appropriate approach for estimating lifetime individual risk and the Agency
selected this approach to be conservative and protective of human health. The 30-year exposure duration scenario
uses a time-weighted 30-year average concentration that includes the maximum concentration. Population risk estimates
aggregated over 70 years were based on a time-weighted 70-year average concentration that includes the maximum concentration.


One commenter believed that the source concentration used by EPA for PCP in the ground-water ingestion scenario was
too high because PCP is no longer in use and, thus, the infiltration to ground water would be reduced. The commenter
suggested that source reduction also would occur from erosion of surface soil containing PCP, before it is leached
and enters the ground water. EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk
estimates in the proposed rule, which have been revised in the final rule based on comments received to reflect source
concentrations and pulse durations (estimated time in which pentachlorophenate is expected to be present in substitute
wood surface protection product from time of changeover) more representative of the cross-contamination scenario.
While surface runoff and erosion may reduce the amount of PCP available for leaching to ground water, EPA has assumed,
for the purpose of its analysis, that any reductions are negligible. The EPA adopted this conservative assumption
mainly because of lack of data necessary to quantify such a loss and its effects on ground-water concentrations. Furthermore,
EPA does not believe that surface water and erosion will significantly reduce source leachate concentrations. As
formulation drips onto the soil it will rapidly penetrate the soil until the soil is saturated. Subsequent rain events
may wash off contaminated surface soil, but will not erode deeper soil horizons where most of the contaminant mass
resides. Thus, EPA does not consider this assumption to be overly conservative. 

One commenter noted that the results of the ground-water analysis were not supported by actual resource damage data.
The Agency does not expect, nor does it feel that it is needed, that ground water PCP concentrations predicted by MULTIMED
would agree precisely with the resource damage data. The resource damage incidents presented in the background document
are intended to illustrate that ground-water contamination from PCP does occur at sawmill facilities, and are not
intended as validation points for exposure modeling. Resource damage data were obtained from monitoring and other
wells that happened to be in place at a facility when the sampling was conducted. There are a number of possible reasons
why sampling data from the resource damage incidents may not reflect well-water concentrations predicted by the
model, in particular the location of the wells with regard to plume centerline and ground-water flow direction, and
the timing of peak plume concentrations at the wells. 

The latter point is especially important because, depending on patterns of past PCP use and the well location, the
peak concentration in the plume may not have reached or may have passed the well(s) sampled. In these resource damage
cases, sufficient information was not available to determine the placement and design of these wells with respect
to the site's hydrogeology or possible plume locations and travel time. Thus, it is not possible to use these data points
for validation of model results. However, it should be noted that the model-estimated ground-water PCP concentrations
in the final rule are similar to those reported from resource damage incidents. When the revised average source concentration
was used in the ground-water model, the estimated concentrations for PCP in ground water (average = 0 .005 mg/L; high-end
= 288 mg/L) are in a reasonable agreement with the values reported in the resource damage accounts (<0.001 to 45
mg/L). 

One commenter disagreed with the use of MULTIMED in that it was not as ``robust'' or well-tested as the Monte Carlo-based
EPACML model used for the TC rule. Another commenter recommends the use of the Monte Carlo approach for all input parameters
in the modeling effort. First, it is important to note that the MULTIMED ground-water model is the same model as used
in EPACML except for the manner in which input parameters are specified. EPACML can only be run in a probabilistic,
Monte Carlo mode, while MULTIMED allows Monte Carlo runs as well as for individual input parameters to be specified
and fixed. The ground-water flow and transport model components are the same for MULTIMED and EPACML. Second, the
Agency did not pursue a probabilistic, Monte Carlo-based approach when developing input parameters for this modeling
effort due to the fact that using this sophisticated technique requires knowledge and proper specification of input
parameter distributions, and variable independence or proper specification of joint probability parameter distributions.
When these requirements cannot be met, the Monte Carlo approach will not provide better estimates than a scenario-based
approach.

EPA has adopted a scenario-based regional modeling approach that uses input parameters developed for regions of
the U.S. where sawmills are more prevalent. In this approach, EPA uses average and high-end values for estimating
model input parameters on a regional basis because information does not exist on the actual means and distributions
of these parameters for the regions modeled. The Agency believes that this approach is an appropriate one and, furthermore,
that the resulting model estimates bracket or bound the uncertainty associated with the model input parameters.


Two commenters questioned the use of cancer as the endpoint of concern for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. EPA disagrees. The cancer
endpoint for TCDD was selected because it is the most sensitive endpoint for which qualitative dose response data
are available. 2,3,7,8-TCDD has been demonstrated to be a potent carcinogen in animals and has been classified as
a B2 (potential human) carcinogen. Recently published epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed individuals
report significant increases in cancer mortality. 2,3,7,8-TCDD also has potent reproductive and teratogenic endpoints
and enough data exist to estimate a reference dose (RfD) based on these alternative short-term effects. (For a detailed
discussion of this information, and for references to studies supporting these conclusions, the reader is referred
to the background document of the proposed rule.) However, if health-based levels (HBLs) are calculated using the
reproductive effect RfD, the exposure level is an order of magnitude higher than the level calculated using the carcinogen
slope factor (CSF). Thus, if the cancer end-point is used as the basis for calculating a permissible exposure level,
it also will be protective against short-term exposures such as those associated with reproductive effects. 

The issue of 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity is being reassessed by EPA (outside the framework of this rulemaking) and all endpoints
are being considered. TCDD has been observed to express a wide variety of effects including teratogenesis, reproductive
effects, and suppression of the immune system function in many species. Mechanistic approaches to understanding
and identifying toxic effects levels are also being considered. Until the reassessment process has been completed,
the EPA will continue to use the current carcinogenicity endpoint CSF value that has been accepted as the basis for
the MCL. 

Two commenters noted limitations associated with the use of the Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEF's) methodology.
They argued that the TEF methodology should not be used to justify the addition of appendix VIII in the absence of valid
toxicological studies that demonstrate actual health effects associated with exposure to these compounds. One
commenter questioned the proposal to add Octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and Octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF)
to 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. The commenters stated that neither compound has been shown to produce toxic, carcinogenic,
mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms. The Agency has decided not to add, at this time, OCDD
and OCDF to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. Although the original basis for including these congeners on appendix
VIII remains valid (details of which can be found in the background document supporting this final rulemaking), the
Agency is investigating further the information submitted by the commenters regarding the effects of OCDD and OCDF
reported in the Couture, Elwell, and Birnbaum study used to support the decisions made in the ``Interim Procedures
for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures of Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans
and the 1989 Update''. OCDD and OCDF are the most prevalent of the PCDD and PCDF congeners accounting for approximately
85 percent of the total CDD and CDF present in five of the six storage yard soil samples. OCDD has been shown to exhibit
``dioxin-like'' toxicity in male rats when administered in small doses in a sub-chronic toxicity study.
 These findings have been confirmed by a second sub-chronic study conducted in female rats.
 OCDD and OCDF have not exhibited toxicity in short term studies; however, acute exposure is not the only concern of
EPA. The Agency is currently re-evaluating its original assessment of risks from dioxin. At this point, the Agency
wishes to conclude its on-going reassessment before adding OCDD and OCDF to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. 






One commenter questioned the conclusion that soil contamination presents no risk to wildlife. The EPA recognizes
that concentrations that are protective of human health may not necessarily always be protective of wildlife. However,
in view of the relatively small areas occupied by sawmills and the low concentration of TCDD-TEQ in storage yard
soil from cross contamination, the EPA believes the incremental risks to wildlife will be below a level of concern.




V. Overview of the Final Rule 



This final rule makes final the Agency's hazardous waste listing determination for chlorophenolic wastes generated
at wood surface protection plants. EPA believes that listing as hazardous chlorophenolic wastes from surface protection
operations is unnecessary for reasons described in Part A of this preamble. 

This document also amends SW-846 (Test Methods For Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods) by
adding Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol). This action is discussed in Section
VI of this preamble. 

This final rule also adds four chemicals to the list of hazardous constituents at 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. These
four chemicals are: (1) Sodium pentachlorophenate, (2) potassium pentachlorophenate, (3) sodium tetrachlorophenate,
and (4) potassium tetrachlorophenate. A discussion of this action is found in part C of this section.

A. Basis for the Determination Not To List as Hazardous Wastes From Wood Surface Protection Operations 



As discussed in the proposed rule, in making a hazardous waste listing determination, the Agency applies a ``weight-of-evidence''
approach. In doing this, the Agency examines the risks associated with all potential human health and environmental
exposure pathways, analyzes trends in the current industry, researches past damage incidents, as well as other factors
found in 40 CFR 261.11. 

Upon reviewing and responding to comments received on the proposed rule, the Agency has decided not to list as hazardous
wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in the wood surface protection industry for several reasons.


First, chlorophenolic formulations are no longer being produced in the United States and the Agency believes it is
very unlikely they will be produced in the future. The only remaining producer of chlorophenolics in the U.S., Chapman
Chemicals, stopped production in January of 1992 and sometime later applied for voluntary cancellation of its FIFRA
product registration. A notice describing this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 3, 1992 (57 FR 23401), and a final cancellation order was sent to Chapman Chemicals with an effective date of
September 14, 1992. This cancellation notice applies to the following products produced by Chapman Chemicals: Permatox
181, 10S, and 101, and Mitrol G-ST. Any manufacturer wishing to resume production of chlorophenolics would have to
obtain a new FIFRA registration before these chemicals could be re-introduced and made available for use in wood surface
protection. Currently, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics in the U.S. out of an estimated 1000 previous
users and the remaining plant's existing stock is believed to be very limited. A major element in the decision not to
list as hazardous chlorophenolic wastes generated from the surface protection industry is the fact that use of chlorophenolic
formulations has ceased. EPA believes it is highly unlikely that a manufacturer will seek reregistration for this
product for many reasons, including the availability of effective substitute products and the potentially high
financial and administrative burdens imposed by the FIFRA registration process. Additional justification to support
non-future production is the fact that European countries do not want to accept dioxin-containing wood products
which have affected large export mills who will not use chlorophenolic formulations in the future in part for this
reason. Use of chlorophenolics for surface protection has declined steadily (even without the influence of RCRA)
from over 1,000 users to one user over the past decade. Should a new registration of this product be sought, EPA will
consider this surface protection risk analysis for full strength application when determining whether a new listing
determination under RCRA should be initiated. Currently, the Agency is aware of nine available substitute products
currently being used by surface protectors in place of chlorophenolics. The substitute products are for a large part
satisfactory to their users (as mentioned on various site trips), and the Agency does not feel as though a switch back
to chlorophenolics is likely. 

A second reason why the Agency has decided not to list these wastes is because the risk to human health and the environment
from on-going operations which previously used chlorophenolics is shown to tail off quickly because chlorophenolic
concentrations diminish to a near zero concentration within a short period of time following switchover to an alternate
product. The Agency has determined that the use of full-strength chlorophenolic formulations generates wastes
that result in unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. As before mentioned, should the use of chlorophenolics
for surface protection applications resume, for any reason, the Agency will most likely re-evaluate its current
position. However, dealing with the current situation, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics with
a limited supply remaining. 

Although the Agency believes the use of full-strength chlorophenolics will be phased out in the very near future,
there was concern at the time of proposal that there may be unacceptable risks posed by the use of substitute products
that become cross-contaminated from previous chlorophenolic use. Particularly, the proposal cited possible ground
water risks of 2 x 10

^4

 for individuals and a broad but very low potential exposure risk due to surface run-off contributing to dioxin levels
in fish. The Agency received several comments addressing these potential impacts. In response to these comments,
the Agency conducted additional ground-water modeling using new pulse assumptions developed from commenter-submitted
information. The Agency developed what it believed to be better pulse assumptions in an effort to determine how long
pentachlorophenate will be present in on-going operations which have switched over from its past use. This new data
was obtained from performing mass balance iterations using typical tank volumes found at both large and small facilities.
These mathematical calculations showed that cross-contamination from previous use of chlorophenolics will be
present in a substitute products for only two to six years from the time a plant stops using chlorophenolics. The Agency
found that the highest estimated risk to an individual from drinking ground water for nine years at peak concentrations
in the two- or six-year pulse resulting from cross contamination, is significantly diminished and the broad effect
on dioxin levels in fish is reduced by several orders of magnitude. This new analysis shows that the risks associated
with cross-contamination do not justify a hazardous waste listing to capture cross-contaminated wastes. In the
proposed rule, EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk estimates,
which have been revised in the final rule to reflect source concentrations and pulse durations more representative
of the cross-contamination, incremental-risk scenario. Chart 1 below compares the incremental risks from cross-contaminated
wastes as calculated for the proposed rule to the values obtained using the new approach.

As shown in Chart 1, population risk is lower than that presented in the proposal for both fish/shellfish consumption
and the soil ingestion pathway, due to a unit conversion error in expressing dioxin concentration. The dioxin concentrations
in the formulation at one of the affected facilities (Aquasco, MD) were reported using incorrect units, causing a
1,000-fold error to be incorporated into the risk estimates for the fish and shellfish ingestion and soil ingestion
scenarios. When this error was corrected, the TCDD-TEQ levels used as the source concentration for affected facilities
(cross-contamination from past use of chlorophenolic formulations) and used in the lifetime individual risk estimates
for the soil/fish and shellfish ingestion scenarios also were reduced 1,000-fold. 

The incremental population risk was revised for the ground-water scenario from an original 0.005 value to between
0.007 and 0.02 cancer cases. This range of 0.007 to 0.02 cancer cases was obtained because two different modelling
scenarios were run to generate the extremes of this range. One model run used input parameters which would simulate
decay for a small production plant. The input information was obtained from a mass balance iteration which showed
that it would take a small plant approximately 6 years to decrease cross-contamination levels to near zero; likewise,
the second model used input parameters for large facilities which predicted a two year decline to near zero levels
of cross-contamination. The details of the mass balance approach and the resulting change in population risk can
be found in the background document for this final rule. The Agency believes that these revised risk levels do not warrant
a hazardous waste listing. 

Based on the above two main factors (

i.e.

 (1) chlorophenolic production stoppage and subsequent chlorophenolic use decline and (2) revised risk due to cross
contamination), the Agency looked closely at any potential environmental benefits that may accrue from a hazardous
waste listing. Given the market trend, the Agency cannot identify any tangible benefits to be gained from listing
wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection. Environmental damages
caused by previous use of chlorophenolics have already occurred. A listing of these wastes cannot mitigate past damages
nor can it force the clean-up of these damages. Such potential jurisdiction exists under current programs. Authority
under CERCLA and RCRA 3007 exists even if a decision is made not to list as is the case for this final rule. 

Damage to the environment of this magnitude from previous use of chlorophenolic formulations within this industry
are not expected to occur in the future unless use of full-strength chlorophenolics resumes. Furthermore, sampling
data collected at surface protection sites indicate that dioxin concentrations in storage yards (the largest area
of a plant) are below 1 ppb. The heavier contamination that occurs in the process area is confined to a small area and
likely will not migrate off-site to environmental receptors. Therefore, the Agency finds that the risks posed by
this residual contamination are limited and that a hazardous waste listing would likely simply result in these limited
areas of contamination being left in place and not produce an environmental benefit. Thus the effect on past contamination
does not justify a hazardous waste listing. 



B. Operating Requirements for Surface Protection Plants 



Because the Agency is not listing F033 wastes, the operating standards for surface protection plants proposed in
the April 27, 1993 notice are not applicable and, thus, are not being finalized. Furthermore, surface protection
plants are not required to follow any specific waste management requirements regarding previous use of chlorophenolics
as a result of this rule. 



C. Addition of Chemicals to Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261 



Although this final rule does not list any wastes from wood surface protection processes as hazardous, the Agency
believes that certain constituents contained in these wastes warrant inclusion in appendix VIII of part 261. 40 CFR
261.11 provides that ``[s]ubstances will be listed on appendix VIII only if they have been shown in scientific studies
to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms.'' In the April 27 notice,
EPA proposed to add six hazardous constituents of concern found in surface protection wastes to appendix VIII of 40
CFR part 261. Based on the information gathered during this listing investigation, the following four are being added
to the list: sodium pentachlorophenate, potassium pentachlorophenate, the sodium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol,
and the potassium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol. The Agency presented information in the proposed rule and
supporting background documents on the adverse effects of these compounds. For those reasons, EPA is finalizing
the addition of four of these constituents to appendix VIII of part 261. The Agency is not at this time finalizing the
addition of OCDD and OCDF to Appendix VIII. As mentioned before, the Agency is investigating further the information
submitted by the commenters regarding the effects of OCDD and OCDF reported in the Couture, Elwell, and Birnbaum study
used to support the decisions made in the ``Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures of
Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans and the 1989 Update''.

VI. Amendment of SW-846 (Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods)



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency proposed to add Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of
Pentachlorophenate) to the Second and Third Editions of SW-846. The purpose behind this proposal was to aid
owners/operators of wood surface protection plants with the proposed formulation testing requirement.

With respect to requiring the use of SW-846 methods for testing for the presence of pentachlorophenate in wood
surface protection ``in-process'' formulation, the issue is moot since EPA is not listing any wood surface protection
wastes as hazardous. Nonetheless, EPA believes that although no comments were received on Method 4010, Method 4010
is an appropriate method, in general, for testing for the presence of pentachlorophenate or pentachlorophenol and
can, therefore, be used in other applications other than for wood surface protection formulation testing. The Agency
is, therefore, adding Method 4010 to the Third Edition of SW-846 as Update IIA. We are not adding Method 4010 to
the Second Edition of SW-846 since the Third Edition has replaced the Second Edition on August 31, 1993 for use
in mandatory applications (58 FR 46040). Method 4010, including its protocol and documentation supporting this
action can be found in the docket for this rulemaking. See the ``For Further Information'' Section in front of this
preamble for the EPA contact person for further information or with questions on Method 4010.



VII. Pollution Prevention and Waste Minimization



The Agency is preparing a separate guidance manual recommending voluntary pollution prevention and waste minimization
techniques for the lumber industry. Since it has studied the surface protection industry in making a listing determination
for wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations, EPA has gained a broad perspective on the best ways
to reduce wastes generated by this wood surface protection industry. The ideas gained from the study are presented
in this manual. Some recommended strategies for pollution prevention in the surface protection industry are described
in this section. Further information can be found in the manual.

The ultimate goal of pollution prevention is to reduce present and future threats to human health and the environment.
Pollution prevention (also referred to as source reduction) is the use of materials, processes, or practices that
reduce or eliminate the quantity and/or toxicity of wastes at the source of generation. Pollution prevention is the
first step in a hierarchy of options for reducing the generation of waste. The first recommended pollution prevention
option is to replace chemical treatment with another type of treatment to achieve surface protection. One alternate
is to dry the wood to reduce water content (high water content leads to sapstain). The Agency is aware that this option
may not be economically viable for a smaller mill. If such a system cannot be feasibly employed, it would be preferable
for a user of chlorophenolic-containing formulations to switch to an alternate formulation.

Other pollution prevention strategies for use within the surface protection industry include: (1) Providing local
and general ventilation within the cutting process area to reduce dust that can accumulate on wood; (2) blowing wood
with air to reduce the amount of sawdust on wood prior to surface protection; and (3) using drainage collection devices
like gutters on rooftops to keep precipitation away from process wastes. The pollution prevention practices described
here can be critical to reduce the amount of waste generated. Although the Agency is not listing these chlorophenolic
wood surface protection wastes, the pollution prevention practices described in the guidance manual are applicable
to any waste generating process. For wastes that cannot be reduced at the source, generators may consider recycling
as the next best option.

VIII. Analysis of Potential Costs and Benefits



A. Executive Order Requirements



Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Nevertheless, the Agency prepared an abbreviated RIA or ``Economic
Assessment'' (EA) in order to examine costs and benefits likely to occur as a result of that action.



B. Description of Costs and Benefits of This Rule



Because the Agency has decided not to list wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in surface
protection operations, no specific action is required under this Rule. Facilities, however, may choose to take some
remedial action as a result of publicity surrounding this action. A detailed analysis of work performed is described
in the background document for this final rule.



IX. State Authority



Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA
retains enforcement authority under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have
primary enforcement responsibility.

Before the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) amended RCRA, a State with final authorization administered
its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer
applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any plants located in the State with permitting
authorization. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated
to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized
State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.

By contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA
take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to
implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the
State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain
final authorization, the Federal HSWA requirements apply in authorized States in the interim.

Although this final rule does not list, as hazardous, chlorophenolic wastes from the wood surface protection industry,
it does add four constituents to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. These additions will not be effective in authorized
States since the requirements are not being imposed pursuant to HSWA. These requirements will be effective only in
those States that do not have final authorization. In authorized States, these requirements will not be applicable
until the States revise their programs to adopt equivalent requirements under State law.

Section 271.21(e)(2) of EPA's state authorization regulations (40 CFR part 271) requires that States with final
authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and submit the modifications to EPA
for approval. The deadline by which the States must modify their programs to adopt this proposed regulation, if it
is adopted as a final rule, will be determined by the date of promulgation of a final rule in accordance with   271.21(e)(2).
If the proposal is adopted as a final rule, Table 1 at 40 CFR 271.1 will be amended accordingly. Once EPA approves the
modification, the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements.

States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to what is being finalized in this rule.
These State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine
whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State would not be authorized to implement these regulations
as RCRA requirements until State program modifications are submitted to EPA and approved, pursuant to 40 CFR 271.21.
Of course, States with existing regulations that are not less stringent than current Federal regulations may continue
to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law.

It should be noted that authorized States are required to modify their programs only when EPA promulgates Federal
standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows
States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that
are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. (See
40 CFR 271.1(i).) This proposed rule, if finalized, is neither less stringent than nor a reduction in the scope of the
current Federal program and, therefore, states would be required to modify their programs to retain authorization
to implement and enforce these regulations.



X. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



This final rule amends the hazardous waste regulations by adding four chemicals to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261
and amending SW-846 by adding Method 4010. These are impacts with negligible effects to small entities. Therefore,
there is no need to consider its impacts on small entities by preparing a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.



XI. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

Federal Direct Student Loan Program 



<AGENCY>

 Department of Education.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final standards, criteria, and procedures. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education issues standards, criteria, and procedures governing the Federal Direct Student Loan
(Direct Loan) Program in the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. 



These standards, criteria, and procedures govern the Federal Direct Stafford Loans Program, the Federal Direct
Unsubsidized Stafford Loans Program, and the Federal Direct PLUS Program, collectively referred to as the Direct
Loan Program. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66).
Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government
rather than through private lenders. This program replaces the direct loan demonstration program that was authorized
to begin in July 1994 by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325). 



The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards,
criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual
procedures. The Secretary's representatives participated in regional meetings at various locations around the
country in which members of the higher education community including representatives of colleges, universities,
proprietary schools, and educational associations were consulted. The Secretary's representatives have also
met with numerous national, regional, and state organizations representing the financial aid community to discuss
various aspects of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary's representatives have met with personnel from schools
and financial advisors to assist in the development of the software that will be used by Direct Loan Program schools.
In addition, the notice is based in part on final regulations for the direct loan demonstration program in 34 CFR part
685 that were published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 2, 1993 (58 FR 36088), following the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking and consideration of public
comment. The Secretary believes that participating schools' familiarity with those regulations will ease the burden
of their participation in the Direct Loan Program.

This notice establishes the policies and procedures necessary for schools to implement the Direct Loan Program and
most of the policies and procedures relating to borrowers in the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary anticipates publishing
another notice in the spring of 1994 to govern repayment of loans for the 1994-1995 academic year and establish
standards and procedures relating to Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. 



I. Background 



On September 10, 1993, the Secretary published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47816) soliciting applications from schools for participation in the Direct Loan Program. Over 1,100 schools
responded to that invitation. The Secretary selected 104 schools, representing approximately five percent (5%)
of the total Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) loan volume, to participate in the Direct Loan Program for
the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. The rules in this notice are applicable for the period beginning July 1, 1994,
and ending June 30, 1995. As required by statute, program regulations for the Direct Loan Program in future years will
be developed through the use of a negotiated rulemaking process to the extent practicable. 



II. Participation 



Schools may participate in the Direct Loan Program by originating loans directly, by participating in a consortium
of schools that originates loans directly, or by using an alternative originator to originate loans. All schools
are responsible for determining student eligibility for Direct Loan and disbursing loan proceeds to borrowers.
Some schools participate in the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL concurrently, while the rest of the selected schools
participate exclusively in the Direct Loan Program. Some of the schools that participate in both programs concurrently
make Direct Loans available to first time borrowers only; other schools make Direct Loans available to students studying
in certain divisions of the school and make FFEL loans available to their other students. 

The standards and procedures in this notice are, unless otherwise noted, applicable to each participating school
regardless of its method or volume of participation. As stated in the notice announcing the selection of participating
schools for the 1994-95 academic year, a school may withdraw from participation within 30 days of the publication
of these standards, criteria, and procedures. 



III. Administrative Fee for Loan Origination 



Schools and consortia that originate loans will be paid a fee to assist in meeting the costs of loan origination, including
the costs associated with drawing down the funds, maintaining the Direct Loan Program account, and reconciling cash
and individual loan records with the Secretary each month. The Secretary prefers that originating schools print
promissory note/disclosure statements on site. To assist in compensating for the costs associated with this function,
schools that print promissory notes/disclosure statements will be paid a larger fee than schools that do not print
promissory note/disclosure statements. 

The administrative fee is paid for borrowers for whom a first disbursement has been made and for whom the first disbursement
has been reconciled with the Secretary. For the 1994-1995 academic year, the program-wide average administrative
fee may not exceed $10 per borrower. The Secretary will notify schools that originate loans of the actual fee schedule
and payment procedures when they are determined. 

This fee structure is applicable to the first year of the program only and is likely to be restructured through the negotiated
rulemaking process and when additional data are available. 



IV. Making Direct Loans 



Beginning with the 1994-95 academic year, all student applications for Federal student aid, including Direct
Loans, will be processed by the Central Processor System (CPS). The school will receive an official output from the
CPS in the form of a Student Aid Report (SAR) or an Electronic Student Aid Report (ESAR). The ESAR output may be on tapes,
cartridges, or rosters. With this official output, the school will be able to assemble a financial aid award package.
A school participating in the Direct Loan Program may package Direct Loans as part of the financial aid package in the
same manner that a school participating in the FFEL Program packages FFEL Program loans. 

A school in the Direct Loan Program will either originate loans or use the services for an alternative originator.
A school will use an alternative originator if it chooses not to originate loans or is not eligible to originate loans.
For the first year of the Direct Loan Program, the criteria for eligibility to originate were prescribed by statute.
These criteria were included in the September 10, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice. 



A. Originating Schools 



Under the Direct Loan Program, schools and consortia that originate loans must use software provided by the Secretary,
or other software based on specifications provided by the Secretary, to create a loan-origination record containing
the basic information necessary to make a loan. The software provided by the Secretary reformats the data received
from the CPS and prompts the school to add data collected by the school, such as the type of loan, loan amount, and disbursement
dates. Because schools have different needs, various options are available to schools after they generate the loan
origination record. The software allows schools to computer-generate combined promissory notes/disclosure statements.
Alternatively, a school could transmit the information collected by the school to the Direct Loan Program Servicer,
which upon request, will print promissory notes/disclosure statements on behalf of the school and ship them to the
school.

<TEXT>
 

A student who accepts a Direct Loan completes a promissory note and returns it to the school; the school may not disburse
Direct Loan funds without a completed promissory note. 

An originating school in the Direct Loan Program requests and obtains loan funds from the Secretary using a process
similar to the process for drawing down funds for other Department of Education (ED) programs. The Secretary adopted
this process to ease the burden on schools participating in the Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan Program system,
however, differs from the systems used for other ED programs in two ways. First, a school transmits to ED a specific
Direct Loan funding request that is separate from its funding requests for other programs. Direct Loan capital must
be tracked separately and cannot be used for purposes other than making Direct Loans. The actual transmission request
and subsequent electronic transfer of funds uses the same delivery process as is used for the Federal Pell Grant Program.
After a request for funds is received, the Secretary uses the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) process through the Federal
Reserve Banking system to deposit funds in a school's designated bank account. Currently, this process takes between
48 to 72 hours from the school's request for funds until the school's receipt of funds. 

The second difference between the Direct Loan Program system and the system used for other ED programs is that the amount
of loan capital needed by the school is dependent on the eligibility of student and parent borrowers at the school.
Funds for the Direct Loan Program are not limited by Congressional appropriations. As a result, there is no need for
a maximum funding level to be authorized for a school in the Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan system, however, incorporates
internal fund controls to monitor school drawdown requests; these controls will flag any requests that appear excessive.
The system also identifies schools that have failed to comply with program requirements. These flags result in immediate
inquiry and intervention by the Secretary. 

The software provided by the Secretary computes gross disbursements, loan fees, and net disbursements on the basis
of the loan amounts entered by the school. A school requests the amount needed to fund net disbursements to borrowers.
The Secretary expects that schools will follow the guidelines for cash management set out in The Blue Book, which is
the manual of accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for postsecondary educational institutions
under the federally-funded student financial aid programs. This notice requires any interest earned on funds drawn
down to be returned to the Secretary. For future years, the Secretary anticipates that issues related to fiscal control
and final accountability will be addressed in more detail in negotiated rulemaking. 

After receiving funds from the Secretary, a school disburses funds to students by crediting their accounts at the
school or by sending checks to the students. Before a school may disburse funds to a borrower, the school must ensure
that it has a completed and signed promissory note. After the first disbursement is made, the school must record the
actual disbursed amount and the date of each disbursement in the loan-origination record and transmit all completed
loan records and promissory notes to the Secretary. The school transmits subsequent disbursement data to the Secretary
as the disbursements occur. 

A school is required to reconcile cash and individual loan records monthly. To reconcile cash, a school must provide
documentation that the total disbursement minus cancellations, plus return of excess cash, is equal to the amount
of money the school has drawn down during a one-month period by the end of the next month. For example, loan records and
promissory notes for all disbursements and cancellations made in July 1994 must be transmitted to the Secretary by
the end of August 1994. To reconcile loan records, a school's records must match the records of the Direct Loan Program
Servicer. The software that is provided to participating schools is designed to assist schools in this reconciliation
process. 



B. Schools That Use an Alternative Originator 



Schools that use an alternative originator transmit to the Direct Loan Program Servicer the data necessary for the
Direct Loan Program Servicer to generate the combined promissory note/disclosure statement unless the school chooses
to print the promissory note/disclosure statement on its premises. After the Direct Loan Program Servicer generates
the promissory note/disclosure statement, it is sent to the school or to the borrower depending upon the school's
established procedures. The borrower must complete the promissory note/disclosure statement and forward it as
instructed to the Direct Loan Program Servicer or to the school. The Direct Loan Program Servicer must review the promissory
note/disclosure statement before funds can be disbursed. If the Direct Loan Program Servicer or the school determines
that the promissory note/disclosure statement is not accurate or complete, the promissory note/disclosure statement
must be correct and complete before funds can be disbursed. The Direct Loan Program Servicer initiates drawdown of
funds to the school based on the completed promissory note/disclosure statement. The school also receives a roster
from the Direct Loan Program Servicer identifying each borrower, the disbursement date and amount to be disbursed
for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Schools that use alternative origination
are still responsible for reporting actual disbursement data, reconciling cash, and returning funds that are not
used or for which the borrower is not eligible.

<PARENT> FR940104-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In short, the procedures used by a school that uses alternative origination differ in two ways from the procedures
of originating schools. The first is that a school under alternative origination may choose to designate the alternative
originator as the manager of promissory note/disclosure statements. The second is that a school under alternative
origination does not manage the funds draw down process; instead, the school receives funds drawn down by the alternative
originator only for those completed promissory notes in the possession of the alternative originator. 

The Secretary anticipates that issues related to participation of alternative originators in future years will
be subject to the negotiated rulemaking process. 



C. Federal Direct PLUS Loans 



Federal Direct PLUS loans are made through a process similar to the one used in the Federal PLUS loan program. The parent
obtains a combined application/promissory note from the school and, after completing the combined application/promissory
note, sends it to the school. The school completes the school section of the application/promissory note and forwards
it to the Direct Loan Program Servicer where data from the note is key entered and a credit check is performed. Alternatively,
a school enters data from the note using the software provided by the Direct Loan Program Servicer and electronically
forwards this information to the Direct Loan Program Servicer. In either case, the Direct Loan Program Servicer performs
a credit check to determine, as required by section 428B(a) of the HEA, whether the parent has an adverse credit history
and notifies the school and the parent of the results. If the loan is approved, the Direct Loan Program Servicer sends
a disclosure statement to the parent. If the credit check indicates an adverse credit history, the Secretary advises
the parent of available options; for example, the parent could obtain an endorser without an adverse credit history.
If the loan is approved and the school originates loans, the school may draw down money and disburse loan funds in the
same manner as it would for other loans made under the Direct Loan Program. If the school does not originate loans, the
alternative originator electronically transmits the funding request for the school based on the application/promissory
notes that the Direct Loan Program Servicer holds for that school. 



V. Loan Servicing 



The Secretary is responsible for servicing and collecting Direct Loans. As noted above, a notice specifically concerned
with repayment and collection will be published shortly. 

A school's interaction with the Direct Loan Program Servicer during the servicing and collection of the loan is similar
to the interaction schools currently have with lenders and guaranty agencies in the FFEL Program. Schools must respond
to periodic student status confirmation requests as well as to 

ad hoc

 requests for information regarding borrowers from the Direct Loan Program Servicer. 

Borrowers who default on Direct Loans are added to ED's debt collection system and are subject to all legally authorized
default-collection activities. 



VI. Impact of Other Rules 



Many of the provisions of the FFEL Program that are applicable to the Direct Loan Program have been incorporated into
this notice of standards, criteria, and procedures. The Secretary adopted those provisions because schools are
familiar with them from their participation in the FFEL Program. Certain policies and procedures currently being
developed through negotiated rulemaking for FFEL Program regulations will be adopted in the Direct Loan Program,
including policies relating to borrower forgiveness for students who attended schools that have closed or whose
eligibility was falsely certified and policies controlling the deferment for economic hardship. 



VII. Summary of Contents

B. Subpart B_Borrower Provisions 



Subpart B contains conditions of borrower eligibility, which are identical to the borrower eligibility provisions
in the FFEL Program. The charges for which borrowers are responsible, loan limits, deferment and forbearance options,
and borrower defenses to repayment are also included. The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 eliminated the Federal Supplemental
Loans for Students (SLS) program but increased the loan limits for the Unsubsidized Stafford Program beginning July
1, 1994. The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 further revised the loan limits. The revised loan limits
are included in this notice along with a chart (Appendix A) which illustrates the loan limits that will be applicable
as of July 1, 1994. 



C. Subpart C_Requirements, Standards, and Payments for Schools in the Direct Loan Program 



Subpart C contains those provisions governing a school's participation in the Direct Loan Program, including disbursement
procedures, entrance and exit counseling, withdrawal procedures, recordkeeping and funds control requirements.
The Secretary anticipates that schools will continue with the conscientious efforts demonstrated in the FFEL Program
in tailoring the counseling to the borrower's particular needs and making counseling accessible. These efforts
have included, for example, sign language interpreters for hearing impaired borrowers or translations for limited
English proficient borrowers. 



Executive Order 12866 



The contents of this notice have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order,
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the standards, criteria, and procedures in this notice.


The potential costs associated with the contents of this notice are those resulting from statutory requirements
and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these standards, criteria,
and procedures, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these standards, criteria, and procedures justify
the costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that the contents of this notice do not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

The contents of this notice are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities.




Waiver of Rulemaking 



It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.
However, Public Law 103-66 requires that the Secretary publish a notice in lieu of regulations for the first
year of the Direct Loan Program and exempts the contents of the notice from the rulemaking requirements of section
431 of the General Education Provisions Act. While the Secretary has consulted with members of the higher education
community in the development of this notice, the statutory timeframe for the program does not permit the solicitation
of further public comment. A public comment period, while helpful, would seriously delay the provision of necessary
guidance for the operation of the Direct Loan Program. Therefore, the Secretary finds that solicitation of public
comments would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).

The Federal Direct Student Loan Program.



(a) Under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the Secretary makes loans to enable a student
or parent to pay the costs of the student's attendance at postsecondary schools. This part governs the Federal Direct
Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, and the Federal Direct PLUS Program
for the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. The Secretary makes loans under the following program components:

students. The borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues during any period. 

(3) Federal Direct PLUS Program, which provides loans to parents of dependent students. The borrower is responsible
for the interest that accrues during any period. 

(b) The Secretary makes a Federal Direct Stafford Loan, a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, or a Federal
Direct PLUS loan only to a student or a parent of a student enrolled in a school that has been selected by the Secretary

an academic workload that amounts to at least one-half the workload of a full-time student, as determined by the school,
and is not a full-time student. A student enrolled solely in an eligible program of study by correspondence as defined
in 34 CFR 668.8 is considered a half-time student. 



Interest rate

process for drawing down funds for other federal student aid programs. 



Period of enrollment

: The period for which a Federal Direct Stafford, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford, or Federal Direct PLUS loan
is intended. The period of enrollment must coincide with a bona fide academic term (

is paid-in-full, exclusive of any period of deferment or forbearance. 



Satisfactory repayment arrangement

. The making of six consecutive voluntary on-time full monthly payments on a defaulted loan to regain further eligibility
for Direct Loan Program loans. The required monthly payment amount may not be more than is reasonable and affordable
based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. On-time means a payment made within fifteen days of the scheduled
due date and voluntary payments are those payments made directly by the borrower, regardless of whether there is a
judgment against the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by income tax offset, garnishment, or income
or asset execution.

 685.203 Loan limits. 



(a) 

Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program

. (1) In the case of a dependent undergraduate student who has not successfully completed the first year of a program
of undergraduate education, the total amount the student may borrow for any academic year of study under the Federal
Direct Stafford Loan Program, and the Federal Stafford Loan Program, may not exceed_

(i) $2,625 for a program of study of at least a full academic year in length; 

(ii) $1,750 for a program of study of at least two-thirds but less than a full academic year in length; and 

(iii) $875 for a program of study of at least one-third but less than two-thirds of an academic year in length. 

(2) In the case of a dependent undergraduate student who has successfully completed the first year of an undergraduate
program but has not successfully completed the second year of an undergraduate program, the total amount the student
may borrow for any academic year of study under the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program, and the Federal Stafford
Loan Program, may not exceed_

(i) $3,500 for a program of study of at least a full academic year in length; or 

(ii) If the student is enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, a prorated amount
that bears the same ratio to $3,500 as the remainder of the program measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock
hours bears to one academic year. 

(3) In the case of a dependent undergraduate student who has successfully completed the first and second year of a program
of study of undergraduate education but has not successfully completed the remainder of the program, or in the case
of a student in a program who has an associate or baccalaureate degree which is required for admission into the program,
the total amount the student may borrow for any academic year of study under the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program,
and the Federal Stafford Loan Program, may not exceed_

(i) $5,500 for a program of study of at least an academic year in length; 

(ii) If the student is enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, a prorated amount
that bears the same ratio to $5,500 as the remainder of the program measured in semester, trimester, quarter, or clock
hours bears to one academic year. 

(4) In the case of a graduate or professional student, the total amount the student may borrow for any academic year
of study under the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program, in combination with any amount borrowed under the Federal

Additional eligibility under the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program

. In addition to any amount borrowed under paragraph (b), an independent undergraduate student, graduate or professional
student, or certain dependent undergraduate students may borrow additional amounts under the Federal Direct Unsubsidized
Loan Program. In order for a dependent undergraduate student to receive this additional loan amount, the financial
aid administrator must determine and document in the school's file, after review of the family financial information
provided by the student and consideration of the student's debt burden, that the student's parents likely will be
precluded by exceptional circumstances (e.g., the student's parent receives only public assistance or disability
benefits, is incarcerated, has an adverse credit history, or his or her whereabouts are unknown) from borrowing under
the Federal Direct PLUS Program or the Federal PLUS Program and the student's family is otherwise unable to provide
the student's expected family contribution. A parent's refusal to borrow a Federal PLUS loan or Federal Direct PLUS
loan does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. The additional amount that such a student may borrow under
the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, in combination with Federal Unsubsidized Stafford loans,

has not completed the remainder of the program of study, may not exceed_

(i) $5,000 for enrollment in a program of study of at least a full academic year; 

(ii) If the student is enrolled in a program of study with less than a full academic year remaining, a prorated amount

hours bears to one academic year. 

(3) In the case of a graduate or professional student, may not exceed $10,000.

behalf a loan has been made under this part for the purpose of reporting to the Secretary the date that the student has
withdrawn from the school and for determining when a refund must be paid under  685.305. 

(b) 

The withdrawal date

. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the student's withdrawal date is the earlier
of_

(i) The date the student notifies the school of the student's withdrawal or the date of withdrawal specified by the
student, whichever is later; or 

(ii) The date of withdrawal as determined by the school. The school must determine the student's date of withdrawal
no later than_

(A) Forty-five days after the expiration date of the academic term in which the student was enrolled for a school that
uses academic terms (e.g., semester, trimester, or quarter), except that 30 days after the first day of the next scheduled
term may be used in the case of a summer break; or 

(B) Twenty-five days after a student's last date of attendance for a school that measures academic progress either
in clock hours or credit hours but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system.

this section, the student's withdrawal date is the first day of the leave of absence. 

(3) If the student is enrolled in a program of study by correspondence, the student's withdrawal date is the date of
the last lesson submitted if the student fails to submit the next scheduled lesson in accordance with the schedule
of lessons established under  685.302. However, if the student establishes in writing, within 60 days of the
date of the last lesson submitted, a desire to continue in the program and an understanding that the required lessons
must be submitted on time, the school may restore that student to in-school status for purposes of the loan made under
this part. The school may not grant the student more than one restoration to in-school status on this basis. 

(4) For the purpose of a school's reporting to the Secretary, a student's withdrawal date is the month, day, and year
of the withdrawal date determined under paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(3) of this section. 

(c) 

Leaves of absence

. A student who has been absent from school and has been granted a leave of absence by a school in accordance with this
paragraph is not considered to have withdrawn from school for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. In any 12-month
period, a school may grant no more than a single leave of absence to a student, provided that_

 685.307

Remedial actions. 



(a) 

General. 

The Secretary requires a school to purchase that portion of a Direct Loan that is unenforceable, or that the borrower
was ineligible to receive. The Secretary requires the repayment of funds and the purchase of loans if the Secretary
determines that the unenforceability of a loan or loans, or the disbursement of loan amounts for which the borrower
was ineligible resulted in whole or in part from_

(1) The school's violation of a Federal statute or regulation; or 

(2) The school's negligent or willful false certification. 

(b) In requiring a school to repay funds to the Secretary or to purchase loans from the Secretary in connection with
an audit or program review, the Secretary follows the procedures described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart H. 

(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may waive the right to require repayment of funds
or purchasing of loans by a school if, in the Secretary's judgment, the best interest of the United States so requires.


(d) The Secretary may impose a fine or take an emergency action against a school or limit, suspend, or terminate a school's
participation in the Direct Loan Program in accordance with 34 CFR part 668, subpart G. 

(e) The Secretary may take any other action necessary to enforce the Secretary's rights under the agreement specified
in  685.300.

Loans for Demand Side Management, Energy Conservation Programs, and On-Grid and Off-Grid Renewable Energy Systems


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Rural Electrification Administration, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule with request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) hereby amends its pre-loan regulations for electric loans to incorporate
changes to electric loan policies required by the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993 (RELRA).
This action will permit REA to make loans for demand side management (DSM), energy conservation programs, and on-
and off-grid renewable energy systems.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This regulatory action is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. The
Administrator of REA has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) does not apply to this rule. The Administrator of REA has determined that this rule will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Section 1710.117 requires
borrowers to comply with applicable environmental regulations and will cover the activities for which assistance
is sought under this subpart. This rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation,
which may require consultation with State and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule titled Department Programs
and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from
coverage under this Order. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule:
(1) Will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict
with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; (3) will not require administrative proceedings before
any parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. The program described by this rule is listed in the
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.850 Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees.
This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325. The existing recordkeeping and reporting burdens contained
in this rule were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
(44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), under control numbers 0572-0017, 0572-0032 and 0572-0103. Because of the deadline imposed by
the law, the additional recordkeeping and reporting burdens have been submitted to OMB for approval on an emergency
basis. Send questions or comments regarding these burdens or any other aspect of these collections of information,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. Attention: Desk Officer for USDA.


Background


The Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993, Public Law 103-129, 107 Stat. 1356, (RELRA), signed
into law by President Clinton on November 1, 1993, amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq. 

(RE Act). The amendments mandate a restructuring of the electric loan programs of REA. Loan purposes, the definition
of ``rural area'', applicable interest rates and loan terms and conditions were among the areas affected by RELRA.
An interim rule implementing these provisions of RELRA were published on December 20, 1993 at 58 FR 66260.
The amendments to 7 CFR part 1710, published today implement the provision for making loans for demand side management,
energy conservation programs, on- and off-grid renewable energy systems. This provision has a statutory deadline
of January 1, 1994.

Demand side management has become increasingly important to electric utilities as they seek ways to make their existing
systems more efficient and reduce the need for new capacity. REA has supported demand side management (DSM) activities
in the form of direct load control and energy conservation through loans for control equipment and principal deferment
programs for energy conservation. With the passage of RELRA, REA is authorized to expand its role and make loans for
all types of demand side management activities.

This authority will be used primarily to finance distribution borrower needs. REA believes that most DSM activities
must be conducted at the distribution level because DSM impacts the consumer's use of electricity. Power supply borrowers
are eligible for this financing assistance, but the level of investment required to support their distribution members
in this area is not normally expected to require loan funds. REA will not make DSM loans or any type of loans directly
to individuals.

To be eligible for a loan for DSM programs, which include energy conservation programs (except those financed by loan
principal deferments), and for on-grid renewable energy systems, the loan request must be supported by an REA-approved
integrated resource plan (IRP). REA may also require an IRP, on a case by case basis, for certain large or unusual loans
for off-grid renewable energy systems. DSM programs must also be supported by DSM plan, which must be consistent with
the borrower's IRP.

As defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486) (EP Act), an integrated resource plan is ``a planning
and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including new generation
capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating and cooling
applications, and renewable energy sources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service at the lowest system
cost. The process shall take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability,
dispatchability, and other factors of risk and shall take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved
through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; and
shall treat demand and supply side resources on a consistent and integrated basis.''

In the regulatory text, the term ``IRP'' is used to refer to the result of the process rather than the process.

The EP Act also defines the term ``system cost'' to mean ``all direct and quantifiable net costs for an energy resource
over its available life, including the cost of production, distribution, transportation, utilization, waste management,
and environmental compliance.''

This subpart establishes policies and requirements for IRPs and DSM plans. Many of these requirements are new, although
existing   1710.253 and 1710.254, and existing subparts E and G, set forth analytical and related requirements
for the financing of most generation facilities that are the same in many respects to the requirements of an IRP. Given
the expansion of REA lending authority in the relatively new and sometimes uncertain areas of DSM and renewable energy
systems, it is essential that borrowers make their investment decisions based on an IRP in order to ensure informed
and prudent investment planning.

If a distribution borrower is a member of a power supply borrower, its requests for DSM loans must be based on and be consistent
with the IRP of the power supply borrower. The IRP of the power supply borrower will establish which DSM programs, on-grid
renewable energy systems, and traditional utility investments, among several feasible alternatives, are most
cost-beneficial from the standpoint of the power supply borrower and its members taken as an integrated system. The
DSM programs of the individual distribution members must be coordinated among all parties to ensure that the DSM programs
of one member do not jeopardize the financial integrity and loan security of any other member or that of the power supply
borrower.

Although DSM must be implemented at the distribution level, a significant portion of the benefits and costs of DSM
are accrued at the power supply level. These benefits and costs are then transferred to the distribution borrower
through wholesale rates. Consequently, DSM planning by distribution borrowers must consider the impacts of their
activities on their power supplier and the implications of the power supplier's wholesale rates.

Because of the relationship between a power supply borrower and its members and the relationship among the members
of a power supply borrower, it is imperative that the power supply borrower and its members coordinate IRP activities
per  1710.356(b)(1) of this interim rule.

If a distribution borrower is not a member of a power supply borrower, loan requests for DSM programs and on-grid renewable
energy systems must be supported by the borrower's own IRP. The IRP must address, in particular, any effects its DSM
programs will have on the wholesale power rates charged by its non-REA financed power supplier.

The requirements set forth for DSM plans and IRPs are intended to provide guidance as these new requirements are implemented.
Since these areas are new in many respects, REA intends to exercise its discretion to administer the specific requirements
and procedures with a prudent degree of flexibility, especially during the first several months of implementation.
Comments from the public are invited regarding the policies and requirements set forth herein for DSM plans and IRPs.

This rule includes citations to studies of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of
Energy which are included as reader aids and do not imply REA adoption or endorsement of said studies.

This interim regulation will define DSM and renewable energy systems. It will also emphasize REA commitment to finance
nontraditional (renewables, DSM and energy conservation systems) and traditional resources on an equal footing.
Borrowers requesting loans under this subpart will be required to submit an IRP and a DSM plan in most cases.

Loans under this subsection for facilities to be owned and operated by the borrower will generally be treated like
loans for usual electric facilities. Loans for other purposes will be considered as operational loans with terms
based on the borrower's program cycle.

Until REA has developed experience in making loans for these new purposes, cumulative loans for DSM and for energy
conservation programs will be limited to an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the borrower's equity.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, REA amends chapter XVII, title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:


PART 1710_GENERAL AND PRE-LOAN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES COMMON TO INSURED AND GUARANTEED ELECTRIC LOANS


1. The authority citation for part 1710 is revised to read as follows:





Authority: 

7 U.S.C. 901-950(b); Pub. L. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341; Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of Agriculture,
7 CFR 2.23; Delegation of Authority by the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development, 7 CFR 2.72.



2. Section 1710.2(a) is amended by adding new definitions in alphabetical order to read as follows:


 1710.2

Definitions and rules of construction.


(a) * * *


Demand side management

 (DSM) means the deliberate planning and/or implementation of activities to influence consumer use of electricity
provided by a distribution borrower to produce beneficial modifications to the system load profile. Beneficial
modifications to the system load profile ordinarily improve load factor or otherwise help in utilizing electric
system resources to best advantage consistent with acceptable standards of service and lowest system cost. Load
profile modifications are characterized as peak clipping, valley filling, load shifting, strategic conservation,
strategic load growth, and flexible load profile. (See, for example, publications of the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), 3412 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, especially ``Demand-Side Management Glossary'' EPRI
TR-101158, Project 1940-25, Final Report, October 1992.) DSM includes energy conservation programs.
It does not include sources of electrical energy such as renewable energy systems, fuel cells, or traditionally fueled
generation, such as fossil or nuclear fueled generators.


* * * * *




DSM activities 

means activities of the type referred to in  1710.354(f).


DSM plan

 means a plan that describes the implementation at the distribution level of the DSM activities identified in the integrated
resource plan as having positive net benefits. See  1710.357.


* * * * *





Integrated Resources Plan (IRP)

 means a plan resulting from the planning and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the benefits
and costs of the full range of alternatives, including new generating capacity, power purchases, DSM programs, system
operating efficiency, and renewable energy systems.


* * * * *





Off-grid renewable energy system

 means an energy source which is not electrically attached to the grid. Off-grid systems are operated as an island and
will have no direct impact on a utility system's physical operations. An off-grid system need not meet electric utility
power quality standards.


On-grid renewable energy system 

means an energy source electrically attached to an existing grid. It can be attached on either side of a consumer's
meter. On-grid systems are operated as part of the overall utility system and have a direct impact on a utility system's
operations. An on-grid system must meet electric utility power quality and safety standards.


* * * * *





Renewable energy system

 means a source of energy (kWh) used to meet borrower electric load that is fueled by any of the following technologies:
Hydropower, geothermal, biomass, municipal waste, solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, fuel cells not fueled by
fossil fuels. See, for example, ``Renewable Resources in U.S. Electricity Supply,'' February 1993, Publication
number DOE/EIA 0561, published by the Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Forrestal Building,
EI-231, Washington, DC 20585.

This subpart sets forth REA policies and procedures with regard to loans and loan guarantees to REA borrowers for the
purpose of implementing their demand side management (DSM) plans, energy conservation programs, and on-grid and
off-grid renewable energy systems. The Administrator reserves the right to determine if loans for purposes under
this subpart will be made to a borrower in default under its mortgage and loan contract. As is the case with all other
REA loans, loans for purposes under this subpart will not be made to individuals. 


 1710.351 

General policy; renewable energy systems.


(a) Off-grid renewable energy systems will be considered the same as DSM activities and will qualify for either insured
loans or loan guarantees pursuant to  1710.102.
(b) On-grid renewable energy systems will be treated as a generation resource and will be eligible only for loan guarantees
pursuant to  1710.102. Existing REA policy with respect to generation resources shall generally apply.
(c) REA loans for renewable energy systems will be made only for systems utilizing technologies that are proven and
commercially available. 


 1710.352 

General policy; energy resource conservation programs. 


This subpart does not replace the energy resource conservation program financed by deferments of loan principal.



 1710.353 

General policy; demand side management.


(a) REA will make loans for the purpose of assisting electric borrowers to implement REA approved demand side management
plans. For the purposes of this regulation energy conservation programs are included as a DSM activity. 
(b) REA will treat demand-side and supply-side resources on an equal basis. All requirements applicable to loans
for traditional electric facilities will apply to loans for DSM. In addition the requirements set forth in this subpart
will apply.
(c) DSM will be considered a distribution loan purpose, eligible for either insured loans or loan guarantees pursuant
to  1710.102.
(d) REA will conduct its own evaluation, as specified in this subpart, of a borrower's DSM activities before making
a determination on the disposition of a borrower's loan application. 
(e) REA loans for DSM activities will be made only for systems utilizing technologies that are proven and commercially
available. 
(f) In general, REA will require pilot project testing of DSM activities new to the borrower. 
(g) If the borrower's IRP, DSM plan, project construction and/or financing, and/or rate recovery is subject to the
approval of state authorities, the borrower must obtain such approvals before REA will approve a loan for any purpose
for which an REA approved DSM plan or IRP is required under this subpart.
