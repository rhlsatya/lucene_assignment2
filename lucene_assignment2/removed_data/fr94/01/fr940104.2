<DOCTITLE>White Sand Ecosystem Management Project; Clearwater National Forest, Idaho County, ID</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of vegetation retention, vegetation treatments, access management, and fish habitat enhancement in the vicinity
of White Sand Creek, Beaver Creek, Savage Creek, Rabbit Creek, and Colt Creek drainages. The area is located south
and east of the Powell Ranger Station, Powell Ranger District, Clearwater National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho.
Most of the proposed project's activities are within the North Fork Spruce - White Sand (

#

1309) and Sneakfoot Meadows (

#

1314) Roadless Areas. The proposal's actions are being considered together because they represent either connected
or cumulative actions as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25).


The purposes of the project are to implement the Clearwater Forest Plan within the context of Ecosystem Management
principles; conserve biological diversity; retain the undeveloped character of White Sand scenery; restore ecosystem
function in fire-dependant forest communities; reduce the risk of large fires and improve opportunities for use
of prescribed natural fire; create vistas and visually rehabilitate several existing harvest unit boundaries;
produce wood products and increase timber growth and yield in a way that provides long-term sustainability of both
wood products and other ecosystem elements; protect water quality, fish populations, wildlife, and roadless characteristics
influenced by access; improve safety of roads for current public use and expected increases and changes in use; enhance
trail-based recreation; and manage limiting factors that affect fish populations in White Sand streams.
This project-level EIS will tier to the Clearwater National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan)
and Final EIS (September, 1987), which provides overall guidance of all land management activities on the Clearwater
National Forest.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed action is based on the findings of the White Sand Integrated Resource and Ecosystem Analysis (IRA). The
White Sand IRA is the first analysis on the Powell Ranger District using policy direction and emerging concepts of
Ecosystem Management (EM). The overriding purpose of EM policy is to better blend the needs of people and environmental
values so that National Forests represent diverse, healthy, productive, and sustainable ecosystems.


The planning area consists of approximately 40,000 acres of National Forest land located in sections 33-36
of T.37N., R.14E.; sections 13-15, 20-24 and 26-35 of T.37N., R.15E.; sections 1-3, 10-16
and 22-27 of T.36N., R.14E.; sections 1-11, 13-14 and 25-36 of T.36N., R.15E.; sections 1,
2, 11 and 12 of T.35N., R.14E.; sections 2-9, 17 and 18 of T.35N. and R.15E.; Boise Meridian.
The proposed action was designed to meet various ecological and social needs expressed in the White Sand IRA. Proposed
action activities fall into four broad categories: vegetation retention, vegetation treatments, access management,
and fish habitat enhancement. The purpose of the proposed action is to:


Vegetation Retention


_Conserve biological diversity
_Retain the undeveloped character of White Sand scenery


Vegetation Treatments


_Restore ecosystem function in fire-dependant forest types
_Reduce the risk of large fires in White Sand landscape and improve opportunities for use of prescribed natural fire
_Create vistas and visually rehabilitate several existing harvest unit boundaries
_Implement the Clearwater Forest Plan within the context of Ecosystem Management
_Produce wood products and increase timber growth and yield in a way that provides long-term sustainability of both
wood products and other ecosystem elements


Access Management


_Protect water quality, fish populations, and roadless characteristics influenced by access
_Improve safety of roads for current public use and expected increases or changes in use
_Enhance trail-based recreation


Fish habitat Enhancement


_manage limiting factors that affect fish populations in White Sand streams



The proposed action would accomplish the following activities over the next ten years:


Vegetation Retention and Treatments


_1,314 acres of underburning in fire-dependant vegetation communities, 59 acres of planting understocked seedling
stands, 14 acres of precommercial thinning overstocked sapling stands, create one vista area for picnicking and
viewing scenery, implement the following prescriptions for managing the forest: 704 acres of uneven-aged regeneration
harvest, 1313 acres of even-aged regeneration harvest, 55 acres of commercial thinning, and 50 acres of uneven-aged
regeneration harvest with underburning. These prescriptions would result in harvest of about 14,418 thousand board
feet (MBF) of timber

<DOCNO> FR940104-2-00004 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-2-00002 </PARENT>

Access Management


_2.7 miles of temporary road construction to provide access for harvesting, 6.0 miles of permanent road construction
to provide access for harvesting, 10.7 miles of road reconstruction to improve safety, re-align the junction of roads
360 and 359 to improve safety, create 3 temporary helicopter landings for harvesting, manage road access by closing
all new roads with gates or earthen barriers after completion of management activities, 5.7 miles of new trail construction,
and 13.6 miles of existing trail reconstruction


Fish Habitat Enhancement


_5.4 miles of fish habitat improvement by increasing active debris, developing pools, and modifying debris dams
and passage barriers



Possible Forest Plan amendments or site-specific adjustments may be needed to implement the proposed action. For
example, the Powell District will need to seek approval to exceed the 40 acre opening limitation, to create openings
within the historic range of variation and minimize fragmentation of large blocks of old growth. Openings larger
than 40 acres would retain remnants of the original tree cover to provide structural diversity within those stands.
Possible Forest Plan amendments include:



_Management area allocation changes for the Wild and Scenic River Corridor, to be determined through the concurrent
Wild and Scenic River Suitability Study for White Sand Creek
_Change the Forest Plan standard for Beaver Creek from A channel to B channel standards
_Change the Forest Plan standard for Crab Creek from Steelhead to Cutthroat
_Propose a Visual Travel Corridor for Elk Summit Road
_Propose several Visual Travel Corridors including parts of Beaver Ridge Trail 47 and roads 369, 368, 111, 362, 360,
and 359




The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the White Sand Planning Area to achieve the purpose and
need.

The Clearwater Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The area of proposed timber harvest
and reforestation would occur within Management Areas C8S, E1, E3, A4, and M2. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable
timber land, except where needed to facilitate ecosystem burning. These areas would be harvested only to manage fuel
conditions to prevent crown fires during reintroduction of fire to fire-dependant ecosystems. Ecosystem burning
would occur within management area C6, Key Fishery Habitat. Below is a brief description of the applicable management
direction.

Management Area E1_Timber Management_Provide optimum, sustained production of timber products in a cost effective
manner while protecting soil and water quality. 

Management Area E3_Aerial Harvesting Systems/Timber Management_Similar to management area E1, except long-span
cable, multi-span cable, or helicopter harvest systems will be utilized to limit road development.

Management Area C8S_Big Game Summer Range/Timber Management_Maintain high quality wildlife and fishery objectives
while producing timber.

Management Area A4_Visual Travel Corridor_Maintain or enhance an aesthetically pleasing, natural appearing forest
setting surrounding designated roads, trails, and other areas considered important for recreational travel and
use.

Management Area M2_Riparian Lands_Meet watershed and riparian dependant resource objectives and compatible timber
production.

Management Area C6_Key Fishery Habitat_Soil and water will be protected in these lands encompassing or adjacent
to high value fishery streams. Considered key summer range for elk and moose. This area is designated unsuitable for
timber production.

The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives to the proposed action. One of these will be the ``no action''
alternative, in which none of the proposed activities would be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine
varying levels and locations for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond
to the issues and other resource values.

The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and projected activities on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis
of site-specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness.

Public participation is an important part of the project, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7),
which starts with publication of this notice and continues for the next 45 days. In addition, the public is encouraged
to visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service
will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, the Nez Perce Tribe,
and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. Public meetings
will be scheduled between now and publishing of the Draft EIS. Interested individuals and organizations are encouraged
to contact the Powell District Ranger to be added to the project mailing list to receive future newsletters related
to this project and notification of public meetings.

Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be
used to:

1. Identify potential issues.

2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth.

3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as
the Clearwater Forest Plan EIS.

4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action.

5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects).

6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.

Some public comments have already been received in conjunction with the White Sand IRA. Preliminary issues identified
so far have been grouped into seven major categories: Biological Diversity and Ecosystem Management; Recreation,
Wilderness, and Roadless Areas; Water Resources and Fisheries; Wildlife; Social and Economic; Heritage Resources;
and Scenery. Issues commonly associated with effects of timber harvesting and road construction are grouped into
these seven categories. The complete list is available upon request from the Powell District Ranger. This list may
be verified, expanded, or modified based on public scoping for this proposal.

The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in September of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the 

Federal Register.

 The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register.

 It is very important that those interested in management of the White Sand area participate at that time. To be most
helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as site-specific as possible. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed
by February, 1995.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day scoping comment period so that substantive comments
and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in developing issues and alternatives.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues on the proposed action, comments should be as specific
as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the
procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

<DOCTITLE>Murphy Timber Sales and Associated Activities; Kootenai National Forest, Lincoln County, MT</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of timber harvest, reforestation, wildlife habitat enhancement (prescribed burning), construction of low standard
haul roads, and restriction of existing roads within the lower portion of the Fortine Creek drainage. The Fortine
Creek drainage is located approximately 40 air miles northeast of Libby, Montana near the town of Fortine, Montana.



The proposal's actions to harvest and reforest timber stands, construct and reconstruct roads, prescribed burning,
and restricting roads are being considered together because they represent either connected or cumulative actions
as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25). The purposes of the project are to maintain and
enhance winter thermal habitat requirements for whitetailed and mule deer, improve grizzly bear habitat by providing
security, cover, and forage, and maintain a healthy forest while providing timber to the local economy.

The EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and Final EIS of September 1987,
which provides overall guidance for achieving the desired forest condition of the area. All activities associated
with the proposal will be designed to maintain high quality wildlife, fisheries, and watershed objectives.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The decision area contains approximately 15,000 acres within the Kootenai National Forest in Lincoln County, Montana.
All of the proposed projects are located in the Fortine Creek drainage with sub-drainages of Deep, Brimstone, and
Murphy Creeks included. The legal location of the decision area is as follows: Sections 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 of Township 35 North, Range 25 West; Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 of Township 34 North, Range 25 West; Sections 25 and 36 of Township
35 North, Range 26 West; and Sections 1 and 12 of Township 34 North, Range 26 West; Principal Montana Meridian.




Some timber management and prescribed wildlife burning activities under consideration would occur within the Marston
Face Roadless Area X172 and the Thompson-Seton Roadless Area 483. No proposed activities are located in areas considered
for inclusion to the National Wilderness System as recommended by the Kootenai National Forest Plan or by any past
or present legislative wilderness proposals. Both even-aged and uneven-aged management would be used in implementing
the proposed actions. Logging systems consist of tractor harvest only.

The Forest Service proposes to harvest approximately 3.3 million board feet of timber through application of a variety
of harvest methods on approximately 1063 acres of forest land. The proposal also includes prescribed burning of 117
acres to enhance wildlife habitat. The Forest Service proposal also includes approximately 2.1 miles of new road
construction (0.9 miles of temporary road and 1.2 miles of low standard specified road) and approximately 1.0 mile
of road re-construction to access the specific harvest units. Approximately 15-18 miles of existing road is
also proposed for additional road use restrictions to improve wildlife habitat security.

The Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan provides overall management objectives in individual
delineated management areas (MA's). The proposed projects encompass three predominant MA's; 11, 13, and 14. Briefly
described, MA 11 is managed to maintain or enhance the winter-range habitat effectiveness for big-game species and
produce a programmed yield of timber. MA 14 focuses on maintaining or enhancing grizzly bear habitat, reducing grizzly/human
conflicts, assisting in the recovery of the grizzly bear, realizing a programmed yield of timber production, and
providing for the maintenance or enhancement of other wildlife species, especially big-game. MA 13 is designated
to provide the special habitat necessary for old growth dependent wildlife. Timber harvest is proposed only in MA
11. Prescribed burning for wildlife is the only activity proposed in MA 14. No activity is proposed in MA 13.

Issues



Tentatively, several issues of concern have been identified through the scoping process. These issues are briefly
described below:

 Whitetailed and Mule Deer Winter Thermal Cover_How would the proposed action maintain and enhance winter
thermal cover?

 Visuals_What effects would the proposed action have on naturally appearing views seen from trails, private
land, Dickey Lake and Highway 93?

 Timber Supply_How would the proposed action help satisfy local and national needs?

 Activity in Roadless Area_What effect would the proposal have on the roadless character of Marston Face and
Thompson-Seton Roadless Areas.

 Grizzly Bear_How would the proposal maintain and enhance grizzly bear habitat?

 Old Growth_What effect would the proposed action have on old growth habitat?

 Forest Health_Some stands are not growing at their full potential and some have sustained heavy mortality
due to the mountain pine beetle. What effect would the proposed action have to reduce susceptibility to bark beetles
and improve stand conditions?

 Water Quality_What effects would the proposed action have on riparian areas, lakes, and private water developments?



Public Involvement and Scoping



Public participation to this point has been extensive. On August 15, 1991 an initial scoping meeting was held with
the local community and interested individuals for the development of a timber sale proposal. On May 28, 1992 we held
another open house to present a revised proposal. In addition, a field trip to the Murphy Decision Area was conducted
on June 26, 1992 with seven individuals attending. Comments were requested in writing during all of these public involvement
efforts. Consultation with appropriate State and Federal agencies has been initiated. Preliminary effects analysis
indicated that the proposed action may significantly affect quality of the human environment and may substantially
alter the undeveloped character of the Marston Face Roadless Area. These potential effects prompted the decision
to prepare an EIS for the Murphy Timber Sales.

This environmental analysis and decision making process will unable additional interested and affected people
to participate and contribute to the final decision. Public participation will be requested at several points during
the analysis. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, local
agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed projects. This
input will be used in preparation of the draft and final EIS. The scoping process will include:

 Identifying potential issues.

 Identifying major issues to be analyzed in depth.

 Exploring additional alternatives which will be derived from issues recognized during scoping activities.

 Identifying potential environmental effects of this project and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects and connected actions).

The analysis will consider a range of alternatives, including the proposed action, no action, and other reasonable
action alternatives. 



Estimated Dates for Filing



The draft Murphy EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for
public review by September, 1994. At that time EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the Notice of Availability in the


Federal Register

.

The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by December, 1994. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making a decision regarding the proposal.



Reviewer's Obligations



The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the final
EIS. 

To be most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement
or the merit of the alternatives discussed. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of opportunity to join a cooperative research and development consortium .






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), seeks industrial and academic parties interested in
entering into a cooperative research consortium on the development of open systems technology for virtual libraries
and electronic document interchange. This program will be undertaken within the scope and confines of The Federal
Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the
authority to enter into cooperative research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute
personnel, equipment, and facilities_but no funds_to the cooperative research program. Members will be expected
to make contribution to the consortium's efforts in the form of materials, equipment, personnel, and/or funds. The
research program is expected to last two to three years. This is not a grant program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks industrial and academic parties interested in entering
into a cooperative research consortium on the development of open systems technology for virtual libraries and electronic
document interchange. NIST wishes to pursue interoperable and portable open systems that will improve the use of
information technology in conducting government programs and in providing services to the public, and, in particular,
improve the use and exchange of electronic documents in many forms as an aid to the performance of daily business activities
and research activities.




The open information systems movement is gaining momentum because many researchers and users realize that no single
vendor can supply all the needs for an information-based society. Open systems are needed to provide for interoperability
of software, hardware, and communications systems products, and for portability of data and applications across
heterogeneous computing environments. While there is a strong movement to standards for interconnecting hardware,
software and network systems, there are many proprietary products and systems in use. NIST has developed the application
Portability Profile (APP), the U.S. Government's Open system Environment Profile, which integrates standards
and other specifications to address a broad range of information technology requirements.

The purpose of this consortium is to develop technology that will promote the exchange of electronic documents and
improve user access to information in various forms and locations. This technology will fit into the APP framework.

This program is being undertaken within the scope and confines of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of an amendment to a fishery management plan; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS issues this notice that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 32 to
the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) for Secretarial review and is requesting comments
from the public. There is no proposed rule accompanying this amendment. Therefore, this is the final opportunity
to comment on this amendment.



Copies of the amendment may be obtained from the Council (see 

ADDRESSES

).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon receiving a fishery management plan or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the fishery management
plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received
during the comment period in determining public comments received during the comment period in determining whether
to approve the FMP or amendment.




Amendment 32 would establish a plan to rebuild stocks of the rockfish Pacific ocean perch (POP) (

Sebastes alutus

) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). POP is a highly valued groundfish. It was heavily exploited by a foreign trawl fleet from
the early 1960's until the mid-1980's. Thereafter, a domestic at-sea processing fleet harvested POP at a substantially
lower rate. Catches of POP peaked in 1965 when an estimated 350,000 metric tons (mt) were harvested by the foreign fleet;
catches declined sharply in the late 1960's. From 1961-1977, annual POP landings averaged over 40,000 mt; after
1977, landings averaged 6,000 mt. In the domestic fishery, POP was managed as part of a larger slope rockfish assemblage
of about 20 species until 1991, when POP was established as a separate target species category to prevent possible
overfishing.

As a result of increased concern about the status of POP stocks, biomass assessment methodology has been improved
and domestic harvest levels have been reduced. The 1993 total allowable catch (TAC) of 2,560 mt was available only
as incidental catch in other groundfish fisheries. In recent years POP has been managed as a single species, harvest
levels have been reduced, and directed fisheries have been restricted or eliminated. In spite of this conservative
management in recent years, POP biomass has increased only slightly and remains depressed from historic levels.
The current spawner biomass of about 71,000 mt is estimated to be 15-20 percent of the level observed during the
1960's.

The Council believes that increasing the biomass of POP to a level closer to historical amounts is necessary to achieve
optimum yield in the POP fishery. Factors other than fishing mortality contribute to the continued depressed state
of the POP resource. Ecosystem changes or other biological factors may preclude rebuilding success. Nevertheless,
the Council considers minimizing POP mortality necessary to maximize the probability of rebuilding success in a
realistic time period. Additionally, decreasing POP mortality should minimize resource waste associated with
low TACs that do not fully accommodate incidental catch needs of existing fisheries.

After a review of alternatives analyzed in the EA, the Council selected Alternative 3 as the preferred alternative.
This alternative is projected in modeling simulations to rebuild POP biomass to a target level (B

MSY

) in about 14 years by harvesting POP at a fishing mortality rate lower than the optimum rate. The target biomass B

MSY

 is the total biomass of mature females that would produce the maximum sustainable yield, on average; this number is
currently estimated at 150,000 mt. The optimal fishing mortality rate is the rate that maximizes expected biological
and economic yields over a range of plausible stock-recruitment relationships.

The Council considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 1, which no longer represents the best scientific information
about POP biomass and population dynamics. The Council also considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 2,
which would harvest POP at the higher optimal fishing mortality rate. The Council believed that lower POP harvests
and additional economic costs of Alternative 3 were justified because Alternative 2 would achieve the target biomass
in a longer time (about 18 years) and with a lower probability of rebuilding success. Alternative 4 would harvest POP
at a lower rate equivalent needed for unavoidable POP bycatch in remaining groundfish fisheries, at 1992 bycatch
rates. The TACs resulting from Alternative 4 were considered too restrictive in relation to existing POP bycatch
needs, causing unnecessary discards of POP that are killed in fishing operations after POP TACs are reached.

Under Alternative 3, the FMP would establish the procedure for deriving the annual GOA TACs for POP. POP stocks are
considered to be rebuilt when the total biomass of mature females is equal to, or greater than, B

MSY

. Annual TACs would be established as follows:

(a) Determine the current biomass, B

MSY

, and the optimal fishing mortality rate;

(b) Determine the fishing mortality rate halfway between the optimal fishing mortality rate and the fishing mortality
rate estimated to be sufficient to supply unavoidable bycatch of POP based on 1992 bycatch rates;

(c) When the current biomass of mature females is less than B

MSY

, adjust the resultant fishing mortality rate in (b) by the ratio of current biomass to B

MSY

 so that when B

MSY

 is attained, the fishing mortality rate will be the optimal fishing mortality rate;

(d) The GOA TAC of POP is the amount of fish resulting from the adjusted fishing mortality rate in (c); and

(e) The TAC is apportioned among regulatory areas in proportion to POP biomass distribution.

In addition to restricting the annual fishing mortality rate of POP, the Council seeks to reduce the total mortality
of POP in other target fisheries. In the past, overfishing has been defined GOA-wide. Under Amendment 32, the overfishing
level would be distributed among the eastern, central, and western areas in the same proportions as POP biomass occurs
in those areas. This measure would avoid localized depletion of POP and would rebuild POP at equal rates in all regulatory
areas of the GOA. The Council considers this management option necessary because, although POP biomass is greatest
in the Eastern Regulatory Area, most trawl fishing activity and incidental catch of POP is greatest in the Central
Regulatory Area. With an acceptable biological catch as low as the current, 3,378 mt in 1993, fishing mortality of
POP can be expected to exceed the TAC available in the central GOA.

Amendment 32 is necessary to improve conservation and management of POP and is intended to further the goals and objectives
of the FMP. No regulatory changes are necessary to implement this FMP amendment because the FMP would provide the procedure
for deriving TACs for POP, which are specified annually under existing regulations at  672.20(a)(2).

</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 21, 1993, President Clinton signed the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, that merged
the Commission on National and Community Service, ACTION, and the newly established Civilian Community Corps, to
create the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Corporation is presenting a series of regional workshops
in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, to provide application assistance to organizations applying
for national and community service program grants. 
 


Functioning as a service ``venture capitalist'', the Corporation will provide funding on a population-based formula
and competitive basis for national and community service programs, and as a clearinghouse of information and technical
expertise for service initiatives nationwide. 
 
To encourage broad participation in national service, the Corporation is conducting this series of workshops to
support the application of high quality, national service programs and service-learning K-12 and higher education
programs. Approximately $189 million will be available to these programs, to assist in the planning, operating and
replicating of national and community service programs. 
 
The primary audience for these workshops will be those applying directly to the Corporation, including State Commissions
or alternative entities, State educational agencies, higher education institutions, Indian Tribes, territories,
Federal agencies, professional corps, national nonprofits, and multi-State organizations. State Commissions
will be responsible for providing technical assistance to local applicants applying to their States. 
 
In addition, those local nonprofits organizations, government agencies, Indian Tribes, and higher education institutions
interested in applying for Summer of Safety should attend. 
 
For those who are unable to attend the workshops, the corporation will be sponsoring other assistance programs, including
tele/video-conferences and printed material. Please contact the Corporation at (202) 606-5000, or FAX (202)

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of the TRICARE Demonstration Project in California and Hawaii.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice was previously given in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 23783-23784) of June 24, 1988, that a demonstration project, called the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI),
would be conducted by contract under the provisions of chapter 55, title 10, section 1092, to test a different method
for financing and delivering health services under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services
(CHAMPUS). Delivery of services under that contract began August 1, 1988, for all beneficiaries who reside in the
states of California and Hawaii, and is scheduled to end January 31, 1994. The TRICARE demonstration project in California
and Hawaii is a continuation of the CRI demonstration project and includes five option periods, the execution of which
would result in five years of service delivery under the new contract. An evaluation of the significant new features
of the demonstration will be conducted. The objectives of the demonstration are to enhance beneficiary access and
continuity of care, contain health care costs, and improve coordination between the military and civilian components
of the Military Health Services System (MHSS).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The 

Federal Register

 Notice referenced above described in detail the CRI demonstration project, which includes a choice for beneficiaries
of three benefit options; CHAMPUS Prime, a health maintenance organization (HMO) benefit; CHAMPUS Extra, a preferred
provider organization (PPO) benefit; and standard CHAMPUS, an indemnity benefit. The benefit options under this
TRICARE demonstration (called TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Standard) are the same as those described
in the 

Federal Register

 Notice for the CRI demonstration. There are only five significant differences for beneficiaries and providers between
the CRI demonstration project and the TRICARE demonstration project in California and Hawaii:




_The new contractor is Aetna Government Health Plans. Aetna subcontracts with Hawaii Medical Service Association
(HMSA) for the provision of health care in Hawaii, and with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (operating
under the name of Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators) for claims processing services.

_Beneficiaries with a civilian Primary Care Manager (PCM) will need a referral in order to obtain covered services
at a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or a PRIMUS/NAVCARE clinic (except for emergency services, or for pharmacy
services obtained at an MTF).

_MTF Commanders may consider the availability of health care from civilian network providers, in addition to availability
from MTF providers, in determining whether to issue a Nonavailability Statement (NAS) to beneficiaries. Standard
NAS procedures for beneficiaries apply.

_The CHAMPUS home health care demonstration (as outlined in the CHAMPUS Operations Manual, Part Two, Chapter 20,
Addendum B) is included in this demonstration.

_Beneficiaries who receive care from network providers in the states of California and Hawaii, but who are not residents
of those states, obtain the TRICARE Extra benefits (payments based on discounted provider rates and reduced coinsurance).



Duration



It is expected that the demonstration status of this program will end upon promulgation of final regulations, expected
in 1994, which will provide permanent authority for implementation of managed care enrollment programs by the Department.
In any event, the effect of this Notice shall expire September 30, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Partial Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton Air Force Base (AFB), CA</DOCTITLE>


On December 15, 1993, the Air Force signed the Partial ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB. The decisions included
in this partial ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained in the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB, filed with the Environmental Protection Agency
on June 4, 1993.
Norton AFB will formally close on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure
and Realignment Act (BRAC) (Public Law 100-526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission
on Base Realignment and Closure. Pending closure of Norton AFB, this ROD documents the decisions made by the Air Force
on the division of parcels, the method parcels are to be conveyed or transferred, and the mitigation measures to be
adopted.
The primary decision in this ROD is to dispose of the aviation-related portion of Norton AFB in a manner that will enable
the development of a regional airport with the capacity for expanding commercial and industrial development. The
portion of the base covered by this ROD has been divided into ten (10) parcels. The airport parcel, including four (4)
non aviation revenue producing parcels, will be conveyed at no-cost via public benefit conveyance for airport purposes.
Three (3) parcels are to be offered for negotiated sale, and two (2) parcels will be reserved for transfer to another
Federal Agency. The Air Force decided to defer decisions on roads, utilities, and portions of Norton AFB not covered
by this ROD pending further analysis and review. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has jurisdiction by law
regarding reuse of the runways and associated facilities as a civilian airport. A decision, if any, by the FAA to approve
an airport layout plan (ALP) will be announced by a separate ROD issued by the FAA based on the analysis in the FEIS and
any additional FAA analysis that may be required.
The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal
adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statutes and regulations.
All reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment.
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E. B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696-5534.
Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209-2802.

ACTION: 

Notice of availability of record of decision (ROD).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Record of Decision (ROD) states the Army's intention to dispose of Fort Ord property, establish a Presidio of Monterey
Annex, and retain the existing reserve center at Fort Ord. Because the local communities' reuse plan has not been finalized,
the Army does not adopt a specific plan in this ROD. Rather, in this document the Army certifies that it has adequately
analyzed the environmental impacts of its decision to dispose of property at Fort Ord.


Consistent with the President's Five-Point Initiative to Revitalize Base Closure Communities, the Army will dispose
of property in accordance with the local communities' reuse plan to the maximum extent possible. The Army will develop,
if necessary, additional environmental analysis following this ROD to address the impacts of those uses in the local
communities' reuse plan not already addressed in the Environmental Impact Statement.
Based on this ROD, the Army will initiate the property disposal process at Fort Ord consistent with the analysis in
the EIS.

<DOCTITLE>Floodplain Statement of Findings for the Proposed Sanitary Sewer System Upgrade Project at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory </DOCTITLE>

 Department of Energy (DOE).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Floodplain statement of findings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed sanitary sewer project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL) prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 1022. DOE proposes to upgrade the sanitary sewer system to provide adequate
service in the main complex area and outlying regions of the Oak Ridge Reservation. Only certain sections of two subprojects
would be located in a 100-year floodplain. The East Area Sewer Main subproject would include installing approximately
2,900 linear feet of new sewer line that would lie within the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek located near Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. This line would be installed in a trench about 2 feet deep. After installation, the trench would
be backfilled and compacted. Finally, the area would be graded to original contour and seeded. The Sewer Main to Outlying
Areas subproject would install approximately 8,300 linear feet of new pipeline. The new pipeline would be located
in the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek only where the pipeline crosses White Oak Creek and an unnamed tributary
feeding the creek from the west. At these crossings, the pipeline would be placed on the existing causeways and adjacent
to the roadway. After installation, the area would be returned to the original condition. 



DOE prepared a floodplain and wetlands assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed
to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public
review after publication of the Statement of Findings before implementing the proposed action.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed sanitary sewer upgrade project at ORNL. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetlands
Involvement was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51624). DOE proposes to upgrade the sanitary sewer system to provide adequate service in the
main complex area and outlying regions of the reservation. These upgrades are needed because of the deterioration
in portions of the system, which are approaching 50-years of age; restrictive bends in sections of the piping; excessive
surface and subsurface infiltration during heavy rains; infiltration of ground water; high cost and potential environmental
damage of collecting, pumping, and hauling sanitary waste from holding tanks in the outlying areas; and lack of reserve
capacity during peak periods of use. Of the proposed upgrades, only certain sections of two subprojects would be located
in a 100-year floodplain. These subprojects would be the East Area Sewer Main and the Sewer Main to Outlying Areas.




The East Area Sewer Main subproject would include the installation of approximately 2,900 linear feet of new sewer
line that would lie within the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek. This line would be installed in a trench about
2 feet deep. After installation, the trench would be backfilled and compacted. Finally, the area would be graded to
original contour and seeded. 

Currently, facilities in the outlying areas of the plant use either collection tanks or septic systems. The waste
in the tanks is routinely pumped into trucks and taken to the main treatment plant. The cost of collection and maintenance
of the sanitary facilities in the outlying areas continues to increase. Additionally, this existing system can negatively
affect the environment. The objective of the Sewer Main to Outlying Areas subproject is to directly connect, via a
pipeline, these facilities to the main sewage treatment plant. Approximately 8,300 linear feet of new pipeline would
be installed. The new pipeline would be located in the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek only where the pipeline
crosses White Oak Creek and an unnamed tributary feeding the creek from the west. At these crossings, the pipeline
would be placed on the existing causeways and adjacent to the roadway. After installation, the area would be returned
to the original condition. 

Since the main facilities of ORNL were built along White Oak Creek, some upgrade projects naturally fall within the
floodplain. This is the case with the new sewer line in the East Area. The only practical route lies between White Oak
Creek and Southside Avenue, an area within the floodplain. The creek also separates the main complex from the outlying
areas. Thus, the sewer line to the outlying areas must cross over the existing causeways to avoid the installation
of new, separate crossings.

Several alternatives were evaluated. A no action alternative was evaluated for both subprojects. Two alternative
routes for the new sewer main in the East Area were examined. An alternative route for the sewer main to the outlying
areas was not evaluated since the only practical route follows the existing creek crossings. 

The proposed upgrades occurring in the floodplain would not have any long-term effects upon the floodplain or surrounding
environment. Only during construction could the project potentially affect the floodplain or the aquatic life in
White Oak Creek and the impacts, if any, would be negligible. During construction, sediment could be introduced into
the creek and unnamed tributary. DOE will prepare a sediment control plan identifying the best management practices
to be employed during construction to minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. Control measures
would include the use of sediment and erosion control fences to minimize siltation. Procedural measures would include
excavating trenches of the minimum size and performing construction activities during dry periods. Immediately
upon installation of sections of the sewer line, the trench would be backfilled and compacted. The area would then
be graded to the original contour and seeded. The upgrade project would conform to all applicable State and local floodplain
protection standards. 

DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the Statement of Findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

<USBUREAU>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</USBUREAU>





South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. and Duke Power Co.; Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment
and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings and Site Visit 



December 28, 1993. 



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for relicensing of the existing Gaston
Shoals Project, Project No. 2332, Ninety-nine Islands Project, Project No. 2331, and Neal Shoals Project, Project
No. 2315. All the projects are located on the Broad River. Gaston Shoals and Ninety-nine Islands are located near Gaffney,
South Carolina. Neal Shoals is located near Carlisle, South Carolina. 

The FERC staff intends to prepare a Multiple Environmental Assessment (MEA) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance
with the National Environmental Policy Act. 

The MEA will consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the projects and reasonable alternatives,
and will include an economic and engineering analysis. 

A draft MEA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft MEA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in the final MEA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be
presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. 



Scoping Meetings 



Two scoping meetings will be conducted:




February 2, 1994, 10 a.m., U.S. Forest Service, 3557 Whitmire Highway Union, South Carolina 


February 2, 1994, 7 p.m., the theater at Chester Park Elementary, School Complex Highway Number 9, Chester, South
Carolina. 

 



Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the
staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the MEA. The morning meeting is oriented
toward the resource agencies and the evening meeting toward the public. 

To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the MEA will
be mailed to agencies, organizations, and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping
document will also be available at the scoping meetings. 



Objectives 



At the scoping meeting, the FERC staff will: (1) identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed
projects; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis;
(3) identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the MEA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the MEA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of,
the staff's preliminary views. 



Procedures 



Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the MEA. 

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings but who have views on issues or information relevant to the issues may
submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meeting. In addition, written comments may be
filed with the 

Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, 

until March 4, 1994. 

All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: 

Gaston Shoals Project, FERC No. 2332, Ninety-nine Islands Project, FERC No. 2331, and Neal Shoals Project, FERC No.
2315. 

Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular
resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency. 



Site Visit 



A site visit to the Gaston Shoals, Ninety-nine Islands and Neal Shoals Projects is planned for February 1, 1994. Those
who wish to attend should plan to meet at the Gaston Shoals Powerhouse at 9:30 A.M. Any questions regarding the site
visit or this notice should be directed to Tim Looney at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Hydropower
Licensing, 
825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 219-2852.

Floodplain statement of findings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is a floodplain statement of findings for the Fort Morgan North Tapline Project prepared in accordance with 10
CFR part 1022. Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposes to construct 3 miles of new 115-kilovolt (kV)
tapline in Morgan County, Colorado. The tapline would connect Western's existing Beaver Creek-Weld 115-kV transmission
line with Morgan County Rural Electric Association's (MCREA) new Fort Morgan North Substation. The Fort Morgan North
Tapline would cross the floodplain of the South Platte River in Morgan County, Colorado. Western prepared a floodplain
and wetlands assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize potential
harm to or within the affected floodplain. This action is categorically excluded under the DOE's National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021). Western will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review
after publication of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a floodplain statement of findings for the Fort Morgan North 115-kV Tapline Project prepared in accordance
with 10 CFR part 1022. A notice of floodplain and wetlands involvement was published in the 

Federal Register

 (FR) on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51623). Western is proposing to construct 3 miles of 115-kV tapline between Western's
existing Beaver Creek-Weld 115-kV transmission line and MCREA's proposed new Fort Morgan North Substation. The
tapline would be single circuit and would be constructed on single wood-pole structures. Approximately 13 wood-pole
structures and two span structures (steel H-frame design) would be located within the floodplain of the South Platte
River. Existing access is available along most of the proposed tapline right-of-way. New access trails may be required
to access span structures located on either side of the river crossing. No construction would occur within the river.
The tapline would span the active channel of the South Platte River. Approximately 600 square feet of riparian woodland
would be removed on either side of the river for the construction of the two span structures. This would be a direct long-term
impact. About 0.8 acre would be maintained as riparian shrubland as a result of project maintenance and would also
be a direct long-term impact. Approximately 2 acres would be temporarily affected during construction for equipment
and construction material staging and would be a minor short-term impact. No watercourses or drainage patterns would
be altered by the project. Flood storage volume would not be affected. The action would conform with applicable State
or local floodplain protection standards. This action is categorically excluded under the DOE's NEPA Implementing
Procedures (10 CFR part 1021).




Western will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Betaseron

 

</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Betaseron

 

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human biologic product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human biologic product Betaseron

 

 (Interferon 

beta

-1b). Betaseron

 

 is indicated for use in ambulatory patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency
of clinical exacerbations. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration
application for Betaseron

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,588,585) from the Cetus Oncology Corp., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance
in determining the patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated October 26, 1993, FDA advised
the Patent and Trademark Office that this human biologic product had undergone a regulatory review period and that
the approval of Betaseron

 

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Betaseron

 

 is 3,720 days. Of this time, 3,319 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 401
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: May 19, 1983. The applicant claims April 4, 1986, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became
effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was May 19, 1983, which was 30 days after FDA receipt
of the IND.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 351 of the Public
Health Service Act

: June 18, 1992. The applicant claims June 16, 1992, as the date the product license application (PLA) for Betaseron

 

 (PLA 92-0495) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that PLA 92-0495 was initially
submitted on June 18, 1992.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: July 23, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that PLA 92-0495 was approved on July 23, 1993. 
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,500 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before March 7, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before July 5, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>AVRE Inc.; Revocation of U.S. License No. 1074-003</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No.
1074-003) and the product license issued to AVRE Inc., (AVRE) for the manufacture of Source Plasma. AVRE has
several locations. Only the Tacoma location is affected by this revocation. In a letter to FDA dated June 30, 1993,
AVRE requested that its establishment and product licenses at the Tacoma location be revoked and thereby waived its
opportunity for a hearing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA announces the revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No. 1074-003) and the product license
issued to AVRE Inc., 10506 Bridgeport Way SW., Tacoma, WA 98499, for the manufacture of Source Plasma. Other locations
under the AVRE license are not affected by this revocation. The licenses were revoked for the Tacoma location of AVRE
only. 


 FDA inspected the Tacoma location of AVRE on April 7 through 21, 1993. During that inspection, FDA observed numerous
deviations from the standards established in the license as well as the applicable Federal regulations. The inspection
documented serious deviations from the applicable Federal regulations and standards established in the license.
These deviations included, but were not limited to, the following: 
1. Failure to follow adequate written standard operating procedures (SOP's) for determining donor suitability
(21 CFR 606.100(b)), in that four donors were allowed to donate Source Plasma more than twice during a 7-day period;
five donors were allowed to donate Source Plasma who had experienced a weight loss of greater than 10 pounds within
a 2-month period without first being referred to a physician or physician substitute; and educational information
provided to donors did not reference a temperature greater than 100.5 




F for more than 10 days as a symptom of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
2. Failure to follow adequate written SOP's for the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of blood and
blood components for further manufacturing (21 CFR 606.100(b)), in that AVRE collected an amount of plasma from at
least three donors that exceeded the maximum volume allowed by AVRE's plasma volume nomogram, AVRE's donor record
files for at least 20 donors, 6 with multiple donations, did not contain photographs; and AVRE did not have its physician
or physician substitute evaluate one donor who exhibited a temperature below 97.0 




F.
3. Failure to maintain complete, accurate, and concurrent records that clearly traced the steps of each significant
procedure in the collection, processing, and storage of the blood products so as to provide a complete history of work
performed (21 CFR 606.160), in that AVRE was unable to trace two unit numbers to the donors, AVRE misspelled the last
name of at least one donor in the deferral file, and AVRE had no unit number in its donor record file for at least one donation.

4. Failure to observe, standardize, and calibrate equipment (21 CFR 606.60(a)), in that during October 1992, AVRE
failed to clean the air filters on four Autopheresis-C machines.
FDA determined that the nature of the deficiencies found at AVRE showed a pattern of careless disregard for the standards
established in the license and the Federal regulations that are designed to ensure the continued safety, purity,
and potency of the manufactured product and that willfulness existed. The recent inspection showed that corrective
actions promised in response to a March through April 1992 inspection, which resulted in suspension of AVRE's license,
were not implemented or were not effective in achieving long-term compliance. In a letter to AVRE dated May 27, 1993,
FDA delineated the observations listed above, provided notice that FDA intended to institute proceedings to revoke
U.S. License 1074-003 issued to AVRE pursuant to 21 CFR 601.5(b). In accordance with 21 CFR 601.5(b), the letter
advised AVRE that no additional time would be provided to achieve compliance with the regulations before FDA would
institute proceedings to revoke the licenses of AVRE. The letter further announced its intent to offer an opportunity
for a hearing. In a letter to FDA dated June 30, 1993, AVRE voluntarily requested that its licenses for the Tacoma location
be revoked and thereby waived its opportunity for a hearing. In a letter dated November 8, 1993, FDA acknowledged voluntary
revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No. 1074-003) and the aforementioned product license
of AVRE at the Tacoma location only. 
FDA has placed copies of letters relevant to the license revocations on file under the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. These documents are available for public examination in the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Accordingly, under 21 CFR 601.5 and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), and under authority
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director, Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.68), the establishment license (U.S. License No. 1074-003) and the product
license issued to the Tacoma location of AVRE Inc., for the manufacture of Source Plasma were revoked, effective November
8, 1993.
This notice is issued and published under 21 CFR 601.8 and under authority delegated to the Director of the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.67).

<DOCTITLE>Milliken Chemical; Filing of Food Additive Petition; Amendment</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the filing notice for a food additive petition filed by Milliken
Chemical to indicate that the petitioned additive, dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol, is also intended for use in
high-propylene olefin copolymers for use in contact with food. The previous filing notice stated that the additive
was intended for use only in polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1993 (58 FR 21583), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 2B4341) had been filed on behalf of Milliken Chemical,
c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001, proposing that the food additive regulations in  178.3295


Clarifying agents for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.3295) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent for
polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food.


Upon further review of the petition, the agency notes that the petitioner had requested use of the additive as a clarifying
agent in high-propylene olefin copolymers in addition to its use in polypropylene films. Therefore, FDA is amending
the filing notice of April 22, 1993, to state that the petitioner requested that the food additive regulations be amended
to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent in polypropylene and high-propylene
olefin copolymers for use in contact with food.
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of the notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. FDA will also place on public display any
amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. Interested persons may, on or before February 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. If, based on its review, the
agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the
notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and evidence supporting that finding will
be published with the final regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA provides research contracts to the NAS/IOM to support the preparation of the Food Chemicals Codex, a compendium
of specifications for substances used as food ingredients. Before the inclusion of any specifications in a Food Chemicals
Codex publication, public announcement will be made in the 

Federal Register

. All interested parties are invited to comment and to make suggestions for consideration. Suggestions should be
accompanied by supporting data or documentation to facilitate and expedite review by the Committee on Food Chemicals
Codex.



In the 

Federal Registers

 of January 11, 1991 (56 FR 1198), and April 9, 1991 (56 FR 14382), FDA announced that the NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals
Codex was considering new monographs and monograph revisions for inclusion in the third supplement to the Food Chemicals
Codex, third edition, which has since been published. In the 

Federal Register

 of November 22, 1991 (56 FR 58910), FDA announced that the NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals Codex was considering
new monographs and monograph revisions for inclusion in the fourth supplement to the Food Chemicals Codex, third
edition, which also has been published. Both supplements are available from the National Academy Press at the address

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the Commissioner's MED

WATCH

 Conference on Drug and Device-Induced Disease: Developing a Blueprint for the Future. The conference is co-sponsored
by FDA and the American Medical Association (AMA) in cooperation with the following organizations: American Association
of Colleges of Nursing, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Association of Dental Schools, American
Dental Association, American Hospital Association, American Nursing Association, American Society of Clinical
Pharmacology and Therapeutics, American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, Association of American Medical Colleges,
and the Council on Education in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Drug and device-induced diseases are serious health problems. It is estimated that 2 to 10 percent of all hospitalizations
are a result of serious adverse events. The purpose of this conference is to develop recommendations on ways to heighten
health professionals' awareness of the extent and spectrum of drug and device-induced disease and to break down barriers
to the discovery and reporting of important adverse events to FDA and manufacturers by: (1) Strengthening undergraduate
curricula, (2) enhancing postgraduate training, and (3) building user-friendly reporting mechanisms for health
professionals.


David A. Kessler, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and James S. Todd, Executive Vice President of the AMA, will be the
keynote speakers.
The conference should be of interest to the following groups: Practicing health professionals, health professional
organizations, health professions educators (undergraduate and graduate), health professionals of State health
departments, regulatory and safety surveillance professionals, and hospital personnel (e.g, risk managers/quality
assurance personnel and members of Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees).
This is a participatory conference. Recommendations from the breakout sessions will be presented on the second day
of the conference and their implementation discussed at the final panel discussion.

ACTION:

 Proposed notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the Medicare program's proposal to revise its national policy by withdrawing coverage for
diagnostic nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing in the sleep disorder clinic. For all other settings, we are
proposing to exclude rather than withdraw coverage because the Medicare program does not have a national policy that
provides for coverage of NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in settings other than sleep
disorder clinics. Public Health Service studies show that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence.
Therefore, it does not meet HCFA's criteria for effectiveness.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background 


A. Introduction 


Administration of the Medicare program is governed by the Medicare statute, title XVIII of the Social Security Act
(the Act). The Congress intended, at the time Medicare was enacted in 1965, that Medicare provide health insurance
to protect the elderly (and later, the disabled) from the substantial costs of health care services. The Medicare
law provides coverage for broad categories of benefits, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, skilled
nursing facility (SNF) care, home health care, and physicians' services. 
The Medicare program consists of two separate but complementary health insurance programs, a Hospital Insurance
(HI) program (known as Part A) and a Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program (known as Part B). Although Part
A is called Hospital Insurance, covered benefits also include medical services furnished in SNFs or by home health
agencies (HHAs) and hospices. For purposes of the Medicare program, we refer to these entities as ``providers.''
These providers must be certified as qualified providers of services and must sign an agreement to participate in
the program. Part B covers a wide range of medical services and supplies such as those furnished by physicians, providers,
or others in connection with physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy
and occupational therapy services, and home health services. Physicians' services covered under Part B include
visits to patients in the home, office, hospital, and other institutions. Part B also covers certain drugs and biologicals,
diagnostic x-ray and laboratory tests, purchase or rental of durable medical equipment (DME), ambulance services,
prosthetic devices, and certain medical supplies. 
While the Medicare law provides coverage for the broad categories of benefits described above, it also places categorical
limitations on the coverage of the services furnished by certain health care practitioners, such as dentists, chiropractors,
and podiatrists, and it specifically excludes some categories of services from coverage, such as cosmetic surgery,
personal comfort items, custodial care, and routine physical checkups. The statute also provides direction as to
the manner in which payment is made for Medicare services, the rules governing eligibility for services, and the health,
safety, and quality standards to be met by providers and some types of suppliers that furnish services to Medicare
beneficiaries. 
The Medicare law does not, however, provide an all-inclusive list of specific items, services, treatments, procedures,
or technologies covered by Medicare. Thus, except for the examples of DME in section 1861(n) of the Act, some of the
medical and other health services listed in section 1861(s) of the Act, and exclusions from coverage listed in section
1862(a) of the Act, the statute does not specify medical devices, surgical procedures, or diagnostic and therapeutic
services that should be covered or excluded from coverage. 
The Congress understood that questions about coverage for specific services would arise and would require us to make
specific decisions about coverage. Thus, it gave the Secretary the authority to make those decisions. Section 1862(a)(1)(A)
of the Act prohibits payment for items or services that ``are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment
of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.'' 
We have interpreted this statutory provision to exclude from Medicare coverage those medical and other health care
services that are not demonstrated to be safe or effective. Effectiveness in this context is the probability of benefit
to individuals from a medical item, service, or procedure for a given medical problem under average conditions of
use; that is, day-to-day medical practice. In day-to-day medical practice, physicians diagnose and treat clinical
conditions following inquiry into an individual's medical history, performance of a physical examination, and
interpretations of a variety of diagnostic tests and procedures. To be of value to the physician, the information
obtained from any diagnostic test or procedure must be sufficiently accurate to provide a reasonably reliable measure
for establishing or ruling out the presence of a given disease. Payment may not be made under Medicare for any diagnostic
test or procedure that does not produce accurate results when properly performed, since that test cannot be considered
``reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury.''

B. Medicare Coverage of Diagnostic Nocturnal Penile Tumescence Testing (Testing for Impotence) 


Impotence is the inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory intercourse and
is considered by Medicare to be the failure of a body part when the diagnosis, and frequently the treatment, require
medical expertise. Impotence can be organic or psychogenic in origin. The focus of diagnostic tests is to determine
the origin of impotence to establish the appropriate treatment. 
Currently, Medicare covers diagnostic NPT testing by plethysmography (for example, mercury strain gauges) and
other monitoring devices in a sleep disorder clinic to determine whether erectile impotence is organic or psychogenic.
Although impotence is not a sleep disorder, the nature of the testing requires that it be performed while the patient
sleeps. In the past, it was believed that patients with predominantly psychogenic impotence would regularly attain
normal erections during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, while patients with organic impotence would not demonstrate
significant sleep-associated normal erections. 
During NPT testing, mercury strain gauges placed on the shaft of the penis can detect and measure changes in penile
circumference during sleep. A normal result of NPT, measured with strain gauges, is two or more periods of sustained
erections lasting more than 20 minutes and associated with at least a 25-mm increase in penile circumference. Normal
NPT in a person with sexual dysfunction implies intact neurovascular structures and suggests psychogenic impotence.
An abnormal recording, however, is not definitive and only suggests organic impotence and will require further testing
for a more definite diagnosis. In addition, NPT testing has a high incidence (15 to 20 percent) of false-positive and,
although not as common, false-negative findings. 
Currently, diagnostic NPT testing in a sleep disorder clinic is listed as covered under ``Sleep Disorder Clinics''
in section 3112.5 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13-3) and section 2055 of the Medicare Carriers
Manual (HCFA Pub. 14-3), under limited circumstances, for example, to confirm appropriate treatment and for
a maximum of 2 nights of testing. Section 35-24, ``Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence,'' of the Medicare Coverage
Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6), does not address the use of plethysmography, a non-specific test for vascular competence,
which may include monitoring devices, rigidometers, strain gauges, and stamp tests. However, we are revising this
manual section to state that plethysmography is noncovered for use in the diagnosis of impotence because it does not
indicate the rigidity and the duration of tumescence, both of which are necessary components in the evaluation of
impotence. (Before publication, RS will confirm the status of this manual instruction.) 


 C. Recommendations to Withdraw Coverage for Diagnostic Nocturnal Penile Tumescence Testing in a Sleep Disorder
Clinic 


In 1986, a Medicare contractor requested advice about paying for items and services related to impotence testing.
Medicare coverage instructions on the diagnosis and treatment of impotence did not specifically address the issues
of plethysmography and in-home impotence testing devices. At that time, two monitoring devices had been developed
for in-home testing under a physician's direction: the Snap-gauge, which measures the tumescence of the penis during
sleep, and Rigiscan, which measures the duration and frequency of erections as well as the degree of rigidity and tumescence
during sleep. 
As a result, we consulted the HCFA Physicians Panel, a group of staff physicians and other health professionals in
HCFA's central office and their counterparts in the Public Health Service (PHS). They advised us to ask PHS, through
the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA), to assess the safety and effectiveness of the principal diagnostic
tests for impotence currently in use. (Our current process for making coverage decisions is discussed in the January
30, 1989, proposed rule entitled ``Medicare Program Criteria and Procedures for Making Medical Services Coverage
Decisions that Relate to Health Care Technology'' 
(54 FR 4305)).

<TEXT>
 

In September 1986, we asked OHTA to conduct a full assessment of the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests for
impotence and the methods for treating impotence. To conduct this assessment, OHTA solicited information from manufacturers,
researchers, other government agencies, other components of PHS, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). OHTA
also evaluated the latest scientific studies, medical literature, information from medical specialty groups,
and respondents to the March 19, 1987, notice entitled ``National Center for Health Services Research and Health
Care Technology Assessment; Assessment of Medical Technology'' (54 FR 8648). In that notice, OHTA announced that
it was assessing the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatment methods for impotence. OHTA researched
and analyzed published medical and scientific literature and relevant studies and reports. 

At the time we received the OHTA assessment on the diagnosis and treatment for impotence dated October 31, 1989, we
asked for an assessment on sleep disorders. (Since December 1989, OHTA has been a part of PHS' Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research.) The OHTA assessment, ``Sleep Disorders,'' dated February 3, 1992, did not raise issues that
would result in further coverage changes. Although OHTA's assessment on the diagnosis and treatment of impotence
was issued 3 years ago, we have determined that the medical evidence and conclusions of the assessment are still accurate
based on our own medical expertise and a thorough review of all the medical literature on the subject since 1989. 

The OHTA assessment, ``Public Health Service Assessment_The Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence'' includes a
bibliography of studies evaluating the effectiveness of various types of impotence testing and treatment. (Copies
of this assessment may be obtained from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Publications Clearinghouse,
P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, MD 20907; Toll Free: 1-800-358-9295.) In the assessment, OHTA concluded
that reliable tests for evaluating impotence include Doppler ultrasound, arteriography, cavernosography, cavernosometry,
hormonal assays, and electrophysiological testing. NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices
in the clinical setting or in the home is determined to be unreliable. 

According to OHTA, there are no accepted standards for NPT test results. Results cannot be compared among laboratories
because each laboratory has its own set of standards by which to evaluate NPT. False-positive and false-negative
results occur frequently indicating that NPT testing is not a reliable index for differentiating organic from psychogenic
impotence, thereby making it impossible to choose the appropriate treatment. Also, OHTA does not consider other
in-home monitoring devices to be reliable for diagnosing impotence. 



II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice 



Based on the conclusion of the OHTA technology assessment that scientific evidence indicates that NPT testing is
not a reliable index for evaluating impotence, we have concluded that NPT testing does not meet our criteria for effectiveness.
Therefore, we propose to revise our national policy by withdrawing coverage for NPT testing in the sleep disorder
clinic. We do not have a national policy regarding NPT testing in other settings. Therefore, we propose to exclude
coverage for NPT testing, rather than withdraw coverage, in all other settings. Because NPT test results are not standardized
and are frequently inaccurate and have a high rate of false-positive and false-negative results, the appropriate
treatment cannot be determined. 

The provisions of this notice would not affect existing Medicare regulations. However, they would affect the following
manual instructions: 

 Section 2055 of the Medicare Carriers Manual (HCFA Pub. 14-3). 
 Section 3112.5 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13-3). 
 Section 35-24 of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6).

III. Regulatory Impact Statement 



A. Executive Order 12291



Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any notice
that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_

 An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; 

 A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government
agencies, or geographic regions; or 

 Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the
ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.



We propose to revise our national policy and to withdraw Medicare program coverage for NPT testing in the sleep disorder
clinic. Because we do not have a national policy regarding NPT testing in other settings, we propose to exclude coverage,
rather than withdraw coverage, for NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in all other settings.
In calendar year 1992, Medicare payment for NPT testing totaled approximately $840,000 for 13,000 allowed services.
This is an increase of approximately 26 percent in expenditures and a 3 percent increase in the number of services over
the previous year. We anticipate that future costs or savings as a result of this notice would be negligible. This notice
would not meet the $100 million criterion nor would it meet the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this notice is
not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all physicians, sleep disorder clinics, and manufacturers
of devices for performing the NPT test are considered to be small entities. 


In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

Currently, Medicare covers diagnostic NPT testing. Although impotence is not a sleep disorder, the nature of the
testing requires that it be performed while a patient sleeps. As discussed in detail in section I.C. of this notice,
the OHTA technology assessment has concluded that NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic is not a reliable index
for evaluating impotence. False-positive and false-negative results occur frequently indicating that NPT testing
is not a reliable indicator for choosing the appropriate treatment. Based on scientific evidence that indicates
that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence, we have concluded that NPT testing does not meet
our criteria for effectiveness, a primary requirement for Medicare program coverage. We believe the test has not
been performed often by medical practitioners because of the test's limited value. Therefore, we propose to withdraw
Medicare coverage of NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic and exclude coverage of NPT testing by plethysmography
and other monitoring devices in all other settings. Our decision to withdraw coverage should have only a minimal effect
on small entities. 

Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined,
and the Secretary certifies, that this notice would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.




IV. Response to Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment,
we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the DATES

 section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document. 



V. Collection of Information Requirements 



This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501

Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program Attachment to SF 83_Supporting Statement



A. Justification



1. The statute requires that data demonstrating eligibility must be submitted as part of the nomination for Empowerment
Zone/Enterprise Community designation, as well as the Strategic Plan addressing problems in the nominated area
which will serve as the basis for designation by the appropriate Secretary. In addition the statute requires that
the nomination for designation include benchmarks established by the nominee for measuring the success of the nominees
plan implementation. Modification of the boundaries of the zone or lack of progress in achieving the benchmarks set
forth in the strategic plan is indicated in the statute as grounds for a revokation by the appropriate Secretary of
the designation. Therefore, we will ask for periodic (annual) reports from the designated Empowerment Zones and
Enterprise Communities in which they indicate how they are progressing against the benchmarks they established.
We do not have a specific form which must be used to make this report.

a. Nomination.

(A) Eligibility factors include documentation of specific levels of poverty by census tract, pervasive poverty
and general distress. In addition, parameters of geographic size and population are included.

(B) The statute provides that in making designations, the Secretary will consider the effectiveness of the strategic
plan, the effectiveness of the assurances provided and the other criteria which may be specified by the appropriate
Secretary.

b. Periodic (annual) performance reports. As indicated above this report will be submitted by the designated Empowerment
Zones and Enterprise Communities to show their progress in achieving the benchmarks set forth in their strategic
plans. The appropriate Secretary will use the information submitted to evaluate the success of the Empowerment Zones
and Enterprise Communities as indicated in the statute.

2. Purpose and use of the information.

The nominations will be used by HUD and USDA to evaluate the eligibility of the nominated areas and make designations
of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in accordance with the designation criteria set forth in the statute.


The period reports will be used as required by the statute to determine the success of each designee in meeting its established
benchmarks and in evaluating the program as a whole.

3. Use of information technology to reduce burden_not applicable.

4. Effort to identify duplication.

These requirements are the minimum necessary to meet the requirements of the statute and put the Program into effect.

5. Availability of similar information.

While available information can be used to prepare the nomination and develop the strategic plan, the statute requires
that the nominee develop this information for an area it selects.

6. Small business involvement_not applicable.

7. Consequence of less frequent information collection.

We judge periodic reports to be the minimum needed to administer the program in conformance with the statute.

8. Inconsistency with 5 CFR 1320.6_not applicable.

9. Persons consulted.

HUD and USDA have worked together to prepare joint applications for the Program. The following agencies were consulted
during the preparation and development of the program:




Commerce Department_Larry Parks 

Education Department_Mike Smith 

Housing and Human Services_David Ellwood

Justice_Eleanor Acheson

Labor_Larry Katz

OMB_Chris Edley

ONDCP_Ed Jurith

SBA_Erskine Bolles

DPC_Bruce Reed

NEC_Paul Dimond

V.P._Kumiki Gibson




10. Assurance of confidentiality_not applicable.

11. Questions of a sensitive nature_not applicable.

12. Cost estimates.








These figures are based on an estimate of the number of applications expected and the assumption that HUD and USDA will
designate the full EZs and ECs authorized in the statute. These figures were then multiplied by the number of hours
estimated for preparation or review for each requirement.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Amend Resource Management Plan; Realty Action, Grant County, Oregon</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

Bureau of Land Management, Interior, Prineville District.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to amend the John Day Resource Management Plan; notice of realty action_exchange of public land in
Grant County, Oregon.









In accordance with 43 CFR 1601.3, notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management in the State of Oregon, Prineville
District, intends to amend that portion of the John Day Resource Management Plan (RMP) within the Prineville District.
The existing RMP was approved in August 1985 and provides management direction and resource allocations for all BLM-managed
lands in Grant County located in central and northeastern Oregon.

The amendment is to specifically identify public lands in the Central Oregon Resource Area located in Grant County
for retention or disposal and to identify, generally, private land that may be suitable for acquisition through exchange,
purchase or donation. All acquisitions will be on a ``willing buyer_willing seller'' basis. Presently, there are
over 180,000 acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Grant County, which contains a total of
approximately 3,000,000 acres of land. While the John Day RMP does identify public land suitable for sale, it does
not specifically identify public lands suitable for exchange or other realty actions. It also does not identify which
of the BLM-managed public lands should be retained for multiple use or what privately-owned lands may be suitable
for acquisition.

Additionally, this notice serves as the Notice of Realty Action as required by 43 CFR part 2200. The Prineville District
is considering five exchange proposals affecting 8,340 acres of public land described as follows:



Exchange 1






Exchange 2





Exchange 3





Exchange 4

Exchange 5





The adjoining landowner would like to acquire the tracts noted below and various proposals have been discussed. Although
specific tracts have not been offered in exchange for the public land, the BLM would consider trading these tracts
for private land along the North or South Forks of the John Day River.











In exchange for these lands, the Federal Government may acquire the following:




Exchange 1









Exchange 2







Exchange 3









Exchange 4

Exchange 5



Tracts to be acquired have not yet been identified, but the proponent has offered to purchase land along the North or
South Forks of the John Day River.

Appraisals for these exchanges have not yet been completed. Therefore, the amount of land traded may be different
than that shown after values are equalized.

The purpose of the exchanges are to acquire and block up lands in Grant County, particularly along the forks of the John
Day River. These lands have high public value for riparian, fisheries, wildlife, recreation and scenic quality.
Acquisition of this land would be consistent with the Bureau's planning system after the plan is amended. The value
of the lands has not been determined; however, upon completion of the final appraisal, the acreage will be adjusted
or money will be used to equalize values. The public lands will be transferred subject to: (1) A reservation to the United
States of a rights-of-way for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States, Act of Aug. 30, 1890
(43 U.S.C. 945); (2) All valid existing rights-of-way, leases, permits or licenses in effect at the time of exchange.
The mineral estate is expected to be included in the exchange. 

Interest has also been expressed in a tract of public land described as: 




n,s




This land would be retained for use associated specifically with the airport and allow for expansion of airport activities.
If not used in conjunction with the airport, the tract will become available for exchange.

The publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 segregates the public lands described above from appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining
laws, but not from exchange pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

This segregative effect shall terminate upon issuance of a patent to such lands, upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 of a Notice of Termination of the segregation or 18 months from date of this publication, whichever occurs first.




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Copies of the scoping document, as well as detailed information concerning the proposed exchanges and land use plan
amendment, are available for review at the Prineville District Office, 185 East Fourth St., Prineville, OR 97754,
(503) 447-4115 and the Central Oregon Resource Area, 2321 E. Third St., (503) 447-7003. Contact Dick Cosgriffe,
Area Manager or Ron Lane, Realty Specialist.




PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN AMENDMENT: 

Major issues involved in the plan amendment are the identification of public lands in the Central Oregon Resource
Area located in Grant County for retention for multiple use management, the identification of public lands suitable
for disposal by sale, exchange or public purpose lease, the general identification of areas of private land suitable
for acquisition and access to the public lands by people of the United States.



Disciplines to be represented on the interdisciplinary team preparing the plan amendment and associated Environmental
Assessment (EA) are: Wildlife, fisheries, recreation, watershed, lands and realty, cultural, forestry, economics
and land use planning. Copies of the scoping document, as well as more detailed information are available at the Prineville
District Office or the Central Oregon Resource Area Office, both located in Prineville, Oregon.

A 45-day period for public review and comment is provided to meet the requirements for both the Notice of Intent and
Notice of Realty Action. Scoping of issues and management alternatives which have been identified will also be refined
through this process. The 45-day comment period will begin with the publication of this Notice in the Federal Register.
There will be an open house in Prineville on February 2, 1994, in the BLM office at 2321 E. Third Street from 10 a.m. to
3 p.m. to provide information and answer questions regarding the proposals in this plan. A public meeting will also
be held in John Day on February 3, 1994 at 7 p.m. in the Grant County Senior Center, located at 142 NE Dayton Street. Additional
meetings and a 60-day public comment opportunity will be provided upon completion of the draft management plan amendment
and environmental assessment in the spring of 1994. Dates, times and locations of those meetings and public comment
opportunities will be published in the 

Federal Register

, as well as in local newspapers. Notices will also be mailed to all known interested parties.

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the lesser long-nosed bat (

Leptonycteris curasoae yerbabuenae

) which the Service listed as an endangered species in 1988 (FR 38460; September 30, 1988). The lesser long-nosed bat
occurs in southern Arizona, southwest New Mexico and the western and southern portions of Mexico. This species is
migratory and is found in the United States during the summer. The Service solicits review and comment from the public
on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background




Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe the site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and
survival of the species, establish objectives, and measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting
or delisting species, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.


The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service, and other affected Federal
agencies, will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.




The lesser long-nosed bat occurs in caves and mines in southern Arizona from approximately May through September.
Both maternity colonies and night roosts are found in the state. Wintering areas for bats that summer in the United
States are not defined. Maternity colonies and other types of roosts are found in western and southern Mexico. Management
issues and concerns include mining activities, disturbance of foraging areas, animal control actions, and human
disturbance of roost sites.


The lesser long-nosed bat recovery plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in Region 2 and was developed
with input from selected experts on the biology of the species. The plan will be finalized and approved following incorporation
of comments and material received during this comment period.





Public Comments Solicited




The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All biological comments received by the date
specified above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan.




Authority





The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In No. 32133, Union Pacific Corporation, and its subsidiary railroads Union Pacific Railroad and Missouri Pacific
Railroad (collectively, UP), seek to acquire control of CNW and its corporate parent, Chicago and North Western Holdings
Corp. Notice of acceptance of the UP application was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 26, 1993, at 58 FR 11626. On November 29, 1993, pursuant to the Commission's revised procedural schedule
set forth in 

Union Pacific Corp., Et Al._Control_CNW, 

9 I.C.C.2d 939 (1993), the following responsive applications were filed: 




Finance Docket No. 32133 (Sub-No. 1). 

KCS seeks the imposition of the following protective conditions designed to ``renovate'' its current ``north end''
haulage rights over UP between Kansas City and Omaha, NE/Council Bluffs, IA, Lincoln, NE, Atchison, KS, and Topeka,
KS:

1

 



(1) A new, cost-based, haulage charge, based upon UP's current, actual costs, with periodic adjustments; 
(2) Elimination of all restrictions as to local service and interlining at Kansas City of traffic moving pursuant
to those haulage rights; 
(3) A guarantee by UP of ``most favored nation'' treatment being extended to KCS on all UP switching charges and practices
at Omaha/Council Bluffs; and (4) A guarantee by UP of minimum transit time, between the receipt or delivery of cars
for shipment under the haulage rights, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the interchange of those cars to KCS,
with penalty provisions for any default. 




KCS also seeks new haulage rights over CNW: 




(5) Haulage rights, convertible to trackage rights at KCS's option, over CNW lines between Council Bluffs and Sheldon,
IA; between Council Bluffs-Fort Dodge, IA, and the surrounding area; and between Kansas City, MO, and Des Moines,
IA; and certain related conditions. 






Finance Docket No. 32133 (Sub-No. 2). 

SP seeks denial of the application, but alternatively, requests the imposition of the following conditions: 




(1) Access by such trackage and haulage rights as would be most efficient in the circumstances to provide full service
to all shippers served by CNW and its existing affiliates (except those in Michigan and northeast Wisconsin). SP may
hold out service in its own name, and quote rates and contracts without the concurrence of CNW; CNW shall furnish the
underlying rail transportation as an independent contractor for mutually agreed upon compensation (or Commission
prescribed compensation in the event of a failure to agree); and CNW shall give such traffic equal handling and priority
as its own traffic; 
(2) Access by such trackage and haulage rights as would be most efficient in the circumstances (a) to serve origins
and destinations exclusively served by UP via Missouri Pacific Railroad (MP) and former Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad lines (MKT); and (b) to bridge between the CNW in the North and the SP in the South. SP may hold out service in
its own name, and quote rates and contracts without the concurrence of CNW; MP shall furnish the underlying rail transportation
as an independent contractor for mutually agreed upon compensation (or Commission prescribed compensation in the
event of a failure to agree); and MP shall give such traffic equal handling and priority as its own traffic; 
(3) Such changes in compensation, ownership and responsibility for maintenance, dispatch and other operations,
and terminal rights and access to certain intermediate points, as will permit efficient and effective competition
by SP utilizing the trackage rights granted in Finance Docket No. 30,000: (a) to SSW between Kansas City, MO, and East
St. Louis, IL; and (b) to DRGW between Pueblo, CO, and Kansas City. Such changes include various measures to insure
that SP trains are to be given equal treatment with UP trains; 
(4) Provisions designed to provide access to CNW facilities at the Chicago Switching District that will allow SP to
provide service and competition on terms and conditions no less favorable than those available to UP today, including
reciprocal switching; and 
(5) Access to and participation in each of the marketing and operational coordinations of the type described at pages
372-376 of Volume 1 of the Application, which are entered into by UP and CNW with each other subsequent to the effective
date of any control authority granted in this proceeding, on terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent
to the terms and conditions of UP's access or participation. 






Finance Docket No. 32133 (Sub-No. 3). 

CC&P and CCP Holdings request: 




(1) Overhead trackage rights for CC&P over UP's Council Bluffs Subdivision between the connection of CC&P's
rail line at CC&P milepost 512.2 (Council Bluffs, IA) and the KCS/Soo Line Joint Agency Yard and UPRR Neff Yard
in Kansas City, MO, and Kansas City, KS, with the right to interchange with all connecting carriers at Kansas City,
and to handle directly inbound movements of grain to all existing grain receivers located on UP and CNW at Kansas City;

(2) Overhead trackage rights over CNW's Sioux City Subdivision between the connection of CC&P's line with CNW's
line at CNW milepost 76.3 (Sioux City, IA) and the connection with CC&P's line at Council Bluffs, with the right
to directly handle inbound movements of soybeans and outbound movements of soybean meal, oil, and other soybean products
to and from the Ag Processing, Inc., plant located on CNW at Sergeant Bluff, IA; 
(3) Overhead trackage rights for CC&P over CNW's Fort Dodge Subdivision between the connection of CC&P's
line to CNW's line at CNW milepost 372.5 (Fort Dodge, IA) and milepost 354.2, at the private tracks of Ag Processing,
Inc., at Eagle Grove, IA, for the limited purpose of handling inbound shipments of soybeans and coal and outbound movements
of grain products to/from the Ag Processing, Inc., plant located on CNW at Eagle Grove, IA.

The applications substantially comply with the applicable regulations.

2

 The application and exhibits are available for inspection in the Public Docket Room at the offices of the Interstate
Commerce Commission in Washington, DC. In addition, they may be obtained upon request from applicant's representatives.





These applications are consolidated for disposition with the primary application in Finance Docket No. 32133. Service
of an initial decision will be waived, and determination of the merits of the applications will be made in the first
instance by the entire Commission. 49 U.S.C. 11345(f). 
Interested persons may participate formally by submitting written comments regarding all or any of the responsive
applications. Comments should indicate the exact proceeding designation, and should be filed with the correct number
of copies and with the Commission offices specified above no later than February 28, 1994. Comments shall include
the following: The person's position in support of or in opposition to the proposed transaction; any and all evidence,
including verified statements, in support of or in opposition to the proposed transaction; and specific reasons
why approval would or would not be in the public interest. See 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(1). Interested persons who do not intend
to participate formally in the proceeding but who desire to comment may file statements, subject to the filing and
service requirements specified below. Persons must state specifically whether they intend actively to participate
in the proceeding or whether they wish only to be advised of all decisions issued by the Commission. Failure to state
an intention to participate as an active party will result in the person being placed in the latter category. 
Written comments must be concurrently served by first class mail on the Secretary of the Department of Transportation,
on the Attorney General of the United States, and on all other persons designated as active parties of record on the
Commission's service list, including primary applicants' representatives. 
Rebuttal in support of these responsive applications must be filed by March 19, 1994. 
Because these applications contain proposed conditions to approval of the application in Finance Docket No. 32133,
the Commission will entertain no requests for affirmative relief related to these proposals. Parties may only participate
in direct support of or direct opposition to these applications as filed. 
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation. 


It is ordered: 
1. To the extent that applicants failed to submit certain financial evidence in the application filed in Finance Docket
No. 32133 (Sub-No. 2) as required by 49 CFR 1180.9, the requirements of that section are waived. 
2. The applications in Finance Docket No. 32133 (Sub-Nos. 1, 2, and 3) are accepted for consideration. 
3. The parties shall comply with all provisions as stated above.

 

Decided: December 21, 1993.

Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Resource Conservation Act and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act




In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in United
States 

v.

 Environmental Pacific Corp., 

Civil Action No. 91-771-AS was lodged on December 17, 1993, with the United States District Court for the
District of Oregon. The Consent Decree settles all claims with the two defendants, Environmental Pacific Corporation
(EPC) and Richard Hill.

The original complaint in this action was brought against EPC pursuant to Section 3008(h) of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6928(h), seeking an order that EPC perform corrective action at its facility in
Amity, Oregon to clean up hazardous constituents that had been released into the environment. EPC operated a hazardous
waste treatment, storage or disposal facility in Amity, where EPC handled primarily spent batteries, electroplating
wastewater treatment sludge, and other allegedly recyclable materials containing plastics and metals.


In an amended complaint, the United States added claims against EPC and Richard Hill, the President of EPC while the
company was in operation, pursuant to 40 CFR 268.50 for improper storage of F006 electroplating wastes and mercury,

<DOCTITLE>Controlled Substances; Established 1993 Aggregate Production Quotas</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule establishing 1993 aggregate production quotas.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The interim rule (58 FR 51382, October 1, 1993) which established 1993 revised aggregate production quotas for some
controlled substances in Schedules I and II, as required under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826)
is adopted without change.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act, (21 U.S.C. 826), requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration pursuant to  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.




On October 1, 1993, an interim rule establishing revised 1993 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances
in Schedules I and II was published in the 

Federal Register 

(58 FR 51382). One comment was received from a company supporting the use of the interim rule in establishing aggregate
production quotas under certain circumstances. The interim rule is adopted without change.

This rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.

These actions have been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

The Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interests
must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual aggregate
production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international commitments
of the United States. Such quotas impact predominantly upon major manufacturers of the affected controlled substance.

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the CSA of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826) and delegated
to the Administrator by  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Administrator of the DEA hereby
establishes the following revised 1993 aggregate production quotas for the listed controlled substances, expressed
in grams of anhydrous base:

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Company (North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2)</DOCTITLE>


Exemption


I


Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-4 and
NPF-7 which authorize operation of North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2 (NA-1&2, the facility)
at steady-state power levels not in excess of 2893 megawatts thermal. The licenses provide, among other things, that
the facility is subject to all the rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect.
The facility employs pressurized water reactors (PWRs) located at the licensee's site in Louisa County, Virginia.

The licensee is implementing a refurbishment and restoration program for the NA-1&2 service water system
(SWS). The program is being conducted in several stages. The subject Phase 1, Stage 4 is to be conducted for a period
of time beginning January 3, 1994 and ending October 13, 1994, and will be performed during dual unit operating conditions.
The scope of Stage 4 involves restoration of the two 24-inch auxiliary supply lines from Lake Anna to the main SW headers.
This consists of approximately 900 linear feet of piping (450 feet per line). Each 450-foot line consists of approximately
185 feet of direct buried piping, 230 feet of concrete-encased piping and 35 feet of exposed piping. To support the
Phase 1, Stage 4 SWS restoration program, the licensee has identified one temporary exemption required at this time.
The exemption is specified below.


II


The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criterion-2 (GDC-2) requires that:
Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena
such as * * * tornadoes, * * * without loss of capability to perform their safety functions.
The licensee has requested the temporary exemption from GDC-2 because of planned maintenance which will expose
portions of the SWS piping to the potential effects of postulated missiles generated by natural phenomena. Earth
and concrete protect the piping systems from the effects of severe weather events at the NA-1&2 site, such
as tornadoes, for conformance with the requirements of GDC-2. The excavation of the auxiliary service water
lines will affect only the missile shield protection aspects of GDC-2, with seismic qualification being retained.
While producing a minimal increase in missile interaction risk, excavation of the piping does not result in total
vulnerability to missiles. In the area of the planned excavation, the lines are substantially below grade and are
adjacent to the turbine building structure. This will prevent some lateral aspects of missile vulnerability.
The licensee is providing contingency measures with compensatory actions to provide added assurance of safe operation
of the facility during the exemption period. Although the exemption is requested only for missile protection, the
risk to the plant due to construction mishaps is more significant than the risk due to natural phenomena. Therefore,
the compensatory measures are geared toward preventing such mishaps in addition to minimizing the potential for
missiles generated by severe weather. As stated in the staff's Safety Evaluation dated December 27, 1993, these compensatory
actions include but are not limited to the following:
 Electronic scanning and nondestructive locating methods will be used to accurately determine underground
locations of piping, duct banks, and other buried utilities prior to excavation.
 Machine excavation will be limited to an elevation that does not pose a threat to the auxiliary service water
(ASW) lines. The remaining excavation will be performed by hand operated power and manual tools.
 Physical barriers will be used to keep vehicles a safe distance from the excavation site.
 Loose materials in and around the excavation will be limited to only those absolutely necessary for activities
in progress.
 Lifting and rigging components will be inspected and load tested. Lifting of equipment or construction materials
over the excavation will be performed with adequate precautions in accordance with approved procedures.

 Direct verbal communication (using dedicated radios if necessary) will be maintained between equipment
operators and supervisors/observers.
 Operable ASW lines will retain their seismic qualification.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940104-2-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 
Engineering reviews will be performed for shoring and temporary supports (if required) in the excavation area. 


 
Gasoline powered equipment will be refilled using small containers and the number of containers within the excavation
area will be restricted. This is in accordance with the existing station procedures. 


 
Worker training and shift briefings will be conducted for all aspects of the project. 


 
Severe weather procedures will be used to provide notification to clear the area of vehicles and loose materials in
the event of a tornado watch or other high wind conditions. 


 
Adequate wind protection and heating will be provided during freezing weather conditions. 




Considering the existing design features and compensatory measures proposed by the licensee, the likelihood of
damage to the exposed auxiliary SWS lines from postulated missiles generated by natural phenomena is minimal. Also,
based on the compensatory measures provided, assurance exists that the ability to bring the plant to a safe shutdown
will be maintained following any natural phenomena, including tornadoes or other severe weather which could result
in airborne missiles. Therefore, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed GDC-2 exemption will present
no undue risk to public health and safety. 




III





The Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), that special circumstances as set forth in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v).
The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation (GDC-2). The exemption is
requested for a specific time period after which the facility would again be in conformance with all the requirements
of GDC-2. The licensee has made good faith efforts in considering alternatives to the exemption requests and
has concluded that the Phase 1, Stage 4 SWS refurbishment and restoration program can only be conducted without the
subject exemption during a period when both NA-1&2 are shut down and defueled. The impact of scheduling
such a dual-unit outage would have significant consequences in terms of power supply, fuel storage, capacity, and
replacement power costs. Finally, the exemption will indirectly result in benefits to the public from increased
reliability of the upgraded safety-related SWS.



Based on the above and on review of the licensee's submittal, as summarized in the Safety Evaluation dated December
27, 1993, the NRC staff concludes that the likelihood of unacceptable damage to the exposed auxiliary SW lines due
to tornadoe-borne missiles during the exemption period is low. 



Based on the low probability of unacceptable events, coupled with the comprehensive compensatory measures which
the licensee has committed to, the NRC staff finds the proposed exemption from GEDC-2 acceptable. 




 IV





Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the subject exemption is authorized by
law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security.
The Commission further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), are present
justifying the exemption; namely, that the exemption would provide only temporary relief 





 from the applicable regulations and that the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulations.




Therefore, the Commission hereby approves the following exemption: NA-1&2 may operate without conforming
to the requirements of GDC-2 as they apply to the buried portions of the auxiliary SWS lines from Lake Anna to the
main SWS header providing that compensatory measures as described herein are continued for the period of the exemption.




Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting the above exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (October 7, 1993, 58 FR 52332).



The subject Phase 1, Stage 4 SWS GDC-2 exemption is effective from its date of issuance through October 14, 1994.







Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 27th day of December 1993.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice
of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to
Method for Execution of Cross Transactions</DOCTITLE>



December 28, 1993.






I. Introduction




On August 26, 1991, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change relating to the method for the execution of cross transactions on the PSE. On June 7, 1993, the
PSE submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify certain terms used in the original filing.
 On August 18, 1993, the PSE submitted Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify its interpretation
of certain provisions regarding specialist participation in cross transactions.












The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29712 (September 20, 1991),
56 FR 49217 (September 27, 1991). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule
change, including both amendments on an accelerated basis.






II. Description of the Proposal




Exchange Rule 5.14(b) outlines the traditional method for the execution of cross transactions on the PSE.
 Under that rule, a member effecting a cross transaction must first assure that all existing bids or offers by the specialists,
in the books or at the posts, at or better than the cross price, are filled at their limits.
 Thereafter the member must publicly announce both sides of the cross; the member's offer must be higher than his or
her bid by the minimum trading differential permitted for that security.
 Rule 5.14(b) then allows the member to execute the cross transaction at his or her bid or offer. Under this method, however,
another member can ``break up'' the cross by trading with either the bid or the offer side of the transaction when it
is presented to the crowd.










The Exchange proposes to formalize several policies that its Equity Floor Trading Committee previously developed
to encourage the execution of cross transactions on the PSE. Specifically, the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b)
will codify the PSE's policy that all efforts should be made to facilitate the execution of crosses; and will clarify
which orders a member must satisfy before he or she can execute such a transaction.
 The proposed commentary also will interpret Rule 5.14(b), together with the PSE's priority rule,
 to prohibit the specialist from participating in a cross to establish or increase his or her position,
 unless the member effecting the transactions gives the specialist permission to do so.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940104-2-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940104-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Exchange proposes to place additional restrictions on when a specialist can break up a cross transaction.
Thus under the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b), the specialist will be prohibited from participating, for the
benefit of his or her own account, on (1) either side of a customer-to-customer cross,
or (2) the customer side of a cross with the principal account of a member, where the cross is at a price inside the disseminated
PSE market. The PSE, however, will interpret this provision to allow a specialist who is willing to better the price
to participate in a cross transaction.
Finally, for purposes of Rule 5.14(b), the Exchange will define a ``customer order'' as an order that a broker represents
in an agency capacity, including a professional order that is not for an account associated with the executing broker.






The PSE believes that the proposed rule change maintains the auction at market principles of price improvement and
priority to existing orders, while at the same facilitating the execution of crosses on the PSE. In addition, the PSE
believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with policies recently adopted by other exchanges.
 The PSE states that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that these changes will
promote just and equitable principles of trade and will protect investors and the public interest by continuing the
effort to remove impediments to a free and open market.





III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of sections 6(b) and 11(a).
In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement
that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and with the section 6(b)(8)
requirement that the rules of an exchange not impose any unnecessary burden on competition. The Commission also believes
that the proposed rule change does not operate in a manner inconsistent with the traditional auction market principle
of customer priority, as embodied in section 11(a) of the Act.




After careful review, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should further competition among
the exchanges, as well as between exchanges and other markets, and should increase the opportunities for the efficient
execution of cross transactions. In the past, the Commission has recognized the competition that exists between
various markets for order flow, and especially for block business. Several exchanges recently have sought Commission
approval to amend their rules, on the grounds that exchange rules may hinder members' ability to execute a cross transaction
without interference and thus may place an exchange at a competitive disadvantage. Despite serious reservations,
the Commission has approved those proposals which are consistent with traditional auction market principles.

<TEXT>
 

In response to today's competitive market environment, the PSE has proposed to codify its policy that members should
make their best efforts not to interfere in another member's cross transaction and, in particular, that the specialist
should not participate unless he or she is liquidating a position. The PSE also has proposed to add a new requirement,
based on a comparable rule on the Phlx, that the specialist's proprietary bid or offer yield to the customer side of
a cross transaction at the cross price.
 Looking at the proposal as whole, the Commission believes that it will clarify the roles of various market participants
and assure that, under routine circumstances, crosses are executed in a fair and orderly manner. In sum, the Commission
finds that this proposed rule change should improve the PSE's ability to compete for block business and should enhance
the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.







In terms of auction market principles, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change strikes an appropriate
balance between the competing needs of various customer orders represented for execution on the PSE and the proprietary
trading operations of Exchange members and member organizations, including specialists. The Commission notes
that Rule 5.14(b) will continue to require that a member effecting a cross transaction first assure that all existing
bids or offers on the specialist's book or represented in the trading crowd, at or better than the cross price, are filled
at their limits.
 On that basis, the Commission has concluded that the PSE proposal adheres to the auction market principles of time
and price priority and that this method for the execution of crosses (and, in particular, the priority granted to the
customer side of the transaction) will not disadvantage existing orders.
 In fact, limit orders on the PSE which coincide with the cross price could benefit from being assured of receiving an
execution at that price. 






Furthermore, the Commission finds that the PSE proposal does not restrict the opportunity for customer orders to
receive price improvement. To this end, the Commission interprets the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b), and the
Exchange agrees with that interpretation,
 to allow the specialist to participate in a cross transaction to provide one side with a better price, notwithstanding
the other provisions of this rule.
 In addition, under the PSE's method, it is possible for interest in the trading crowd, including an order for the principal
account of a member, to break up the cross and to improve the price.






Finally, the Commission believes that the PSE proposal would not grant priority, parity or precedence to the order
of a member in a manner inconsistent with section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act or SEC Rule 11a1-1(T)(a)(3) thereunder.
 For purposes of its proposed rule change, the PSE has defined the term ``customer order'' as an order that a broker represents
in an agency capacity, including a professional order that is not for an account associated with the executing broker.
Because this definition of ``customer order'' excludes (and, thus, does not grant priority to) an order for an account
over which the broker or an associated person of the broker exercises investment discretion, the Commission is satisfied
that the proposed rule change complies with section 11(a).





The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 merely clarify certain language used in the original
filing and make no substantive changes to the proposed rule. Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments
on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full statutory period.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Continental Homes Holding
Corp., Common Stock, $.01 Par Value) File No. 1-10700</DOCTITLE>



December 28, 1993.



Continental Homes Holding Corp. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 15,
1993 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for its common stock.

Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>NBD Bank, N.A. et al.; Application</DOCTITLE>



December 27, 1993.




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for permanent order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

NBD Bank, N.A. (``NBD''), NBD Bank, and NBD Bancorp, Inc.




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Permanent order requested under 9(c) for an exemption from the provisions of section 9(a).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

On December 17, 1993, the Commission issued a conditional temporary order and notice of application for permanent
order under section 9(c) of the Act exempting applicants from the disqualification provisions of section 9(a) solely
with respect to a securities-related injunction entered against NBD.
 Applicants have discovered that the application, and consequently the notice, contains a factual misstatement
with respect to the composition of the board of trustees of the Woodward Funds and Renaissance Assets Trust. Applicants
have filed an amended application to correct the misstatement.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. NBD is a national banking association and a wholly-owned subsidiary of NBD Bancorp, Inc. NBD serves as investment
adviser to The Woodward Funds and Renaissance Assets Trust (the ``Funds''). The Funds are open-end management investment
companies registered under the Act. The Woodward Funds consist of thirteen separate portfolios: Woodward Growth/Value
Fund; Woodward Opportunity Fund; Woodward Intrinsic Value Fund; Woodward Equity Index Fund; Woodward Intermediate
Bond Fund; Woodward Bond Fund; Woodward Money Market Fund; Woodward Government Fund; Woodward Treasury Money Market
Fund; Woodward Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund; Woodward Michigan Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund; Woodward Municipal
Bond Fund; and Woodward Michigan Municipal Bond Fund. It is anticipated that additional portfolios will commence
operation at calendar year-end 1993 or shortly thereafter. Renaissance Assets Trust consists of two separate portfolios:
the Renaissance Government Fund and the Renaissance Money Market Fund.

2. NBD Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NBD Illinois, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NBD Bancorp.
NBD Bank is not currently an investment adviser to any registered investment company. NBD Bank has entered into an
agreement to act as sub-investment adviser to the Separate Account I (the ``Separate Account'') of the Washington
National Life Insurance Company (``Washington National'').

3. NBD Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company incorporated under Delaware law.

4. On December 17, 1993, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York in a civil action entitled 

Securities and Exchange Commission 

v. 

Comerica Bank

 (the ``SEC'' Action''). The complaint alleged that NBD violated Regulation U, as promulgated by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System under section 7(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in connection with extensions
of credit in a custodial trust account maintained for an individual named Mark Sendo.

5. On the same day, NBD consented to the entry of a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (the ``Final
Judgment''), without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commission's complaint except as to jurisdiction.
The Final Judgment enjoins NBD from further violations of Regulation U. The Final Judgment requires that NBD disgorge
$2,500, which represents its gross custodian services fees earned on Sendo's accounts. In addition, the Final Judgment
requires NBD to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000. The Final Judgment also requires NBD to adopt internal procedures
designed to prevent a recurrence of the violative conduct.

6. Applicants have been advised by the trustees of the Funds and by Washington National that (a) the trustees of the
Funds and the directors of Washington National have reviewed the circumstances pertinent to the Final Judgment,
and, in the case of the Funds, have considered the prior services rendered to the Funds by NBD; and (b) after review and
consideration of such factors as they deemed appropriate, a majority of the trustees of the Woodward Funds who are
not interested persons with respect to applicants, a majority of the trustees of Renaissance Assets Trust who are
not interested persons with respect to applicants, and the directors of Washington National have determined that
the retention of NBD in the case of the Funds and of NBD Bank in the case of Washington National as investment adviser
is in the best interests of the Funds' shareholders and the account holders of the Separate Account.
7. In making the application, applicants acknowledge, understand, and agree that the application and any temporary
exemption issued by the Commission shall be without prejudice to the Commission's consideration of any application
for exemptions from statutory requirements, including the consideration of the instant application for a permanent
exemption pursuant to section 9(c) or the revocation or removal of any temporary exemption granted in connection
with the application.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants seek a permanent order exempting applicants and their affiliates from the provisions of section 9(a)
of the Act solely with respect to the Final Judgment.
2. Section 9(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, disqualifies any person or company from serving or acting in the capacity
of employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor of any registered
investment company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company, registered unit investment
trust, or registered face amount certificate company if such person, or an affiliated person of such person, has,
by reason of misconduct, been permanently or temporarily enjoined by an order, judgment, or decree from any court
of competent jurisdiction from acting as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or from engaging
in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security.3. Section 9(c) provides that the Commission shall grant an application for an exemption from
the disqualification provisions of section 9(a), either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporary or other
conditional basis, if it is established that these provisions, as applied to the applicant, are unduly or disproportionately
severe or that the conduct of the applicant has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection
of investors to grant such application.4. As a result of the Final Judgment, NBD and its affiliated persons are subject
to the disqualification provisions of section 9(a). Applicants assert that the application of such provisions to
applicants is unduly and disproportionately severe. Applicants further assert that NBD's conduct has been such
as not to make it against the public interest or protection of investors to grant the requested relief.

5. Applicants state that the conduct that gave rise to the Final Judgment was not in any way related to activities of
applicants as investment advisers. Applicants further state that neither applicants' senior management nor anyone
involved in the management of investment advisory services on applicants' behalf were involved in the activities
giving rise to the SEC Action.

6. Applicants assert that denial of the requested order would cause irreparable injury to applicants and to the Funds'
investors because the investors would no longer have the services of their investment adviser. In addition, investors
could be harmed by the uncertainty caused by applicants being prohibited from serving as investment advisers to the
Funds.

7. NBD has implemented policies and procedures designed to prevent a recurrence by other account holders of the type
of conduct that gave rise to the SEC Action. In addition, pursuant to the Final Judgment, NBD has taken or will take the
following steps to remedy its conduct and prevent the recurrence of violations:

a. NBD will maintain policies and procedures to ensure that it complies with Regulation U, including policies to ensure
that purchases of securities in custodial accounts are not paid for with proceeds from sales of the same securities
in the accounts.

b. Within thirty days after the entry of the Final Judgment, NBD will retain an independent consultant who will review
NBD's custodial securities clearing operations and who will make such recommendations as are necessary with respect
to NBD's policies and procedures to ensure that NBD complies with Regulation U.

c. The consultant will issue a report within sixty days of its retention setting forth its findings and recommendations
and will forward the report to the New York Regional Office.
 Unless the Commission objects to the consultant's recommendations within thirty days, applicants will implement
the consultant's recommendations by no later than forty days after the end of the period for the Commission to object.





8. Applicants state that they have not been the subject of prior Commission enforcement proceedings, and have not
previously filed an application for relief pursuant to section 9(c) of the Act.



Applicants' Condition



Applicants agree that any order granted by the Commission pursuant to the application will be subject to the condition
that NBD will comply with the Final Judgment.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Odetics, Inc., Class A Common
Stock, $0.10 Par Value; Class B Common Stock, $0.10 Par Value) File No. 1-8762</DOCTITLE>


December 28, 1993.



Odetics, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on November 18,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common
Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS'').
According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief
that listing of the Class A and Class B Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the
present listing on the Amex because:

(1) The Company believes that the liquidity may be improved through the multiple market maker system; and

(2) The Company believes that the visibility and possibly research coverage may increase with improved liquidity.

Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

File No. 1-10694</DOCTITLE>



December 28, 1993.



VISX, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'')


The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:


According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on October 13,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According
to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:


(1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility
and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist assigned to the stock on
the Amex; 

(2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's stockholders more liquidity than is
presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight; 

(3) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group
of market-makers and, in doing so, expand the capital base available for trading in its Common Stock; and 

(4) The Company believes that firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS system will be inclined
to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional
research and advisory reports. 

Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application

<DOCTITLE>Disease Not Associated With Exposure to Certain Herbicide Agents</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As required by law, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hereby gives notice that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,
under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of 1991, has determined that a presumption of service connection
based on exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era is not warranted for the following
conditions: Prostate cancer, peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive
cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm parameters and infertility, cognitive and
neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic and digestive disorders, immune system
disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung cancer), nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer,
skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, bladder cancer, brain tumors, and any other condition for which the Secretary
has not specifically determined a presumption of service connection is warranted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 3 of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102-4, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), directed the Secretary to enter
into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association
between exposure to herbicides used in support of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent
possible, (1) whether there is a statistical association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking
into account the strength of the scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association;
(2) the increased risk of disease among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam
during the Vietnam era; and (3) whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship
between herbicide exposure and the suspect disease.


Section 2 of Public Law 102-4 provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific
evidence, that a positive association (i.e., the credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the
credible evidence against the association) exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical
in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during
the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection
for that disease. If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, he will publish
a notice of that determination, which includes an explanation of the scientific basis for that determination.
Although Public Law 102-4 does not define ``credible'', it does instruct the Secretary to ``take into consideration
whether the results are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review.'' Simply
comparing the number of studies which report a positive relative risk to the number of studies which report a negative
relative risk for a particular condition is not a valid method for determining whether the weight of evidence overall
supports a finding that there is or is not a positive association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development
of the particular condition. Because of differences in statistical significance, confidence levels, control for
confounding factors, etc., some studies are clearly more credible than others, and the Secretary has given them more
weight in evaluating the overall credibility of the evidence concerning specific diseases.
After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and selecting approximately 230
epidemiologic studies for detailed analysis, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings,
NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July
27, 1993. The Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association exists between exposure
to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea
tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 50528-30). The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings
in the NAS report to determine whether a positive association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions.
That review has been completed and this notice, pursuant to Public Law 102-4, conveys the Secretary's determination
that there is no positive association between herbicide exposure and prostate cancer, peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary
cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm
parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic
and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung
cancer), nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer, skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, bladder cancer, brain tumors, and
any other condition for which the Secretary has not specifically determined a presumption of service connection
is warranted.

The NAS report assigns prostate cancer to a category labeled limited/suggestive evidence of an association, which
it defined as meaning there is evidence suggestive of an association between herbicide exposure and a particular
health outcome, but that evidence is limited because chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence.
Prostate cancer is a very common male genitourinary cancer which shows marked increased prevalence with age. There
are statistically significant occupational studies which show no association between prostate cancer and herbicide
exposure (e.g., Fingerhut M.A., Halperin W.E., Marlow D.A., Piacitelli L.A., Honchar P.A., Sweeney M.H., Greife
A.L., Dill P.A., Steenland K., Suruda A.J. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
New England Journal of Medicine 324:212-218; Manz A., Berger J., Dwyer J.H., Flesch-Janys D., Nagel S., Waltsgott
H. 1991. Cancer mortality among workers in chemical plant contaminated with dioxin. Lancet 338:959-964; Saracci
R., Kogevinas M., Bertazzi P.A., Bueno De Mesquita B.H., Coggon D., Green L.M., Kauppinen T., L'Abbe K.A., Littorin
M., Lynge E., Mathews J.D., Neuberger M., Osman J., Pearce N., Winkelman R. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed
to chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorophenois. Lancet 338:1027-1032). Some occupational studies have shown
a slight elevated risk for prostate cancer among farm and forestry workers (e.g., Burmeister L.F., 1981. Cancer mortality
in Iowa farmers: 1971-1978. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 66:461-464; Alavanja M.C., Merkle
S., Teske J. Eaton B., Reed B. 1989. Mortality among forest and soil conservationists. Archives of Environmental
Health 44:94-101); however, only one study concerning a small sub-set of farmers (Morrison H., Savitz, D.,
Semenciw R., Hulka B., Mao Y., Morison D., Wigle D. 1993. Farming and prostate cancer mortality. American Journal
of Epidemiology 137:270-280) associated the increased risk of prostate cancer among farmers specifically
with herbicide exposure. The Morrison study is so recent that it it too early to determine whether its results will
be replicated by other research. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association
between prostate cancer and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has
determined that a positive association does not exist. 


The NAS report assigns peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers,
renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric
disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory
disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung cancer), and nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer to a category labeled
inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists, which is defined as meaning that
the available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency, or statistical strength to permit a conclusion
regarding the presence or absence of an association with herbicide exposure. 

Peripheral neuropathy can be induced by many common medical and environmental disorders unrelated to herbicide
exposure, such as aging, alcoholism, diabetes, and exposure to other toxic chemicals. The last time VA considered
this issue, it determined, after receiving the advice of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards,
that there was sufficient evidence to meet the requirements for a ``significant statistical association,'' the
standard in effect at that time, between exposure to herbicides containing dioxin and the subsequent development
of peripheral neuropathy under certain circumstances (See 57 FR 2236-38). That conclusion, however, relied
heavily on case reports, which are anecdotal and have no statistical significant, and occupational studies such
as Singer and colleagues (1982) (Singer R., Moses M., Valciukas J., Lilis R., Selikoff I.J., 1982. Nerve conduction
velocity studies of workers employed in the manufacture of phenoxy herbicides. Environmental Research 29:297-311)
whose credibility is compromised because they did not apply consistent methods to define a comparison group, determine
exposure, evaluate clinical deficits, use standard definitions of peripheral neuropathy, or eliminate confounding
variables. The Singer study, for example, excluded individuals with excessive alcohol consumption from the controls
but not from the subjects of the study. Other occupational studies, such as Suskind and Herzberg (1984) (Suskind R.R.,
Hertzberg V.S., 1984. Human health effects of 2,4,5-T and its toxic contaminants. Journal of the American Medical
Association 251:2372-2380), which did not have those methodological problems, showed no difference in the
incidence of peripheral neuropathy for workers exposed to herbicides and workers not so exposed. Accordingly, the
Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between peripheral neuropathy and herbicide
exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association
does not exist.

Hepatobiliary cancers are cancers of the liver and bile duct. There are a variety of risk factors that should be considered
by a credible study, including hepatitis B and C, alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl
(PCB), and smoking. The relevant studies are few, and have not adequately controlled for these risk factors. A Swedish
case control study (Hardell L., Bengtsson N.O., Jonsson U., Eriksson S., Larsson L.G., 1984. Aetiological aspects
on primary liver cancer with special regard to alcohol, organic solvents and acute intermittent porphyria: an epidemiological
investigation. British Journal of Cancer 50:389-397) showed a relationship between herbicide exposure and
the subsequent development of hepatobiliary cancer; however, other studies of similar size (Ronco G, Costa G., Lynge
E., 1992. Cancer risk among Danish and Italian farmers. British Journal of Industrial Medicine 49:220-225;
Wiklund K., 1983. Swedish agricultural workers: a group with a decreased risk of cancer. Cancer 51:566-568)
indicated no relationship. A large occupational study (Fingerhut et al., 1991) and a study of farmers in Denmark and
Italy (Ronco et al., 1992) found no relationship. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence
against an association between hepatobiliary cancer and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for
such an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.

Bone cancers were considered together with joint cancers by NAS. Because of the rarity of bone cancers, most studies
have been too small to detect a significant risk. There has not been a consistent finding of bone cancer in exposed groups;
the preponderance of studies show no association, and the few studies that demonstrate a positive relationship (Fingerhut
et al., 1991; Breslin P., Kang H., Lee y., Burt V., Shepard B.M., 1988. Proportionate mortality study of U.S. Army and
U.S. Marine Corps veterans of the Vietnam War. Journal of Occupational Medicine 30:412-419) are small and have
large confidence intervals which include one. The small size of the studies and the confidence limitations compromise
their significance. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between
bone cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined
that a positive association does not exist.

Female reproductive cancers reviewed by NAS include those of the breast, uterus, cervix, ovary, and other genital
malignancies. The data related to women and herbicide exposure is extremely limited because few of the studies included
women. A large number of the breast cancer studies showed no association. Two studies (Thomas T.L., Kang H., Dalager
N., 1991. Mortality among women Vietnam veterans, 1973-1987. American Journal of Epidemiology 134:973-980;
Manz et al., 1991) showed an increased risk for breast cancer which was not significant since both studies failed to
control for reproductive histories and had methodological problems. Only one small case control study (Donna A.,
Betta P-G., Robutti F., Crosignani P., Berrino F., Bellingeri D., 1984. Ovarian mesothelial tumors and herbicides:
a case control study. Carcinogenesis 5:941-942) showed an association with ovarian cancer, but the confidence
intervals were very wide. The larger occupational and farm worker studies all showed significantly lower mortality
ratios than expected. Likewise, studies of exposures generally found less uterine and cervical cancer than expected.
Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between female reproductive
cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that
a positive association does not exist.

The leather industry, asbestos, cadmium, petroleum products, analgesics, smoking, and obesity have been associated
with renal cancers. Studies of renal cancer have generally produced inconclusive results, in some cases because
of failure to adequately control for these confounding factors. Only one study of agricultural and forest workers
(Alavanja et al., 1989) showed a significantly increased risk of death from renal cancers; however, the preponderance
of studies, including the two largest (Wiklund, 1983; Burmeister, 1981), showed either no relationship with renal
cancers or increased risk which was not significant. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence
against an association between renal cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an
association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.

Major risk factors for testicular cancer are undescended testis and other factors, such as genetic abnormalities,
infections, etc., which produce atrophy and dysfunction. In general, occupational studies (Ronco et al., 1992;
Wiklund, 1983) have shown no association between herbicide exposure and testicular cancer. Occupational and environmental
studies have found either no association or increased risk which was not significant. Studies concerning Vietnam
veterans were inconsistent, and in those that found increased risk, that risk was generally not significant. Accordingly,
the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between testicular cancer and herbicide
exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association
does not exist.
Potential evidence for an association between herbicide exposure and leukemia comes primarily from studies of farmers
(Ronco et al., 1992; Wigle D.T., Semenciw R.B., Wilkins K., Riedel D., Ritter L., Morrison H.I., Mao Y., 1990. Mortality
study of Canadian male farm operators: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality and agricultural practices in Saskatchewan.
Journal of the National Cancer Institute 82:575-582) and residents of Seveso, Italy (Bertazzi P.A., Zocchetti
C., Pesatori A.C., Guercilena S., Sanarico M., Radice L., 1989b. Ten-year mortality study of the population involved
in the Seveso incident in 1976. American Journal of Epidemiology 129:1187-1200; Bertazzi P.A., Zocchetti
C., Pesatori A.C., Guercilena S., Consonni D., Tironi A., Landi M.T., 1992. Mortality of a young population after
accidental exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin. International Journal of Epidemiology 21:118-123).
The studies of farmers did not control for other confounding exposures (Brownson R.C., Reif J.S., Chang J.C., Davis
J.R., 1989. Cancer risk among Missouri farmers. Cancer 64:2381-2385.; Brown L.M., Blair A., Gibson R., Everett
G.D., Cantor K.P., Schuman L.M., Burmeister L.F., Van Lier S.F., Dick F. 1990. Pesticide exposures and other agricultural
risk factors for leukemia among men in Iowa and Minnesota. Cancer Research 50:6585-6591). When farmers were
stratified by suspected herbicide exposure, the incidence of leukemia was generally not elevated. Any elevation
appeared to be due to factors other than herbicide exposure, e.g., risk was higher among chicken farmers than wheat
farmers (Alavanja M.C., Blair A, Merkle S., Teske J. Eaton B., 1988. Mortality among agricultural extension agents.
American Journal of Industrial Medicine 14:167-176). The suggestive evidence of increased risk concerning
Seveso, Italy was not significant because of the small number of actual cases in which leukemia was found. Since none
of the studies demonstrated a dose-response for any subtype of leukemia, it is not possible to attribute leukemia
to herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between
leukemia and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that
a positive association does not exist.
The common parameters used to evaluate toxic effects to sperm are number, motility, structure, and morphology. Many
chemicals have been implicated in interfering with motility and sperm structure (Wyrobek A.J., Gordon L.A., Burkhart
J.G., Francis M.W., Kapp R.W., Letz G., Malling H.V., Topham J.C., Whorton M.D., 1983. An evaluation of human sperm
as indicators of chemically induced alterations of spermatogenic function. A report of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency Gene-Tox Program. Mutation Research 115:73-148). One occupational study (Lerda D., Rizzi R., 1991.
Study of reproductive function in persons occupationally exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).
Mutation Research 262:47-50) and one study of Vietnam veterans (Air Force Health Study (AFHS), 1992. An Epidemiologic
Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following Exposure to Herbicides. Reproductive Outcomes.
Brooks AFB: USAF School of Aerospace Medicine. AL-TR-992-0900 602 pp.) found no association with
decreased sperm count. Another study of Vietnam veterans (Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 1989. Comparison of
Serum Levels of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin with Indirect Estimates of Agent Orange Exposure Among Vietnam
Veterans: Final Report. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) found lower sperm concentration
and reduced sperm motility, but suggested these outcomes may be associated with the Vietnam experience rather than
exposure to herbicides. Infertility usually incorporates two concepts: the inability to conceive and the inability
to produce live children. Most studies do not take into account the desire for children, contraceptive practices,
and other factors influencing fertility. NAS found no occupational or environmental studies examining herbicide
exposure and infertility, and veteran studies (Field B., Kerr C., 1988. Reproductive behavior and consistent patterns
of abnormality in offspring of Vietnam veterans. Journal of Medical Genetics 25:819-826; AFHS, 1992; Centers
for Disease Control (CDC), 1988. Health status of Vietnam veterans. III. Reproductive outcomes and child health.
Journal of the American Medical Association 259:2715-2717) do not support an association between herbicide
exposure and infertility. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association
between abnormal sperm parameters and infertility and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such
an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.

Studies of cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders are beset by a number of methodologic problems, including exposure
measures, the wide variety of ``standardized'' test instruments used, and the inability to detect or correct for
other influences on test results such as emotional state, non-neurologic disease, metabolic conditions, fatigue,
medications, or style of the examiner. Because of their failure to adequately control for these confounding factors,
these studies lack credibility in assessing the relationship of herbicide exposure to these conditions. Accordingly,
the Secretary has found that there is no credible evidence for an association between cognitive and neuropsychiatric
disorders and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
There were no significant studies available to analyze whether an association exists between herbicide exposure
and motor/coordination dysfunction. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that there is no credible evidence for
an association between motor/coordination dysfunction and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive
association does not exist.
Metabolic and digestive disorders (diabetes mellitus, hepatic enzyme abnormality, lipid abnormalities, and ulcers)
were also categorized by NAS as health outcomes with inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association
exists. Although NAS found no biologic basis to suspect an association between herbicide exposure and diabetes,
abnormal glucose tolerance tests have been reported in three studies (Sweeney M.H., Fingerhut M.A., Arezzo J.C.,
Hornung R.W., Connally L.B. In press. Peripheral neuropathy after occupational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD).; Air Force Health Study. 1991. An Epidemiologic Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following
Exposure to Herbicides. Serum Dioxin Analysis of 1987 Examination Results. Brooks AFB, TX: USAF School of Aerospace
Medicine. 9 vols.; Pazderova-Vejlupkova J., Lukas E., Nemcova M., Pickova J., Jirasek L., 1991. The development
and prognosis of chronic intoxication by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in men. Archives of Environmental Health
36:5-11). While this suggests such an association, the evidence is inconclusive and its credibility is questionable
because an abnormal glucose tolerance test is not an absolute indicator of diabetes and none of these studies allowed
for the confounding role of obesity. Two other studies found no association (Moses M., Lilis R., Crow K.D., Thornton
J., Fischbein A., Anderson H.A., Selikoff I.J., 1984. Health status of workers with past exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
in the manufacture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid: Comparison of findings with and without chloracne. American
Journal of Industrial Medicine 5:161-182; Suskind and Hertzberg, 1984), and a number of studies have shown
no increased death rates from diabetes (Bertazzi et al., 1989; Cook R.R., Bond G.G., Olson R.A., Ott M.G., 1987. Update
of the mortality experience of workers exposed to chlorinated dioxins. Chemosphere 16:2111-2116; Henneberger
P.K., Ferris B.G. Jr., Monson R.R., 1989. Mortality among pulp and paper workers in Berlin, New Hampshire. British
Journal of Industrial Medicine 46:658-664). Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence
against an association between diabetes and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association,
and he has determined that a positive associations does not exist.

The studies related to hepatic enzyme abnormality did not demonstrate an association with liver disease, and confounding
factors (alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and other toxic chemicals) were not ruled out. Studies showing lipid
abnormalities do not control for the confounding variables of obesity and genetic factors, and no medical significance
of the modest and variable increases has been demonstrated. The risk of gastric ulcers in exposed populations has
not been sufficiently studied to establish an association with herbicide exposure. Only one study (Suskind and Hertzberg,
1984) indicates any increase, and in that study it is difficult to rule out the many factors (e.g., alcoholism, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, and H. pylori infection) known to be associated with ulcers. Accordingly, the Secretary
has found that there is no credible evidence for an association between metabolic and digestive disorders (other
than diabetes) and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
The available data deal with two categories of immune system disorders: immune modulation and autoimmunity. Many
immune parameters have been studied; however, few show a relationship to herbicide exposure. Most studies address
such a wide range of immune parameters that it is likely that at least some of the positive results are due to chance alone,
which undermines the credibility of those studies. Furthermore, the clinical meaning, i.e., the relationship of
immune disorders to disease, is unclear. Other studies (e.g., Pocchiari F., Silano V., Zampieri A., 1979. Human health
effects from accidental release of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at Seveso, Italy. Annals of the New York
Academy of Sciences 320:311-320; Ghezzi I., Cannatelli P., Assennato G., Merlo F., Mocarelli P., Brambilla
P., Sicurello F., 1982. Potential 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure of Seveso decontamination workers.
A controlled prospective study. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health 8:176-179) found no
relationship between immune system disorders and herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that
the credible evidence against an association between immune system disorders and herbicide exposure outweighs
the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
Most occupational studies concerning circulatory disorders (e.g., Moses et al., 1984; Suskind and Hertzberg, 1984)
showed no increased mortality or morbidity from circulatory disorders after herbicide exposure. The studies of
the residents of Seveso, Italy (Bertazzi, P.A., Zocchetti C., Pesatori A.C., Guercilena S., Sanarico M., Radice
L., 1989a. Mortality in an area contaminated by TCDD following an industrial incident. Medicina Del Lavoro 80:316-329;
Bertazzi et al., 1989b) showed some increased risk of mortality in the first five year follow-up; however, these studies
had a number of technical problems: they were not specific to circulatory disease and did not control for the confounding
variables of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Veteran studies (e.g., CDC, 1988) have suggested that any increase
in heart disease may be associated with the Vietnam experience rather than herbicide exposure, and most of these studies
did not adjust for confounding variables. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against
an association between circulatory diseases and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an
association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
NAS examined studies that covered a wide variety of respiratory disorders (e.g., chronic bronchitis, asthma, pleurisy,
pneumonia, and tuberculosis), other than respiratory cancer. Studies of individuals exposed in occupational settings
revealed no increase in mortality from respiratory disease (Coggon D., Pannett B., Winter P., 1991. Mortality and
incidence of cancer at four factories making phenoxy herbicides. British Journal of Industrial Medicine 48:173-178;
Blair A., 1983. Lung cancer and other causes of death among licensed pesticide applicators. Journal of the National
Cancer Institute 71:31-37; Alavanja et al., 1989; Coggon D., Pannett B., Winter P.D., Acheson E.D., Bonsall
J., 1986. Mortality of workers exposed to 2-methyl_chlorophenoxyacetic acid. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment,
and Health 12:448-454). Environmental exposure studies similarly showed no significant differences in mortality
due to respiratory disease (Bertazzi et al., 1989a,b). Also, mortality studies of Vietnam veterans generally found
no increased risk.

Morbidity data are generally difficult to evaluate because of methodological problems and because studies focused
on symptoms, lung function tests and x-ray interpretation rather than disease (e.g., Calvert et al., 1991; Pollei
S., Mettler F.A. Jr., Kelsey C.A., Walters M.R., White R.E., 1986. Follow-up chest radiographs in Vietnam veterans:
Are they useful? Radiology 161:101-102). One occupational study (Calvert G.M., Sweeney M.H., Morris J.A.,
Fingerhut M.A., Hornung R.W., Halperin W.E., 1991. Evaluation of chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and ventilatory function among workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. American Review
of Respiratory Disease 144:1302-1306) showed no excess morbidity; another occupational study (Suskind and
Hertzberg, 1984) found increased symptomatology of respiratory disease, but did not adequately control for the
confounding factor of age. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association
between respiratory disorders and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association,
and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
NAS noted an association between nasal cancers and occupational exposure to nickel and to chromates. Exposure to
wood dust is also a risk factor for nasal cancers; smoking and exposure to formaldehyde may increase the risk associated
with wood dust. There is also evidence that leather workers have an increased risk for nasal cancers, and that there
is an association between chronic nasal diseases and consumption of salt-preserved foods. Most studies (e.g., Wiklund,
1983; Ronco et al., 1992) showed inconclusive results, and often did not control for confounding variables. Two other
epidemiological studies based on the same three cases (Saracci et al., 1991; Coggon D., Pannett B., Winter P.D., Acheson
E.D., Bonsall J., 1986. Mortality of workers exposed to 2 methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid. Scandinavian Journal
of Work, Environment, and Health 12:448-454) and one case-control study (Hardell L., Johansson B., Axelson
O., 1982. Epidemiological study of nasal and nasopharyngeal cancer and their relation to phenoxy acid or chlorophenol
exposure. American Journal of Industrial Medicine 3:247-257) showed increased risk associated with herbicide
exposure; however, that risk was not statistically significant, which diminishes the importance of these studies.
Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between nasal/nasopharyngeal
cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that
a positive association does not exist.
NAS also reviewed the literature with respect to possible associations between herbicide exposure and various reproductive
effects, i.e., spontaneous abortion, birth defects, neonatal infant deaths and stillbirths, low birth weight,
and childhood cancers in offspring. These reproductive effects were categorized by NAS as health outcomes with inadequate/insufficient
evidence to determine whether an association exists because the studies were of inadequate statistical power for
specific birth defects, contained a limited sample size, and/or failed to exclude bias and chance. It should be noted
that to compensate a veteran for these conditions is beyond VA's authority (See title 38, U.S.C.) and would require
enabling legislation.
NAS assigns four diseases or categories of diseases to a category labeled limited/suggestive evidence of no association
with herbicide exposure which it defined as meaning that several adequate studies, covering the full range of levels
of exposure that humans are known to encounter, are mutually consistent in not showing a positive association between
herbicide exposure and the particular health outcome at any level of exposure. The conditions include skin cancer,
gastrointestinal tumors (stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer), bladder cancer,
and brain tumors. There were many credible studies (See NAS Report, Chapter 8) concerning all of these conditions
that showed no association or a negative association with herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has found
that there is no credible evidence for an association between skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors (stomach cancer,
pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer), bladder cancer, and brain tumors and herbicide exposure, and
he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
NAS reviewed approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles as an integral part of the process that
resulted in its report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam.'' From
these articles, approximately 230 epidemiologic studies, including studies of people exposed to herbicides in
occupational and environmental settings as well as studies of Vietnam veterans, were chosen for detailed review
and analysis. In our judgment, the comprehensive review and evaluation of the available literature which NAS conducted
in conjunction with its report has permitted us to identify all conditions for which the current body of knowledge
supports a finding of an association with herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined that there
is no positive association between exposure to herbicides and any other condition for which he has not specifically
determined that a presumption of service connection is warranted.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of funds.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), U.S. Department of Commerce, announces
that applications are available for planning and construction grants for public telecommunications facilities
under the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP), which is administered by NTIA.





Applicants for grants under the PTFP must file their applications on or before March 17, 1994. 

NTIA anticipates making grant awards by September 30, 1994.

Approximately $21.3 million is available in fiscal year 1994 for grants. The amount of a grant award will vary depending
on the project of the applicant. NTIA awarded $20.8 million in funds to 105 projects for fiscal year 1993. The awards
ranged from $1,898 to $968,989.

Final Rules and Policy Statement for the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program were published on November
22, 1991 (56 FR 59168-59192, No. 226). These rules, codified at 15 CFR part 2301, will be in effect for 1994 applications.

Prospective PTFP applicants should be aware that NTIA is in the process of establishing a new National Information
Infrastructure grant program to be called the Information Infrastructure Grants Program (IIGP). The IIGP's funds
may be used for the planning and construction of telecommunications networks or the purchase of telecommunications
services and facilities for the provision of educational, cultural, health care, public information, public safety
or other social services. The Congress appropriated $26 million dollars for the IIGP in FY 1994. Formal announcement
of the IIGP will be made at a later date. The new IIGP is separate from the already-existing grant program, the PTFP,
which is the subject of this Notice. The PTFP or its predecessor-agencies have been in operation since 1962; the present
PTFP program has been in place since 1978.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

(5) A state or local government or agency, or a political or special purpose subdivision of a state.
B. To be eligible to apply for and receive a planning grant, an applicant must be:
(1) Any of the organizations described in paragraph A of this section; or,
(2) A nonprofit foundation, corporation, institution, or association organized for any purpose except primarily
religious.
C. An applicant that is eligible under paragraphs A or B of this section may file an application with the Agency for a
planning or construction grant to achieve the following:
(1) The provision of new public telecommunications facilities to extend service to areas currently not receiving
public telecommunications services;
(2) The expansion of the service areas of existing public telecommunications entities;
(3) The establishment of new public telecommunications entities serving areas currently receiving public telecommunications
services; or,
(4) The improvement of the capabilities of existing licensed public broadcast stations to provide public telecommunications
services.
D. Applicants must certify whether they are delinquent on any Federal debt. No award of Federal funds shall be made
to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either:
(1) The delinquent account is paid in full,
(2) A negotiated repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or
(3) Other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made. Delinquent accounts include debts incurred
by sub-units of the applicant other than the sub-unit that is applying to NTIA, and includes debts owed to any agency
of the Federal government, not just to the Department or NTIA.
E. An applicant whose proposal requires an authorization from the FCC must be eligible to receive such authorization.


II. Program Goals and Priorities


The Goals of this program as stated in section 390 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 390) are:
``To assist through matching grants, in the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities
in order to achieve the following objectives:
(1) Extend delivery of public telecommunications services to as many citizens of the United States as possible by
the most efficient and economical means, including the use of broadcast and nonbroadcast technologies;
(2) Increase public telecommunications services and facilities available to, operated by, and owned by minorities
and women; and
(3) Strengthen the capability of existing public television and radio stations to provide public telecommunications
services to the public.''
The Agency has established the following priorities for the PTFP:


Special Applications


NTIA possesses the discretionary authority to recommend awarding grants to eligible broadcast and nonbroadcast
applicants whose proposals are so unique or innovative that they do not clearly fall within the priorities listed
below. Innovative projects submitted under this category must address demonstrated and substantial community
needs (e.g., service to identifiable ethnic or linguistic minority audiences, service to the blind or deaf, electronic
text, and nonbroadcast projects offering educational or instructional services).


Priority 1_Provision of Public Telecommunications Facilities for First Radio and Television Signals to a Geographic
Area


There are three subcategories:
A. 

Projects that include local origination capacity.

 This subcategory includes the planning or construction of new facilities that can provide a full range of radio and/or
television programs including material that is locally produced.
B. 

Projects that do not include local origination capacity.

 This subcategory includes projects such as increases in tower height and/or power of existing stations and construction
of translators, cable networks, and repeater transmitters that will result in providing public telecommunications
services to previously unserved areas.
C. 

Projects that provide first nationally distributed programming.

 This subcategory includes projects that provide satellite downlink facilities to noncommercial radio and television
stations that would bring nationally distributed programming to a geographic area for the first time.
Priority 1 and its subcategories apply only to grant applicants proposing to plan or construct new facilities to bring
public telecommunications services to geographic areas that are presently unserved.


Priority 2_Replacement of Basic Equipment of Existing Essential Broadcast Stations


Projects eligible for consideration under this category include the urgent replacement of obsolete or worn out equipment

Projects eligible for consideration under this category include the replacement of obsolete or worn-out equipment
and the upgrading of existing origination or delivery capacity to current industry performance standards. There
are two subcategories:

A. Under Priority 4A, NTIA will consider applications to replace urgently needed equipment from public broadcasting
stations that do not meet the Priority 2 criteria because they do not provide either the only public telecommunications
signal or the only locally originated public telecommunications signal to a geographic area. NTIA will also consider
applications that improve as well as replace urgently needed production-related equipment at public radio and television
stations that do not qualify for Priority 2 consideration but that produce, on a continuing basis, significant amounts
of programming distributed nationally to public radio or television stations.

This subcategory will also enable the acquisition of satellite downlinks for public radio stations in areas already
served by one or more full-service public radio stations. The applicant must demonstrate that it will broadcast a
program schedule that does not merely duplicate what is already available in its service area.

The final projects included in this subcategory would enable the acquisition of the necessary items of equipment
to bring the inventory of an already-operating station to the basic level of equipment requirements established
by PTFP.

B. This subcategory includes the improvement and non-urgent replacement of equipment at any public broadcasting
station.



Priority 5_Augmentation of Existing Broadcast Stations



Projects in this category would equip an existing station beyond a basic capacity to broadcast programming from distant
sources and to originate local programming.

A. 

Projects to equip auxiliary studios at remote locations, or to provide mobile origination facilities.

 An applicant must demonstrate that significant expansion in public participation in programming will result.

B. 

Projects to augment production capacity beyond basic level in order to provide programming or related materials
for other than local distribution.

 This subcategory would provide equipment for the production of programming for regional or national use.



III. Application Forms and Regulations



To apply for a PTFP grant, an applicant must file a timely and complete application on a current form approved by the
Agency. 

No previous versions of the PTFP Application Form may be used.

 (In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the current application form has been cleared under OMB control
no. 0660-0003.)

All persons and organizations on the PTFP's mailing list will be sent a copy of the current application form and the
Final Rules. Those not on the mailing list may obtain copies by contacting the PTFP at the address above. Prospective
applicants should read the Final Rules carefully before submitting applications. Applicants whose applications
were deferred will be mailed pertinent PTFP materials and instructions for requesting reactivation.


Applicants should note that they must comply with the provisions of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs.'' The Executive Order requires applicants for financial assistance under this program
to file a copy of their application with the Single Points of Contact (SPOC) of all states relevant to the project. Applicants
are required to serve a copy of their completed application on the appropriate SPOC on or before March 17, 1994. Applicants
are encouraged to contact the appropriate SPOC well before the NTIA closing date.

NTIA requires that all applicants whose proposed projects need authorization from the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) must tender an application to the FCC for such authority on or before March 17, 1994. (An application is tendered
to the FCC when it has been received by the Secretary of the FCC.) However, applicants are urged to submit it with as much
lead time before the PTFP closing date as possible. The greater the lead time, the better the chance the FCC application
will be processed to coincide with NTIA's grant cycle. NTIA may return the application of any applicant which fails
to tender an application to the FCC for any necessary authority on or before March 17, 1994.

Effective October 1, 1988, OMB Circular A-102, as it applies to grant recipients, has been superseded by Department
of Commerce regulations, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State
and Local Governments (53 FR 8034, codified at 15 CFR 24 (1988)). Applicants should note that PTFP grant recipients,
depending on their type of organization, are subject to the provisions of diverse Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circulars; i.e., A-87 ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments,'' A-21 ``Cost Principles
for Educational Institutions,'' A-110, A-122, A-128, as implemented by 15 CFR part 29a, and A-133,
as implemented by 15 CFR part 29b.
Indirect costs for construction applications are not supported by this program. The total dollar amount of the indirect
costs proposed in a planning application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and
approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or 100 percent of the total
proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less.

All non-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal if any key
individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges such as
fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial
integrity. Potential grant recipient organizations may also be subject to reviews of Dun and Bradstreet data or other
similar credit checks.
All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD-511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension,
and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.'' Applicants are further advised
that:


(1) Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension 



Prospective participants (as defined at 15 CFR part 26, section 105) are subject to 15 CFR part 26, ``Nonprocurement
Debarment and Suspension'' and the related section of the certification form;


(2) Drug-Free Workplace


Grantees (as defined at 15 CFR part 26, section 605) are subject to 15 CFR part 26, subpart F, ``Governmentwide Requirements
for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants)'' and the related section of the certification form;


(3) Anti-Lobbying


Persons (as defined at 15 CFR part 28, section 105) are subject to the lobbying provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, ``Limitation
on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and the lobbying
section of the certification form prescribed above applies to applications/bids for grants, cooperative agreements,
and contracts for more than $100,000, and loans and loan guarantees for more than $150,000, or the single family maximum
mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater; and 


(4) Anti-Lobbying Disclosures


Any applicant that has paid or will pay for lobbying using any funds must submit an SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying
Activities,'' as required under 15 CFR part 28, Appendix B.

For awards granted by NTIA, the recipient shall require applicants/bidders for subgrants, contracts, subcontracts,
or other lower tier covered transactions at any tier under the grant award to submit, if applicable, a completed Form
CD-512, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion_Lower
Tier Covered Transactions and Lobbying'' and disclosure form, SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.''
Form CD-512 is intended for the use of recipients and should not be transmitted to the Department. SF-LLL
completed by any tier recipient or subrecipient should be submitted to the Department in accordance with the instructions
contained in the award document.
If an application is selected for funding, the Department of Commerce has no obligation to provide any additional
future funding in connection with that award. Renewal or amendment of an award to increase funding or to extend the
period of performance is at the total discretion of the Department.
Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and DOC policies, regulations, and procedures
applicable to Federal financial assistance awards. In addition, unsatisfactory performance by the applicant under
prior Federal awards may result in the application not being considered for funding.


Applicants are reminded that a false statement on the application is grounds for denial or termination of funds and
grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.
If applicants incure any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed
by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal or written assurance that may have been received, there is no obligation
on the part of DOC to cover preaward costs.


IV. Funding Criteria




All PTFP funding criteria are equal in weight. 

In determining whether to approve or defer a construction grant application, in whole or in part, and the amount of
such grant, the Agency will evaluate all the information in the application file and consider, in no order of priority,
the following factors:
(a) The extent to which the project meets the program purposes set forth in the Final Rules, 15 CFR 2301.2, as well as
the specific program priorities set forth in the Appendix of those Rules;
(b) The adequacy and continuity of financial resources for long-term operational support;

and from agencies for which the applicant produces or will produce programs or other materials;
(e) The extent to which the evidence supplied in the application reasonably assures an increase in public telecommunications
services and facilities available to, operated by, and owned or controlled by minorities and women;
(f) The extent to which various items of eligible apparatus proposed are necessary to, and capable of, achieving the
objectives of the project and will permit the most efficient use of the grant funds;
(g) The extent to which the eligible equipment requested meets current broadcast industry performance standards;
(h) The extent to which the applicant will have available sufficient qualified staff to operate and maintain the facility
and provide services of professional quality;
(i) The extent to which the applicant has planned and coordinated the proposed services with other telecommunications
entities in the service area;
(j) The extent to which the project implements local, statewide or regional public telecommunications systems plans,
if any; and,

(k) The readiness of the FCC to grant any necessary authorization.
In determining whether to approve or defer a planning grant application, in whole or in part, and the amount of such
grant, the Agency will evaluate all the information in the application file and consider, in no order of priority,
the following factors:
(a) The extent to which the applicant's interests and purposes are consistent with the purposes of the Act and the priorities
of the Agency;
(b) The qualifications of the proposed project planner;
(c) The extent to which the project's proposed procedural design assures that the applicant would adequately:
(1) Obtain financial, human and support resources necessary to conduct the plan;

project (such as the availability of a frequency assignment, if necessary, for the project); and,
(e) The feasibility of the proposed procedure and timetable for achieving the expected results.



V. Matching Requirements



(a) Planning grants. A Federal grant for the planning of a public telecommunications facility shall be in an amount
determined by the Agency and set forth in the award document and the attachments thereto. The Agency may provide up
to 100 percent of the funds necessary for the planning of a public telecommunications construction project.
(b) Construction grants.
(1) A Federal grant award for the construction of a public telecommunications facility shall be an amount determined
by the Agency and set forth in the award document. Such amount may not exceed 75 percent of the amount determined by the
Agency to be the reasonable and necessary cost of such project.






Special Note: 

As originally stated in the August 20, 1987, PTFP Final Rules, and as reaffirmed and clarified in a November 22, 1991,
PTFP Policy Statement, NTIA has established a policy which is intended to encourage stations to increase from 25%
to 50% the matching percentage in their proposals for equipment replacement, improvement, and augmentation. The
Agency has emphasized that applicants proposing to provide first service to a geographic area encounter considerable
ineligible costs, including construction or renovation of buildings or other similar expenses. NTIA, therefore,
expects to continue funding projects to extend service at up to 75% of the total project cost. Applicants from small
community-licensed stations, or those who can show that a station licensed to a large institution cannot obtain direct
or in-kind support from the larger institution, also will not be subject to this preference. Otherwise, a showing
of extraordinary need or an emergency situation will be taken into consideration as justification for grants of up
to 75% of the project cost, but the presumption of 50% funding will be the general rule for applications calling for
the replacement, improvement, or augmentation of equipment.




(2) No part of the grantee's matching share of the eligible project costs may be met with funds paid by the Federal government,
except where the use of such funds to meet a Federal matching requirement is specifically and expressly authorized
by Federal statute.
(3) Funds supplied to an applicant by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting may not be used for the required non-Federal
matching purposes, except upon a clear and compelling showing of need.
(4) The expenditure of any local matching funds prior to the Closing Date will be disallowed.
(5) 

The Applicants should note that expenditure of local matching funds prior to the award of a grant is at the applicant's
own risk. 

The exact amount of the match will not be known with certainty until the final award agreement is negotiated. Therefore,
should the applicant's expenditure of non-Federal funds exceed the non-Federal share which will be established
in the final award agreement, then either the Federal share of the total project cost may be reduced by a corresponding
amount, or no Federal award may be offered.



VI. Selection Process and Project Period



PTFP grants are awarded on the basis of a competitive review process. This includes several grant review panels, which
apply the Funding Criteria listed in section V above. The Agency determines the selection of grantees according to
the Priorities listed in section III above and the evaluation of the applications by the various review panels.
Planning grant award periods customarily do not exceed one year, whereas construction grant award periods commonly
range up to two years. Although these time frames are generally applied to the award of all PTFP grants, variances in
project periods may be based on specific circumstances of an individual proposal.

The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2535-0084. 



I. Purpose and Substantive Description 



A. Authority 



This competition is authorized under the Community Outreach Partnership Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 5307 note; hereafter
referred to as the ``COPC Act''). The COPC Act is contained in section 851 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992). Section 801(c) of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 provides for a $7.5 million set-aside for each year of the 5-year demonstration authorized in the COPC Act.
(The funds appropriated by Congress for FY 1993 were rescinded by the 1993 Supplemental Appropriations Act, Pub.
L. 103-50, approved July 2, 1993.) 



B. Allocation and Form of Award 



The competition in this NOFA is for $7.0 million to fund the first year of the Community Outreach Partnership Centers
(COPC) Program authorized as indicated above. An additional $500,000 will be used to fund the first year of the National
Clearinghouse mandated by section 851(j) of the COPC Act. A separate announcement will be issued at a later date for
the National Clearinghouse. 

Each grant made under the COPC program will be for a maximum two year period of performance. The maximum size of any grant
will be $750,000, while the minimum will be $250,000. Each applicant must submit an application within this range.
In future years, successful applicants will have to compete for funds with all other applicants. 



C. Description of Competition 



The Congress has mandated that the Department carry out ``a 5-year demonstration to determine the feasibility of
facilitating partnerships between institutions of higher education and communities to solve urban problems through
research, outreach and the exchange of information.'' 

The COPC Act stipulates that grants are to go to public and private institutions of higher education to establish and
operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). These centers shall: ``(a) Conduct competent and qualified
research and investigation on theoretical or practical problems in large and small cities; and (B) Facilitate partnerships
and outreach activities between institutions of higher education, local communities, and local governments to
address urban problems.'' 

The specific problems that grants under the COPC program must focus on are ``problems associated with housing, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention,
planning, community organizing, and other areas deemed appropriate by the Secretary.'' 

Furthermore, the COPC Act states: ``The Secretary shall give preference to institutions of higher education that
undertake research and outreach activities by bringing together knowledge and expertise in the various social science
and technical disciplines that relate to urban problems.'' 

It is clear from the statutory language quoted above, and the program requirements and selection criteria detailed
below, that Congress intended that COPC be multi-disciplined, combine research with outreach, work with communities
and local governments and address the multi-dimensional problems that beset urban areas. To be most effective during
the term of the demonstration, the assisted research must have a clear near-term potential for solving specific significant
urban problems. The selected institutions must have the capacity to apply their research results and to work with
communities and local institutions, including neighborhood groups, in applying research results to specific real-life
urban problems, including design of comprehensive strategies and consolidated housing and community development
plans to resolve these problems. 



D. Eligible Applicants 



Applicants for this competition must be public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education granting four
year degrees and accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education.

A consortium of institutions may be part of any application, but one institution must be designated as the legal applicant.
Finally, each institution may be part of only one consortium or submit only one application, although the application
can include various schools within the institution. 



E. Program Requirements 



Grantees must meet the following program requirements: 

1. 

Responsibilities.

 Each Center shall: 

(a) Employ the research and outreach resources of its sponsoring institution of higher education to solve specific
urban problems identified by communities served by the Center; 

(b) Establish outreach activities in areas identified in the grant application as the communities to be served; 

(c) Establish a community advisory committee comprised of representatives of local institutions and residents
of the communities to be served to assist in identifying local needs and advise on the development and implementation
of strategies to address those issues; 

(d) Coordinate outreach activities in communities to be served by the Center; 

(e) Facilitate public service projects in the communities served by the Center;

(f) Act as a clearinghouse for dissemination of information; 

(g) Develop instructional programs, convene conferences, and provide training for local community leaders, when
appropriate; and 

(h) Exchange information with other Centers. 

The clearinghouse function in (f) above refers to a local or regional clearinghouse for dissemination of information,
including empowerment zone and enterprise communities information and consolidated housing and community development
plans information, to local governments and neighborhood groups. This clearinghouse must deal with the problems
being addressed at the local level. It is separate and distinct from the functions in (h) above, which relate to the
provision of information to the National Clearinghouse which will serve all funded centers. 

Grantees serving areas which include or are near Federally-designated empowerment zones or enterprise communities
will have to assist such zones and communities in developing the required strategic plans and helping implement them.


In addition, grantees serving areas which include or are near colonias, as defined in section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act, must provide clearinghouse services to help improve living conditions and standards
within colonias. 

2. 

Match. 

Grantees must meet the following match requirements: 

(a) 

Research Activities. 

50 percent of the project costs of establishing and operating research activities. 

(b) 

Outreach Activities. 

25 percent of the project costs of establishing and operating outreach activities. 

This non-Federal share may include cash or the value of non-cash contributions, equipment and other allowable in-kind
contributions as detailed in Attachment E of OMB Circular No. A-110, Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of High Education, Hospitals, and other Nonprofit organizations. 

3. 

Statement of Work. 

Each applicant must develop and submit a Statement of Work which incorporates all eligible activities proposed in
its application and details how the proposed work will be accomplished. Following a task-by-task format, the Statement
of Work must: 

(a) Delineate the tasks and sub-tasks involved in each of the areas for which the Center is responsible, including
research activities, outreach/technical assistance activities, community advisory committee activities, local/regional
clearinghouse activities, and other activities necessary to carry out the responsibilities delineated under Program
Requirement 

#

1 outlined above. 

(b) Indicate the sequence in which the tasks are to be performed, noting areas of work which must be performed simultaneously.


(c) State the intermediate and end products to be developed by task and sub-task. 

(d) Provide a framework for, and be consistent with, the Project Management Work Plan requirements (to be provided
in the Application Kit).

 




Note: 

Where an application is prepared prior to the designation of empowerment zones or enterprise communities, then the
affected applicants selected for awards will be required, when necessary, to revise their statement of work to incorporate
the activities needed to assist such zones and communities.

 


4. 

Administrative. 

The grant will be governed by the provision of OMB Circulars A-110 (Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education, Hospitals and other Nonprofit Organizations), A-122 (Cost Principles for Nonprofit
Organizations), and A-133 (Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and other Nonprofit Institutions),
as implemented at 24 CFR part 45. 



F. Eligible Activities

1. Research activities which have no clear and immediate practical application for solving urban problems or do not
address specific problems in designated communities and neighborhoods. 

2. Any type of construction, rehabilitation, or other physical development costs. 

3. Costs used for day-to-day administration of regular programs of institutions of higher education, local governments
or neighborhood groups. 



II. Selection Criteria/Rating Factors 



A. Rating Factors 



HUD will use the following criteria to rate and rank applications received in response to this NOFA. The factors and
maximum points for each factor are provided below. The maximum number of points is 100. 

Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include
any sub-contractors, consultants and sub-recipients which are firmly committed to the project. 

(1) (10 points) The demonstrated research resources available to the applicant for carrying out the purposes of the
COPC Act. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's organization and staff have
recent, relevant and successful experience in undertaking research activities in specific communities which have
clear near-term potential for practical application to significant urban problems associated with housing, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention,
planning and community organizing. 

(2) (10 points) The demonstrated outreach resources available to the applicant for carrying out the purposes of the
COPC Act. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's organization and staff have
recent, relevant and successful experience in applying research results through outreach activities, including
the provision of technical expertise and assistance, to solve or ameliorate the impact of significant urban problems
associated with the areas listed in factor 

#

1 above. 

(3) (5 points) The demonstrated commitment of the applicant to supporting research and outreach programs by providing
matching contributions for the Federal assistance received. In rating this factor, HUD will provide an increasing
number of points for increasing amounts of contributions beyond the statutory 50 percent for research and 25 percent
for outreach.

<TEXT>
 

(4) (10 points) The capability of the applicant to provide leadership in solving community problems and in making
national contributions to solving long-term and immediate urban problems. HUD will evaluate the two parts of this
factor separately, giving them equal weight. In rating the first sub-factor, HUD will consider the extent to which
the institution of higher education can demonstrate that it has taken a leadership position in solving specific community
problems in the past. In rating the second sub-factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant can demonstrate
that its published research and other activities place it in a leadership position toward making a national contribution
to solving longer-term and immediate urban problems. 

(5) (15 points) The extent of need in the communities to be served by the applicant. HUD will consider the extent to which
the proposal clearly delineates a need or needs in the affected communities that can be resolved through the activities
of a COPC. The applicant must demonstrate how these needs were determined and how the COPC will help resolve these needs.


(6) (7 points) The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of research and successful strategies
developed through outreach activities to other COPC and communities served through this demonstration program.
In rating this factor, HUD will evaluate the past experience of the applicant's staff and the scope and potential of
the applicant's proposal to serve as a local/regional clearinghouse or use other means to disseminate information
on its own and other COPC research results and strategies to: (a) Local communities in its area and (b) other communities
and COPC through the National Clearinghouse. 

(7) (15 points) The projects and activities that the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant. In rating this
factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's proposal effectively addresses the following: (a)
Identifies specific communities (including colonias, where appropriate), neighborhoods within communities,
