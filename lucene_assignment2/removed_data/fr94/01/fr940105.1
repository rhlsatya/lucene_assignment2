Sodium Citrate as a Tripe Denuding Agent



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit
the use of sodium citrate in solution to denude beef stomachs of mucous membranes. In 1990, a manufacturer of processing
aids and other direct food ingredients petitioned the Food and Drug Administration and FSIS to approve the use of several
compounds, including sodium citrate, for use in denuding tripe. FSIS has reviewed the data and other information
submitted by the petitioner and has determined that the proposed use of sodium citrate would not result in product
adulteration or misbranding. The proposed regulation would make available to meat processors an additional, alternative
tripe-denuding formulation that would contain sodium citrate as an ingredient. The sodium citrate solution would
be as effective as existing tripe-denuding agents, but would be less objectionable to workers than the agents now
in use. The sodium citrate-containing formulation would contribute to improved tripe production. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Executive Order 12866



This proposed rule is in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and the Assistant Secretary has determined that
it is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' This proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than
$100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health and safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities;
(3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
(4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights or obligations
or recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. 



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
requirements with respect to premises, facilities, and operations of federally inspected meat or poultry products,
and any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat and poultry products
that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA and PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may,
however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments
for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under
the FMIA or PPIA, or in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into
the United States. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products
and establishments.

This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect, and no applicable administrative procedures must
be exhausted before any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. However, the applicable administrative
procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions
of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under
the FMIA. The applicable administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial
challenge to the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions. 


Effect on Small Entities


The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The proposed regulation would make
available to meat processors an additional, alternative tripe-denuding formulation that would contain sodium
citrate as an ingredient. The sodium citrate formulation could be manufactured and sold in liquid form and used in
existing or newly developed tripe denuding equipment. The sodium citrate-containing formulation could be used
most efficiently in the new equipment and contribute to improved tripe production. Small establishments could benefit
from the use of the sodium citrate product. 


Background


Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), FSIS provides for mandatory inspection of meat and meat food products shipped in interstate and foreign commerce.
The Act prohibits the addition of any substance to any meat or meat food product that may render the product adulterated
(21 U.S.C. 601). Section 318.7(a)(1) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7) prohibits the use of
any substance in the preparation of any product unless its use is approved in  318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat
inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7), which is the chart of substances acceptable for use in the preparation of products,
or unless it is approved elsewhere in the regulations or it is approved by the Administrator. 
In 1990, a manufacturer of processing aids and other direct food ingredients petitioned the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and FSIS to approve the use of several compounds, including sodium citrate, for use in denuding tripe. Tripe
denudation_the removal of mucous membranes from beef stomachs_is a necessary step in the cleaning and preparation
of tripe for use as human food. FSIS has reviewed the data and other information submitted by the petitioner and has
determined that the proposed use of sodium citrate would not result in product adulteration or misbranding. 
FDA lists sodium citrate as generally recognized as safe when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice
in an amount not in excess of that required to achieve its intended effect (21 CFR 182.1751). In an August 24, 1992, letter
to the petitioner, FDA reported this fact and stated that it would have ``no objection to [sodium citrate's] addition
to the tripe-denuding mixture [contemplated by the petitioner] providing that it is used in accordance with good
manufacturing practice.''

1

 FDA further stipulated that the sodium citrate used be of food-grade quality and that the quantity used not be in excess
of the amount reasonably required to accomplish its intended effect. 




FSIS is proposing to amend  318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the use of sodium
citrate as a tripe denuding agent in combination with other approved agents, in an amount sufficient to accomplish
the intended effect. Use of sodium citrate for this purpose would be subject to the condition that the substance be
removed from the denuded tripe by rinsing with potable water.

Use of Trisodium Phosphate on Raw, Chilled Poultry Carcasses



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FSIS is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations to permit the application of trisodium phosphate
(TSP) on raw, chilled poultry carcasses passed for wholesomeness. TSP would be permitted as an antimicrobial agent
on such poultry carcasses at a level of 8 to 12 percent. The TSP treatment solution would be maintained at a temperature
of 45
  F. to 55
  F. and applied by spraying or dipping carcasses for up to 15 seconds. Tests conducted by industry have shown that
the use of TSP at a level of 8 to 12 percent reduces microbial populations on raw, chilled poultry surfaces. This proposed
rule is in response to a petition filed by Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Order 12866



FSIS has determined that this regulatory action is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. It would not
likely result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule would
provide for the use of TSP as an antimicrobial treatment on raw, chilled poultry carcasses passed for wholesomeness.

States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing any
requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities, and operations of such establishments,
that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted
under the PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected
poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions
may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over poultry products that are outside official establishments
for the purpose of preventing the distribution of poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the PPIA
or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States.
States and local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions that are consistent with the PPIA,
with respect to any other matters regulated under the PPIA.

Under the PPIA, States that maintain poultry inspection programs must impose requirements on State-inspected products
and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the PPIA. These States may, however, impose more
stringent requirements on such State-inspected products and establishments.

In the event of its adoption, no retroactive effect would be given to this proposed rule, and applicable administrative
procedures must be exhausted before any judicial challenge to the application of these provisions. Those administrative
procedures are set forth in 9 CFR 381.35.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator, FSIS, has determined that the proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The proposed rule would permit the use of TSP at the establishment's option.

Establishments that decide to use TSP as an antimicrobial agent on their products would incur a one-time expense for
the necessary equipment and an ongoing cost for purchasing TSP. The cost for the treatment equipment would be approximately
$45,000 per processing line. The cost for the TSP would average about 1/2 cent per bird.

The production of ready-to-cook poultry containing lower amounts of bacteria than such poultry now available would
contribute to the national effort to reduce the incidence of pathogenic bacteria in foods. Most consumers are willing
to pay more for poultry products that are raised or processed in a way that reduces the levels of 

Salmonella 

on such products.
 Therefore, the market for TSP-treated poultry carcasses would likely attract most consumers who desire additional
protection from harmful microorganisms. In turn, poultry establishments that market TSP-treated poultry carcasses
could benefit from increased sales.





Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this proposal. Written comments should be sent to the
Policy Office at the address shown above and should refer to Docket Number 92-026P. Any person desiring opportunity
for oral presentation of views, as provided under the PPIA, should make such request to Dr. James at (202) 720-3219
so that arrangements may be made for such views to be presented. A record will be made of all such oral comments. Copies
of all comments submitted in response to this proposal will be available for public inspection in the Policy Office
between 9 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and between 1:30 and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.



Background



FSIS is responsible for assuring that poultry products distributed in commerce are wholesome, not adulterated,
and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 451-470), FSIS provides mandatory inspection
of poultry and poultry products shipped in interstate and foreign commerce, as well as in designated States. Continuous
inspection of poultry slaughtering establishments is intended to assure that fresh, ready-to-cook poultry carcasses
and parts are free of visible signs of disease and contamination. FSIS inspectors examine the outside, inside, and
viscera of all birds presented for inspection.

Because raw poultry furnish a rich medium for the potential growth of both beneficial and harmful microorganisms,
it has been assumed traditionally that a certain level of microbial activity on the surface tissues of raw poultry
was unavoidable. Consequently, poultry slaughter inspection activities have focused on the organoleptic detection
of poultry diseases or other abnormalities in carcasses and parts that would render the products adulterated or unwholesome.


Over the years, scientific and public concern about microbiological contamination of poultry products has expanded
from the processing of such products to conditions under which poultry are slaughtered, and even to preslaughter
poultry production. FSIS has encouraged the scientific community and the regulated industry to develop slaughtering
and processing methods and treatments that would yield raw poultry products that are as free as practicable of pathogenic
bacteria. The control of miscrooganisms on raw poultry has been given a high priority on FSIS's research agenda. 

Researchers estimate that from 6.5 million to 33 million Americans, or 3 to 14 percent of the population, become ill
each year from consumption of foods containing microorganisms. An estimated 9,000 of these illnesses result in death,
or 4 in 100,000 people. Chapter 4 of a 1985 report by the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences, Meat
and Poultry Inspection: The Scientific Basis of the Nation's Program, recommended, in part, that the poultry inspection
program be refocused to place greater emphasis on microbiological and chemical testing.
 Since the issuance of that report, FSIS has given greater priority to microbiological and chemical testing. 




Among the diseases caused by foodborne microorganisms, the one receiving the most publicity in recent years has been
salmonellosis. This common human intestinal disorder was estimated to cost Americans approximately $1 billion
in 1987. 

Much of the concern about 

Salmonella

 in the food supply has focused on chicken. FSIS has encouraged and permitted the industry to use technologies such
as counterflow scalders, chlorinated inplant water, and ionizing radiation to reduce 

Salmonella

 and other pathogenic bacteria. 



Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Petition 



FSIS has been petitioned by Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey, to permit the use of food-grade TSP as a processing
aid in post-chill poultry slaughter operations.
 The petitioner requested the use of a treatment solution consisting of TSP dissolved in water to a concentration of
10 percent, plus or minus 2 percent (8 to 12 percent). The petitioner requested exposure of the poultry to the TSP treatment
solution for no more than 15 seconds, with the TSP treatment solution being maintained at 50
  F., plus or minus 5
  F. (45
  F. to 55
  F.). 






The petitioner supplied data demonstrating that the use of TSP, under the parameters addressed above, is effective
in reducing the levels of bacteria, including pathogenic bacteria, found on raw, chilled poultry carcasses. Immediately
after chilling, poultry carcasses that have been passed for wholesomeness enter the TSP treatment system. Chilled
poultry carcasses are either sprayed with or dipped in the TSP treatment solution for no more than 15 seconds. The concentration
of TSP used in various studies conducted by or for the petitioner ranged from 8 to 12 percent in water, at temperatures
ranging from 45
  F. to 55
  F. 

Data from the petitioner included results of studies conducted by the Pennsylvania State Sensory Laboratory for
Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., on consumer acceptability of cooked poultry derived from TSP-treated poultry carcasses.
These studies show no significant difference in taste or appearance between cooked poultry from TSP-treated poultry
carcasses and cooked poultry from untreated poultry. 

The petitioner also provided study results concerning moisture pickup and residue findings in poultry carcasses
treated with TSP. According to these study results, the moisture pickup in TSP-treated poultry carcasses does not
exceed regulatory limits for moisture absorption as prescribed in 9 CFR 381.66(d)(5). Residue findings ranged from
^0.25 percent to 0.11 percent, showing that virtually no residue of the TSP solution remains on or in the treated poultry
carcasses.

FSIS Studies on TSP



FSIS also conducted studies to determine the efficacy of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses.
 These studies show that the use of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses results in statistically significant reductions
in the levels of bacteria. Summary statistics of bacterial plate counts were used in all statistical analyses based
on the arithmetic average and statistical significance was determined through nonparametric procedures using
the relative rank of values. Analyses of 256 carcass-rinse samples collected at a federally inspected establishment
over 4 days indicated that carcasses had average aerobe plate counts of 328 before TSP application, and 78 after application;
Enterobacteriaceae counts of 25.5 before TSP application, and 2.7 after application; and 

Escherichia coli 

counts of 10.1 before TSP application, and 0.2 after treatment. Although these particular studies found no salmonellae
in untreated or treated carcasses, preliminary results from industry group testing show that TSP is also effective
in reducing salmonellae on raw poultry. Studies on moisture absorption resulting from the use of TSP found no inconsistencies
with data furnished by the petitioner.





Food Additive Status



TSP is listed in the Food and Drug Administrated (FDA) regulations as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for multiple
purpose use in accordance with good manufacturing practice (21 CFR 182.1778).

FDA evaluated the petitioner's request for the use of TSP as a processing aid in poultry and concluded that the treatment
leaves no residues on the product that could be harmful to consumers. Therefore, in an August 25, 1992, letter, FDA
approved the use of TSP as a processing aid on raw poultry, under conditions to be established by FSIS.






The Proposal



The Administrator has determined that (1) the use of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses is in compliance with applicable
FDA requirements, (2) its use is functional and suitable for the intended purpose, (3) the substance is used at the
lowest acceptable level to consistently achieve the desired reduction of pathogenic bacteria as determined in specific
cases, and (4) the use of this substance on raw, chilled poultry carcasses at the stated level will not render the treated
product adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise not in accordance with the requirements of the PPIA.

Therefore, FSIS is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations at 9 CFR 381.147(f)(4) to add antimicrobial
agents as a new class of substance for use on poultry products, and to add TSP as an approved antimicrobial agent. As
requested by the petitioner, TSP would be permitted for use on raw, chilled poultry carcasses passed for wholesomeness
at a level of 8 to 12 percent. The TSP treatment solution would be maintained at 45 
 F. to 55 
 F., and would be applied either by spraying or dipping the raw, chilled poultry carcasses for no more than 15 seconds.
FSIS has determined, through review of the petitioner's data and its own study results, that 15 seconds is the maximum
time necessary to coat all surfaces of the poultry carcasses with the TSP solution. FSIS is proposing the application
of TSP by spraying, as well as by dipping, to permit the use of any existing spraying equipment in establishments, and
thus reduce the costs incurred by establishments to set up the TSP treatment system.

Although the use of TSP would not eliminate the need for continuing careful handling of raw poultry products, TSP treatment
on raw, chilled poultry carcasses would reduce the levels of bacteria that may be present on raw poultry carcasses.

TSP leaves virtually no residue on or in the carcass of treated poultry that would require the labels of such treated
product to show the presence of TSP. Therefore, poultry producers opting to use TSP would not be required to revise
their product labels.

Future Harmonized Rotorcraft Rulemaking; Normal Category Maximum Weight; Meeting



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA is announcing a public meeting to discuss the use of Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Commission procedures in
future harmonized rulemaking. Once specific rulemaking topic that will be discussed is a proposed increase in the
current maximum gross weight limitation of 6,000 pounds for certification as a normal category rotorcraft.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Rotorcraft Directorate, has recently completed a series of harmonization
meetings with the Helicopter Airworthiness Study Group (HASG) of the European Joint Airworthiness Authorities
(JAA). The meetings were supplemented with joint authorities and industry meetings. These meetings resulted in
the issuance of European Joint Airworthiness Requirements 27 (September 1993) and 29 (November 1993), which are
in basic harmonization with Federal Aviation Regulations parts 27 and 29 (FAR 27 and 29). Current rulemaking using
the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) is intended to amend FAR 27 and 29 to complete the harmonization
process for existing rules.



To assure future rotorcraft rulemaking is harmonized to the greatest extent practical and to provide information
on rulemaking using the ARAC, the FAA believes that a public meeting is warranted.

The public meeting will also be used to discuss draft revisions for Advisory Circular (AC) 27-1, Change 3, and
AC 29-2A, Change 2 (58 FR 67893, December 22, 1993).



Future Harmonized Rotorcraft Rulemaking_General



Status reports on the current harmonization efforts will be made by American and European authorities and industry
representatives. A presentation on the ARAC will be made. Discussion will follow the presentation and will focus
on the following items:

 


_ARAC

_International Harmonization of rulemaking

_Future rotorcraft rulemaking_general



Normal Category Maximum Gross Weight of 6,000 Pounds 



Since 1956 the FAA has based the primary and obvious distinction between normal and transport category rotorcraft
certification requirements on the maximum certificated gross weight of the aircraft. The upper gross weight limit
for normal category rotorcraft was set at 6,000 pounds, based on existing and anticipated designs. All rotorcraft
above the 6,000 pounds maximum certificated gross weight are required to be certificated in the transport category.

Recently the FAA received two requests for exemptions from this criteria and numerous recommendations for varying
degrees of changes to the airworthiness standards. The FAA recognizes that helicopters, and their operational roles,
have evolved since the 6,000-pound rule was established in 1956, and therefore some changes may be warranted. Based
on this recognition, the FAA developed an issue paper entitled ``Certification Categories for Civil Rotorcraft.''
This paper will be used to facilitate discussion at the public meeting. Copies of the paper have been mailed to interested
parties. Additional interested parties who have not received a copy of the paper by January 1, 1994, may obtain a copy
by contacting the person listed under 

``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''



Meeting Procedures



The meeting is being chaired by the Rotorcraft Directorate. Participants will include FAA representatives from
Flight Standards, Legal Counsel, and the Office of International Aviation; JAA representatives from engineering
and operations; and industry groups from the U.S. and Europe.

The following procedures will be used to conduct the meeting: 

1. Registration will be from 8-9 a.m. PDT on February 2, 1994. There will be no registration fee. Preregistration
is recommended and may be accomplished by contacting the person listed under the caption ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
CONTACT.''

2. The meeting will be recorded by a court reporter, and transcripts will be available for purchase directly from the
court reporter.

3. Statements by the FAA will be made to facilitate discussion and should not be taken as expressing a final FAA position.

4. The FAA will consider all material presented at the meeting by participants. Handouts will be accepted at the discretion
of the chairperson; however, enough copies should be provided for distribution to all participants.

Discussion 


This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. (BHTI) Model 205A, 205A-1, 205B, 212, and 412 series helicopters, equipped with a main transmission lower
planetary spider (spider), part number (P/N) 412-040-785-101. During recent BHTI fatigue tests,
five spiders failed due to structural fatigue. Previously, there was no retirement life established for the spider.
However, based on these test results, the FAA proposes to establish a 2,500 hours' time-in-service (TIS) retirement
life for this design spider. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fatigue failure of the spider, failure
of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved (1) BHTI Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) 205-93-54, dated June 18, 1993,
applicable to Model 205A-1 helicopters; (2) ASB 205B-93-16, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to
Model 205B helicopters; (3) ASB 212-93-83, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 212 helicopters;
and (4) ASB 412-93-72, Revision A, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 412 helicopters. These ASBs
describe procedures for the removal, retirement, and replacement of certain spiders when they reach 2,500 hours'
TIS. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require removal and replacement of spiders with less than 2,400 hours' TIS, prior to
or upon attaining 2,500 hours' TIS or, for spiders with 2,400 hours' or more TIS, within the next 100 hours' TIS. This
AD also establishes a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 
The FAA estimates that 40 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
26 workhours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per workhour.
Required parts would cost approximately $8,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $414,360. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. Model 214B, 214B-1, and 214ST helicopters. This proposal would establish a mandatory retirement life
of 60,000 high-power events for the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), which is currently not a life-limited part. This
proposal is prompted by the manufacturer's analysis and retesting that has shown that the trunnion is sensitive to
high-power events. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion,
that could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention:
Rules Docket No. 93-SW-20-AD, 4400 Blue Mound Road, bldg. 3B, room 158, Fort Worth, Texas 76106.




Discussion 



This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. Model 214B, 214B-1, and 214ST helicopters. Recent retesting and analysis has shown that the main rotor
trunnion (trunnion), part number 214-010-230-101, is sensitive to high-power events. High power
events are takeoffs and external load lifts. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fatigue failure of
the trunnion, loss of the main rotor, and subsequent loss of the control of the helicopter. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require for the trunnion, within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective
date of this AD, (1) creation of a component history card; (2) accumulation of the historical high-power events; and
(3) thereafter, recording of the high-power events as they occur. Additionally, the proposed AD would establish
a trunnion retirement life of 60,000 high-power events. 

The FAA estimates that 15 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $10,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $29,523, assuming inspection and modification of one-sixth of
the fleet is required each year. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft

PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 








Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 



 39.13



[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 








Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.: 

Docket No. 93-SW-20-AD. 





Applicability: 

Model 214B, 214B-1, and 214ST helicopters, equipped with main rotor trunnion (trunnion), part number 214-010-230-101,
certificated in any category. 



Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.

To prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion as a result of takeoffs and external loads lifts (high-power events), that
could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:


(a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish
the following: 

(1) Create a historical service record or component history card for the trunnion. 

(2) Determine the actual time-in-service of the trunnion from maintenance records, if possible. If the actual time-in-service
cannot be determined, use a time-in-service of 900 hours per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. 

(3) For Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion
as follows: 

(i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 12 high-power events for each hour time-in-service obtained
in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). 

(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, divide that number by 2 and record the resulting number as the total
accumulated high-power events. 

(4) For Model 214ST helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows:


(i) If the number of events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour time-in-service obtained in accordance
with paragraph (a)(2). 

(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as the total accumulated high-power events. 

(b) After the effective date of this AD, continue to record high-power events in the aircraft maintenance record.
For Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters, divide the number of high-power events by 2 and add the resulting number
to the previously recorded sum. For Model 214ST helicopters, add the high-power events to the previously recorded
sum. 

(c) Remove the trunnion and replace it with an airworthy trunnion in accordance with the following: 

(1) For each trunnion with 59,400 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the
trunnion on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. 

(2) For each trunnion with less than 59,400 high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the
trunnion on or before attaining 60,000 high-power events. 

(d) This AD revises the helicopter Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing
a new retirement life for the trunnion. 

(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time, which provides an acceptable level
of safety, may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate,
Fort Worth, Texas 76193-0170. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance
Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office. 








Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained

Vanity Call Sign System



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action proposes to authorize the use of vanity call signs in the amateur service. The proposed rules are necessary
so that amateur operators can request specific call signs with letters that signify something of importance to them
such as their initials or their nicknames. This proposal would give better service to members of the amateur community
because it would allow them to choose their own calls signs provided the call sign chosen is unassigned and within the
framework of the license class held. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, adopted December 13, 1993, and released December
29, 1993. The complete text of this Commission action, including the proposed rule amendments, is available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference center (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC.
The complete text of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the proposed rule amendments, may also be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, Inc., (ITS, Inc.), 2100 M Street,
NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.



Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making



1. The Licensing Division of the Private Radio Bureau is installing a new automated licensing process that will give
it the capability to administer a vanity call sign system. The Commission, therefore, on its own motion, is proposing
to amend the amateur service rules to implement a system wherein amateur station licensees can select call signs of
their own choice, provided they are not already assigned and are within the framework of the operator license class
held by the applicant.

2. The vanity call sign system would be in addition to the current sequential call sign system that would be continued
to be used for those applicants who do not want a vanity call sign.

3. The proposed rules would allow the licensee of an existing primary station to request a modification of the licensee
to show a call sign selected by the licensee. This privilege would also be extended to the license trustee of an existing
club station.

4. It is also proposed to administer a club and military recreation station sequential call sign system under our new
automated licensing process.

5. An applicant could list ten call signs on the application form in order of preference. The first available call sign
from the applicant's list would be assigned. If none of the call signs listed are available, the automated process
would reassign the call sign that the applicant had vacated.

6. The proposed vanity call sign system is designed to be practicable to administer and simple for the amateur community
to use. Comments are invited on the entire proposal and specifically on the following matters. Could other means,
such as magnetic computer disks, be used to apply directly to the Commission for a vanity call sign in lieu of the traditional
paper application form? Could some type of access be made available to the public to check with the Commission for call
sign availability? What options are available so that the public could apply for a license electronically and receive
authorization to begin operation by the same means?

7. In addition, commenters may wish to submit alternatives suggesting ways that military recreation and RACES stations
might be able to be brought into a system that would afford them call signs of choice.

8. The proposed rules are set forth at the end of this document.

9. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding.



Ex parte

 presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as specified
in the Commission's Rules. See generally 47 CFR 1.1202, 12.1203, and 1.1206(a).

10. In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies
that the proposed rules would not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
business entities because the amateur stations that are the subject of this proceeding would not be authorized to
transmit any communications where the station licensee or control operator has a pecuniary interest. See  97.113(a)(3).

11. This Notice of Proposed Rule Making and the proposed rule amendments are issued under the authority of sections
4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r).

12. A copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making will be forwarded to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration.
