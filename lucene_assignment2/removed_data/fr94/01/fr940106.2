<DOCTITLE>Meat Import Limitations; First Quarterly Estimate</DOCTITLE>



Public Law 88-482, enacted August 22, 1964, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2253 note (the ``Act''), provided for limiting
the quantity of fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of bovine, sheep except lamb, and goats; and processed meat of beef or
veal (Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheadings 0201.10.00, 0201.20.20, 0201.10.40, 0201.20.60,
0201.30.20, 0201.30.40, 0201.30.60, 0202.10.00, 0202.20.20, 0202.20.40, 0202.20.60, 0202.30.20, 0202.30.40,

than Canada and Mexico, which may be imported into the United States in any Calendar year. Such limitations are to be
imposed when the Secretary of Agriculture estimates that imports of articles, other than products of Canada and Mexico,
provided for in Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheadings 0201.10.00, 0201.20.40, 0201.20.60,

in the absence of limitations under the Act during such calendar year, would equal or exceed 110 percent of the estimated
aggregate quantity of meat articles prescribed for calendar year 1994 by subsection 2(c) as adjusted under subsection
2(d) of the Act.

In accordance with the requirements of the Act, I have made the following estimates:

1. The estimated aggregate quantity of meat articles prescribed by subsection 2(c) as adjusted by subsection 2(d)
of the Act for calendar year 1994 is 1,108.1 million pounds.

2. The first quarterly estimate of the aggregate quantity of meat articles which would, in the absence of limitations
under the Act, be imported during calendar year 1994 is 1,218.8 million pounds.




Done at Washington, DC this 30th day of December, 1993.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement for the Mad River Water Withdrawal and Sugarbush South Snowmaking and Trail Improvement
Project; Green Mountain National Forest; Towns of Warren and Fayston; Washington County, VT</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



The Forest Service is the lead agency for preparing the Environmental Impact Statement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department of Interior_Fish and Wildlife Service are cooperating
agencies. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare a Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statement
to determine whether to authorize additional snowmaking capability and trail improvements at the Sugarbush South
Ski Area as proposed by Snowridge, Inc. Authorization of the trail improvements and snowmaking would implement a
portion of the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, approved on July 14, 1983. The
proposed use and activities are consistent with the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National
Forest and the current Special Use Permit for operation of the Sugarbush Ski Resort. Authorization would require
an amendment to the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area so that the Master Development
Plan identifies the water source for snowmaking and the schedule for water withdrawal. The Master Development Plan
would also be amended to accurately show the approved trail configuration and anticipated development schedule.



Sugarbush is a winter sports complex operated by Snowridge, Inc. and located on both private lands and National Forest
System lands. There are about 2,100 acres at Sugarbush South, the area where this project is proposed. Of that 2,100
acres, about 1825 acres are National Forest System lands.

The purpose of the actions proposed by Snowridge, Inc. is to improve the quality of winter sports recreation opportunities
at Sugarbush South by installing snowmaking equipment and facilities that would provide coverage over at least 70%
of the ski trails, and by constructing widening, and grading the trail system so that there is improved skier traffic
flow and safety. Improved trail design would also offer a better mix of opportunities for novice, intermediate, advanced,
and expert skiers.

Additional snowmaking is needed because Sugarbush South currently has snowmaking coverage on only 38% of the ski
trails. Natural snowfall is inconsistent and often inadequate during a typical Vermont winter. Predictable snow
coverage is needed if Sugarbush is to consistently provide quality winter sports recreation opportunities, be attractive
to skiers, and remain competitive with other major ski areas in New England. Increased snowmaking will also relieve
skier traffic congestion problems and improve skier safety by providing more opportunities for skiers to disperse
over many trails.

Trail widening is needed so that snow grooming equipment can be used and to relieve ``bottle-necks'' where skiers
merge. Trail construction is needed to improve inter-connections among trails, improve skier traffic flow, and
increase the number of intermediate and advanced trails so that the variety of skier experiences available is better
geared to families and groups made up of skiers with different ability levels. 

The proposed action is to: (1) Construct and operate a water withdrawal facility on the Mad River including a removable
weir, a permanent Parshall flume and two intake structures; (2) Withdraw for snowmaking use an estimated 300-420
million gallons of water per year (the estimated average is 380 Million gallons per year) from the Mad River under a
schedule which will prohibit withdrawals that would reduce flows to less than the February median flow rate (0.79
csm); (3) Construct and operate a 13-acre water storage pond located adjacent to the Mad River and having a capacity
of approximately 55 to 60 million gallons; (4) Construct and operate pumping facilities adjacent to the water storage
pond; (5) Construct a 15 foot wide, 1,800 foot long gravel access road from Highway 100 to the pond site; (6) Construct
and operate about 3.3 miles of buried 16-inch pipeline to transport water from the storage pond to the snowmaking facilities
at Sugarbush South; (7) Construct and operate a new snowmaking facility located in the vicinity of the existing vehicle
maintenance shop. This is a building housing the pumps, compressors, and control system used for snowmaking; (8)
Install approximately 90,000 feet of buried pipelines and hydrants along 24 trails at Sugarbush South and operate
for snowmaking; (9) Use water from the Mad River source and the existing source on Clay Brook for snowmaking on an additional
157 acres of ski trails; and (10) Widen 24 trails, widen 2 lift lines, construct 6 new trails, and grade several existing
trails. Total widening and trail construction will add 100 acres of skiable terrain. 

Both the Forest Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have decisions to make with respect to the proposal. The
Forest Service must decide whether to authorize the project under the Special Use Permit and whether to approve amendments
to the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must make
a decision as to whether to issue a permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to authorize the Mad River water withdrawal
structures, holding pond, access road and fill.

The purpose of the Environmental Impact Statement is to determine the environmental effects of the proposed action
and of any reasonable alternatives actions that would also achieve the purpose and need while addressing significant
issues raised through public comment and agency review. 

The alternatives may include any combination of feasible water withdrawal sources; water storage sites; and water
withdrawal schedules on source rivers or brooks as long as those alternatives would achieve the purpose and need for
this proposal while addressing significant issues that are identified during the analysis. Alternatives may include
different trail configurations if significant concerns are raised about the trail improvements being proposed.
The analysis will include a discussion of cumulative effects of all water withdrawals in the area affected by this
proposal, including the current withdrawal at Clay Brook, the proposed withdrawal on Mad River, and any alternative
water withdrawals that are identified. 

This Environmental Impact Statement and analysis will not reconsider the overall development plans for the Sugarbush
Valley Winter Sports Areas as described in the Master Development Plan approved on July 14, 1983. Forest Supervisor
Terry Hoffman completed a review of that Master Development Plan on September 30, 1993. The Forest Supervisor determined
that there is no need to change the overall development plan or supplement the 1983 Environmental Impact Statement
that was prepared in support of that Plan, except for specific amendments to the Master Development Plan associated
with the proposal from Snowridge Inc. to use the Mad River as a water source for snowmaking, increase the volume of water
used for snowmaking, and revise the trail map (or the alternative to this proposal as selected by the Forest Service).
Those specific amendments are the focus and scope of the Environmental Impact Statement that will be prepared. 

The purpose of this Notice is to inform you that the Forest Service, with assistance from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers is soliciting your comments and concerns
about this proposed action. 

The environmental analysis and decision-making process will include opportunities for public participation and
comment so that people interested in this proposal may contribute to the final decision. 

The Forest Service will host an open house to be held at the Waitsfield Elementary School, Waitsfield, Vermont, from
6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on Monday January 24, 1994. The purpose of this open house is to discuss and answer questions about
the project proposal, the analysis process that will be conducted by the Forest Service and cooperating agencies,
and the ways that people can best participate in the analysis and decision-making process. 

Public participation will be welcome throughout the analysis, but is especially important at two points. The first
point is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7). The agency is now seeking written comments and suggestions on
the scope of the analysis. Comments relevant to scoping include: (1) identifying potential issues, (2) identifying
those issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a previous
environmental analysis, (4) identifying additional alternatives to the proposed action that should be considered,
(5) identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives, and (6) determining task
assignments among the lead and cooperating agencies. General notice to the public concerning the scope of the analysis
will be provided by mailings, news releases and/or public meetings. The second point when public participation is
most important is during the public comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. 

 




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Sugarbush is a winter sports area which has operated by Special Use Permit since 1958 on National Forest System lands
administered by the Green Mountain National Forest. Most of the base lodge facilities are on provide lands, but some
of the base facilities and many of the lifts and trails are located on National Forest System lands. Sugarbush encompasses
about 6,000 acres, of which a little over 1,825 acres are on National Forest System lands at Sugarbush South (about
30%). 




Sugarbush operates in accordance with the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, which
was approved by the Forest Service on July 14, 1983. Specific operations on National Forest System lands are authorized
under a Special Use Permit issued by the Forest Service on December 9, 1988.

The proposed action is consistent with the long-range goals for this area as defined in the Land and Resource Management
Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest. That Forest Plan was approved on January 15, 1987. Under that Forest Plan,
the area encompassed by the Suguarbush Ski Area is assigned to management under prescription 7.1A. This management
prescription emphasizes highly developed areas, including downhill ski areas. The purpose of prescription 7.1A
is to provide opportunities for recreation requiring highly developed structures and facilities, maintain a visually
appealing landscape, and manage for other resources and uses in a compatible way. The Forest Service does not anticipate
the need for any amendments to the Land and Resource Management Plan as a result of this snowmaking proposal.

On September 30, 1993, the Forest Service completed a review of an Environmental Impact Statement completed in 1983
and the Master Development Plan which was approved based on that Environmental Impact Statement. Based on that review,
the Forest Supervisor determined that there was no need to supplement the 1983 Environmental Impact Statement or
revise the Master Development Plan except for amendments to the Master Development Plan that may result from the analysis
of the Mad River water withdrawal proposal. 
 
Four amendments to the Master Development Plan would likely be required if the project proposal is approved: (1) Identify
the Mad River as a source of water for snowmaking; (2) Identify the anticipated schedules and volumes for water withdrawal
and any restrictions or requirements related to snowmaking water withdrawal; (3) Revise the Master Development
Plan trails map so that it accurately displays the approved trail configuration for Sugarbush South; and (4) Update
the Development Schedule (Appendix C in the Master Development Plan) so that it shows current estimates of completion
dates for each phase of the previously approved development at Sugarbush. 
 
The proposed snowmaking facilities, trail widening, construction, and improvement, and the actual snowmaking
itself, would be located on National Forest System land operated under special use permit. Approval of these actions
which would occur on National Forest System lands requires Forest Service authorization under the Special Use Permit.

 
The Department of the Army permit program is authorized by section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, section
404 of the Clean Water Act, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. These laws require
permits authorizing activities in or affecting navigable waters of the United States, the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the United States, and the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping
it into ocean waters. The Corps must make a decision as to whether to issue a section 404 permit for activities associated
with the Mad River water withdrawal. These activities include water withdrawal structures, holding pond, access
road, and fill. The proposed water withdrawal site, storage pond, access road and most of the pipeline to the snowmaking
facility would be located on private lands. 
 
Several permits, certificates, or authorizations through the review processes established for the State of Vermont
are also required to implement the proposed action. The District Environmental Commission must issue permits under
the State of Vermont's Act 250 for various phases of the project. A 401 Certificate must be issued by the State Division
of Water Quality. A Dam Permit must be issued by the State Agency of Natural Resources. At this time, all permits or authorizations
required by the State of Vermont have been granted, except for one Act 250 permit to approve the trial improvements.

 
Until a Record of Decision based on this EIS is issued, the Sugarbush Ski Area will continue to be managed according
to the terms and conditions of the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest, the Master
Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, and the Special Use Permit. 
 
A range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action will be considered in the analysis. Reasonable alternatives
are those which fulfill the purpose and need for the proposals and address significant issues that are identified
during the scoping process. The analysis may include an evaluation of feasible alternative water sources or storage
sites which could be used either separately or in combination to meet snowmaking objectives while reducing or avoiding
impacts to the aquatic environment. Only one specific alternative to the proposed action has been identified at this
time. That is the ``no action'' alternative. If the ``no action'' alternative were selected, the proposed project
would not take place at this time. Other alternatives will be developed based on the results of scoping.

<TEXT>
 

The analysis will address major issues and concerns about the proposed action and alternatives and will disclose
the direct and indirect impacts related to those issues. The following tentative issues have been identified: (1)
Impacts to wetlands and floodplains; (2) Impacts to waterways; (3) Impacts to cultural resource; (4) Impacts to streams
from increased snowpack and runoff; (5) Impacts to fisheries; (6) Effect on the suitability of the Mad River for inclusion
in the national system of Wild and Scenic Rivers; (7) Effect on recreation opportunities, specifically skiing and
winter sports at Sugarbush South; (8) Effects on visual quality, and (9) Impacts to the local economy.
The Draft Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to
be available for public review in the summer of 1994. At that time, the Environmental Protection Agency will publish
a Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

.
The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

.
The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
After the comment period ends on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the comments will be analyzed and considered
by the agency in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
The Final Environmental Impact Statement is scheduled to be completed and available to the public approximately
5 months following the close of the review period for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The responsible Forest
Service official will document the decision and the reasons supporting it in a Record of Decision. That decision will
be subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 215.
A separate decision will be made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concerning the issuance of permits under section
404 of the Clean Water Act.
The Forest Service official responsible for approving the proposed action is Terry Hoffman, Forest Supervisor,
Green Mountain National Forest, 231 North Main Street, Rutland, VT 05701.

<DOCTITLE>Amendment to the Rural Electrification Act's ``Buy American'' Provision</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration and Rural Telephone Bank, USDA.






</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Amendment to the Rural Electrification Act's ``Buy American'' Provision.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The recently passed North America Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act has amended the Rural Electrification
Act's ``Buy American'' provision. Previously, the provision required borrowers, when using loan funds, to purchase
only equipment that was manufactured in the United States and that was made mostly from materials and supplies originating
in the United States. The amended provision permits borrowers to also purchase equipment, under similar conditions,
from Canadian or Mexican manufacturers.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law 103-182, (NAFTA Implementation Act)
was signed into law on December 8, 1993. Section 381 (d) of Subtitle G of Title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends
the REA ``Buy American'' provision established by Section 401 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 313,
318, 7 U.S.C. 901 et. seq., (1938 RE Act). The REA ``Buy American'' provision was revised by adding ``, Mexico, or Canada''
after every reference therein to the ``United States.'' 



Prior to its amendment by the NAFTA Implementation Act, the 1938 RE Act generally required borrowers, when using loan
funds, to purchase equipment that was manufactured in the United States that was made mostly from materials and supplies
originating in the United States. The NAFTA Implementation Act amendment of the 1938 RE Act takes effect on January
1, 1994. Generally speaking, after December 31, 1993, borrowers using funds from loans which have been made or guaranteed
by REA or the Rural Telephone Bank will be able to satisfy REA's ``Buy American'' provision by purchasing equipment
that has been manufactured in North America and made mostly of materials and supplies originating in North America,
i.e., in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

The REA ``Buy American'' provision as revised by the NAFTA Implementation Act reads as follows:







In making loans pursuant to this title and pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, the Administrator of
Rural Electrification Administration shall require that, to the extent practicable and the cost of which is not unreasonable,
the borrower agree to use in connection with the expenditure of such funds only such unmanufactured articles, materials,
and supplies, as have been mined or produced in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and only such manufactured articles,
materials, and supplies as have been manufactured in the United States, Mexico, or Canada substantially all from
articles, materials or supplies, mined, produced, or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States, Mexico,
or Canada.







The amended provision applies to all procurements within REA's jurisdiction that commence after December 31, 1993,
which involve any REA, Rural Telephone Bank or guaranteed loan funds. REA is notifying borrowers, as well as Canadian
and Mexican manufacturers with current REA technically-accepted products, of this change in the REA ``Buy American''
provision.

REA is also making technical revisions to its existing forms of loan contracts and loan contract amendments to conform
them to the 1938 RE Act as amended by NAFTA. REA will begin using these revised forms for all transactions entered into
after December 31, 1993. In addition, REA is making similar technical revisions to its recommended forms of contracts
providing for the purchase of materials and supplies. These changes will have no effect on any contract which is fully
in effect prior to January 1, 1994.

An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Eastern Distribution Center,
Inc., grantee of FTZ 24, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility
of Merck & Co., Inc., (Merck) in Riverside, Pennsylvania. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions
of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part
400). It was formally filed on December 28, 1993.

Merck is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers with nearly $9 billion in total sales in 1991. Its
primary product lines include: Patented prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, veterinary
pharmaceuticals, and agricultural and specialty chemicals. This proposal is part of an overall company cost reduction
effort (subzone status is being requested for seven other Merck facilities).

Merck's Riverside plant (364 acres, 650,000 sq. ft., 68 bldgs.) is located at First Street and Avenue C in Riverside
(Northumberland County), Pennsylvania, some 60 miles southwest of Scranton. The facility (560 employees) is used
to produce bulk pharmaceutical chemicals and intermediates used at other Merck plants in the manufacture of human
and animal health products, agricultural chemicals (including ``Avermectin'' and ``Ethopabate''), and industrial
chemicals. At the outset, zone procedures would be used primarily in the production of ``Primaxin'', a broad spectrum
antibiotic produced for the company's Human Health Division. Currently, foreign-sourced materials account for
33 to 43 percent of finished product value and include the following specific ingredients: Acetoxy azetidinone,
HP-20 resin dianon, SP-207 (brominated polystyrine resin), bromochloropentane, and D-carboxamide.
The company also may purchase from abroad items in the following general product categories: Gums, starches, waxes,
vegetable extracts, mineral oils, phosphoric acid, hydroxides, hydrazine and hydroxylamine, chlorides, phosphates,
carbonates, hydrocarbons, alcohols, phenols, ethers, epoxides, acetals, aldehydes, ketone function compounds,
mono- and polycarboxylic acids, phosphoric esters, amine-, carboxymide, nitrile- and oxygen-function compounds,
heterocyclic compounds, sulfonamides, vitamins, hormones, sugars, antibiotics, gelatins, enzymes, color lakes,
soaps and detergents, medicaments, and pharmaceutical products. The company may also source from abroad insecticides,
rodenticides, fungicides, and herbicides for use in its agricultural/veterinary products. Currently, exports
account for some 40 percent of production.

Zone procedures would exempt Merck from Customs duty payments on foreign materials used in production for export.
On domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to the finished products (``Primaxin''_3.7%;
others_duty-free to 23.5%). The duty rates on foreign-sourced items range from duty-free to 23.5 percent, with most
falling in the 3.7%-7.9% range. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures will help improve
the plant's international competitiveness. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate
the application and report to the Board.

Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the
Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is March 7, 1994. Rebuttal
comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day
period (to March 22, 1994).

The Department conducted verification of the cost and sales responses of Minasligas and CBCC in Brazil from August
25 through September 14, 1993. 



Petitioners, CBCC, and Minasligas submitted case briefs on October 27, 1993, and rebuttal briefs on November 1, 1993.




On November 3, 1993, a public hearing was held. 




Best Information Available 





As stated in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, Italmagnesio withdrew its responses prior to verification
and stated that it would not participate further in the investigation. Therefore, Italmagnesio must be considered
a non-cooperating party. As a non-cooperating party, based on our past practice (

see e.g.,

 58 FR 37215, 

Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Value, Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from the United Kingdom,

 July 9, 1993), Italmagnesio will be assigned the higher of the margins alleged in the petition or a calculated margin
for another company as best information available (BIA). (See Comment 15) 




Such or Similar Comparisons 





We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we compared
similar merchandise based on the following criteria: (1) The percentage range, by weight, of silicon content; (2)
grade; and (3) sieve size. (See Comment 2 with regard to sieve size.) 




Fair Value Comparisons 





To determine whether sales of FeSi from Brazil to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the
United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified below. 




United States Price 




A. CBCC 





We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and exporter's sales price was not indicated by
other circumstances. 



We calculated purchase price based on packed FOB port of embarkation prices to unrelated customers. Because CBCC
did not report packing for bulk sales, we used information from the public version of Minasligas' response for bulk
packing. We made deductions where appropriate for foreign inland freight (which also included foreign inland insurance),
foreign brokerage and handling, and warehousing. 



We made an adjustment to USP for the taxes paid on the comparison sales in Brazil. On October 7, 1993, the Court of International
Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v.

 United States,

 Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. 

Federal-Mogul,

 Slip Op. 93-194 at 12. 



The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 

Federal-Mogul

 decision, and has applied this new methodology in making the final determination in this investigation. From now
on, the Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States
merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales.
The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments will
deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included
in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise
price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments
to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the new methodology for calculating
the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied
upon foreign market sales. 



This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the
price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp. 

v.

 United States,

 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to
mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included
in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. 

v.

 United States,

 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo.

In this investigation, there are four different taxes levied on sales of the subject merchandise in the home market.
The ICMS tax is a regional tax, which varies depending upon the state in which the purchase originates. The IPI tax is
a fixed percentage rate tax of four percent. Finally, the PIS and FINSOCIAL taxes are a fixed percentage rate tax equalling
2.65 percent combined. CBCC used both a unit and a gross basis to calculate the combined PIS and FINSOCIAL taxes within
various months of the POI. We recalculated these taxes on a unit basis, where appropriate, which is the way CBCC calculated
them. Because these taxes are calculated on the same base price, we find them not to be cascading. Thus, for each sale,
we made only one tax adjustment which equals the sum of the actual tax rates. 




B. Minasligas 





We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and exporter's sales price was not indicated by
other circumstances. 



We calculated purchase price based on packed FOB port of embarkation prices to unrelated customers. We made deductions
where appropriate for foreign inland freight (which also included foreign inland insurance) and foreign brokerage
and handling. 



We made an adjustment to USP for the taxes paid on the comparison sale in Brazil. (See above description under ``A. CBCC

'' for an explanation of our new tax methodology as well as a description of the specific taxes in this investigation.)





Foreign Market Value 





In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of FeSi in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of FeSi to the aggregate volume of third country sales in accordance
with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. For both CBCC and Minasligas, the volume of home market sales was greater than
five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales. Therefore, for both CBCC and Minasligas, we determined
that home market sales of FeSi constituted a viable basis for calculating FMV, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a).




In the petition and in subsequent filings, petitioners alleged that home market sales were made at less than the cost
of production (COP) and that constructed value (CV) should be used to compute FMV. Based on petitioners' allegations,
which provided a reasonable basis to ``believe or suspect'' below cost sales (see section 773(b) of the ACT), we initiated
COP investigations. We examined respondents' cost data at verification and analyzed this information for purposes
of this final determination. 



We determine Brazil's economy to be hyperinflationary. Therefore, in order to eliminate the distortive effects
of inflation, consistent with past practice (see, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Amended Antidumping Duty Order, Tubeless Steel Disc
Wheels from Brazil, 

53 FR 34566, September 7, 1988), we calculated separate weighted-average FMVs, COPs, and CVs for each month. 




A. CBCC 





In order to determine whether home market sales were above the COP, we calculated the monthly COPs on the basis of CBCC's
cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and packing. We relied on the COP data submitted by CBCC except
in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. Specifically, we: 



1. Revised general and administrative (G&A) expenses by calculating them as a percentage of cost of goods sold
as reported on CBCC's 1992 financial statements (see Comment 4); 



2. Added an amount for the G&A expenses of CBCC's parent company (see Comment 4); 



3. Revised the interest expense computation using the financial statements of CBCC's parent, Solvay do Brasil (see
Comment 3); 



4. Included IPI and ICMS taxes as part of reported material costs in COP (see Comment 5); 



5. Recalculated the cost of CBCC's own production of charcoal based upon BIA (see Comment 6); 



6. Recalculated depreciation costs for Furnace 8 based upon a 10 year useful life (see Comment 7); 



7. Corrected an error in the October 1992 calculation of electricity cost (see Comment 9); 



8. Added packing expenses in COP for the home market and United States, respectively. 



We compared individual home market prices with the monthly COPs. We tested the home market prices on a sieve-size-specific
basis and found, for all sieve sizes, that between 10 and 90 percent of sales in the home market were made at prices above
the COP. Therefore, we disregarded the below-cost sales, if those sales were made over an extended period of time.
CBCC did not provide any information in its responses to indicate that its below cost sales were made at prices which
would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. In order to determine
whether below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis on a product-specific
basis: (1) If respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that month below the COP, or
(2) if respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below the COP during two or more
of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended period of time. All of CBCC's
sales were made over an extended period of time. 



For CBCC, we based FMV on home market prices. However, for one U.S. sale, although there were comparable home market
sales in the same month, we were unable to make a difference-in-merchandise (DIFMER) adjustment. This is because
the U.S. product was produced in a month different than the home market products and in hyperinflationary economies,
we limit such adjustments to products produced and sold in the same month. In that instance, we used CV as FMV.

We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e)(1) of the Act. The monthly CV includes materials, fabrication,
general expenses, profit and packing. We made all adjustments described in the COP section (except for the inclusion
of ICMS and IPI taxes in material costs) in calculating the CV. We used the following as the basis for calculating CV:

(1) CBCC's actual general expenses because they exceed the statutory ten percent minimum of materials and fabrication,
in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act; 
(2) the statutory minimum profit of eight percent, in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, as CBCC's
profit was less than eight percent of the sum of general expenses and the cost of manufacture; and 
(3) we calculated an offset to interest expense to avoid double counting the portion of such expense attributable
to the imputed credit and inventory carrying costs which were already included in the selling, general and administrative
expenses. 
We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a).
Finally, we added U.S. packing expenses to CV. 
For price-to-price comparisons, we based FMV on ex-factory prices, inclusive of packing, to unrelated customers.

We deducted foreign inland freight from FMV. We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for
differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). Because the home market credit figure reported
by CBCC is actually interest revenue, we imputed credit expense and then applied the interest revenue as an offset
against the imputed expense. We also used the actual paydates found at verification in our credit expense calculation.
For those sales which we did not examine at verification, we added the average difference between the paydate reported
and the actual paydate from the verified sales. 
For FeSi sales packed in bags, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. Because CBCC did
not report packing for bulk sales, we used information on bulk packing costs from the public version of Minasligas'
response for these sales. 
We included in the FMV the amount of taxes collected in the home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that
was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., the sum of any amounts that were deducted
from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. By
making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping margin even when pre-tax
dumping is zero. 


B. Minasligas 


In order to determine whether home market sales were above the COP, we calculated the monthly COPs on the basis of Minasligas'
cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and packing. We relied on the COP data submitted by Minasligas
except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. Specifically, we:

1. Revised G&A expenses by calculating them on an annual basis as a percentage of cost of goods sold as reported
in Minasligas' 1992 financial statements (see Comment 4); 
2. Revised interest expenses to include finance expenses of Delp (Minasligas' parent company), and disallowed a
portion of the claimed interest income offset (see Comment 3); 
3. Included IPI and ICMS taxes as part of reported material costs in COP (see Comment 5); 
4. Revised the labor and overhead allocation methodology to reflect production quantity (see Comment 14); 
5. Adjusted the inventory holding gains and losses to account for revisions in the reported costs (see Comment 10);

6. Disallowed the claimed differences in cost between high purity and standard grade FeSi and used the ``all kinds''
reported costs; 
7. Added packing expenses in COP for the home market and United States, respectively.

We compared individual home market prices with the monthly COPs. We tested the home market prices on a sieve-size-specific
basis and found, for certain sieve sizes, that between 10 and 90 percent of sales of each in the home market were made
at prices above the COP. Therefore, we disregarded the below-cost sales for those sieve sizes, if those sales were
made over an extended period of time. Minasligas did not provide any information in its responses to indicate that
its below cost sales were made at prices which would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time
in the normal course of trade. In order to determine whether below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time,
we performed the following analysis on a product-specific basis: (1) If respondent sold a product in only one month
of the POI and there were sales in that month below the COP, or (2) if respondent sold a product during two months or more
of the POI and there were sales below the COP during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered
to have been made over an extended period of time. All of Minasligas' below cost sales were made over an extended period
of time. 
For Minasligas, we based FMV on home market prices. We calculated FMV based on ex-factory prices, inclusive of packing,
to unrelated customers. We deducted foreign inland freight from FMV. We made circumstance-of-sale adjustments,
where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). Because the home market
credit figure reported by Minasligas is actually interest revenue, we imputed credit expense and then used the interest
revenue as an offset against the imputed expense. We imputed U.S. credit because Minasligas did not report this expense.
We used the ``First Payment'' date reported by Minasligas and the monthly interest rates based on the ``Taxa Referential''
which is the Brazilian Government's referential index for short-term borrowings. We also made circumstance-of-sale
adjustments, where appropriate, for direct selling expenses (finance charges), warehousing, and quality control
expenses. We reallocated a portion of direct selling expenses to foreign brokerage and handling based on findings
at verification. Finally, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. 
We included in FMV the amount of taxes collected in the home market. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was
due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., the sum of any adjustments that were
deducted from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been
made. By making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping margin even when
pre-tax dumping is zero. 


Critical Circumstances 


Petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of FeSi from Brazil. Section 735(a)(3)
of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determine that: 
(A) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or 
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and, 
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
Regarding (A)(i) above, we normally consider whether there has been an antidumping order in the United States or elsewhere
on the subject merchandise in determining whether there is a history of dumping. Regarding (A)(ii) above, we normally
consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price comparisons and 15 percent or more for exporter's sales price
comparisons as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping. 
Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have
been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable);
and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. If imports during the period immediately following
the filing of a petition increase by at least 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately preceding
the filing of a petition, we normally consider them massive. 
Since the calculated dumping margins for CBCC and Minasligas are not in excess of 25 percent, we cannot impute knowledge
under section 735(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act. (See, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or
Unfinished, from Italy, 

52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987.) Petitioners provided information regarding respondent's history of dumping in a third
country. Therefore, we examined whether imports have been massive. Based on our analysis of verified company specific
import data, we determined that imports have not been massive over a relatively short period of time for CBCC and Minasligas.
Accordingly, we determine that critical circumstances do not exist for CBCC and Minasligas. However, for Italmagnesio,
a non-cooperative respondent, based on BIA we determine that critical circumstances exist. In the case of Italmagnesio,
the margin in excess of 25 percent is high enough to impute knowledge of dumping and, as BIA, we concluded that imports
have been massive over a relatively short period of time. 
Because we found that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to all cooperative respondents, we also find
that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to all other exporters and producers of the subject merchandise
from Brazil, except for Italmagnesio. 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we conducted verification of the information provided by CBCC and Minasligas
by using standard verification procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records,
and selection of original source documentation containing relevant information.

Currency Conversion 



No certified rates of exchange, as furnished by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were available for the POI. In
place of the official certified rates, we used the daily official exchange rates for the Brazilian currency published
by the Central Bank of Brazil. In the instances when a post-POI exchange rate was required, we used a monthly average
exchange rate from International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics. 

In hyperinflationary economies, the Department normally converts movement charges for the U.S. sales on the date
these charges become payable. Where we did not have the exact payment date for a charge, we converted charges for U.S.
sales on the date of shipment, the closest approximation to the date the charges became payable. For two of CBCC's U.S.
sales, it was necessary to convert the bulk packing charges on the date of sale as we did not have a bulk packing rate in
the month of shipment for those U.S. sales. Thus, for these two sales we converted the packing charges in the same month
in which the U.S. sales occurred. 



Interested Party Comments 





Comment 1:

 Petitioners argue that, based on the facts now available to the Department, the dumping margins established in the
preliminary determination are inadequate to offset the actual dumping margin of Brazilian FeSi producers. In addition,
petitioners believe that at verification the Department confirmed the existence of major, continuing deficiencies
in respondents' information. Accordingly, petitioners contend that the Department should assign the highest,
most adverse margin based on noncooperative BIA to both CBCC and Minasligas. 



DOC Position:

 We disagree with petitioners. CBCC and Minasligas' mistakes, found during the course of this investigation, when
taken as a whole, do not represent a verification failure and do not support a claim of respondents' noncooperation.
The minor errors in calculation or discrepancies with regard to adoption of certain methodological premises do not
merit the use of BIA. Therefore, we have followed our practice of correcting errors found at verification as long as
those errors are minor and do not exhibit a pattern of systemic misstatement of fact. Thus, we are able to use the data
submitted by CBCC and Minasligas, corrected for errors noted at verification, in our calculations. 



Comment 2:

 Petitioners argue that the Department should use the highest, most adverse noncooperative BIA rate for CBCC and Minasligas
since they both repeatedly failed to provide the Department with the accurate sieve size and silicon content of the
FeSi they sold. Petitioners maintain that CBCC's August 17, 1993, letter contained information about silicon content
and sieve size known to be inaccurate. Petitioners contend that accurate information was clearly available to CBCC
and the fact that it was not provided prevented the Department from making such or similar comparisons in the final
determination, as required by the Act. Similarly, petitioners note that Minasligas, in its August 25, 1993, revised
product concordance, failed to provide the exact silicon content and sieve size of its home market sales. 

CBCC believes that the Department incorrectly based its preliminary determination on BIA because of the alleged
failure by CBCC to provide a proper product concordance. CBCC states that it cannot fabricate a product concordance
to the level of sieve size, which was requested by the Department, because there is no difference in product between
sieve sizes. CBCC argues that the Department verified that sieve size is irrelevant in terms of the cost and the price
and, thus, any DIFMER would be zero. CBCC maintains that based on the information submitted and the production processes
observed at verification, the Department should use CBCC's information as the basis for the final determination.


Similarly, Minasligas maintains that sieve size does not impact cost or price of FeSi and should not be considered
a factor for product comparison purposes. With respect to providing information on exact silicon content, Minasligas
contends that the ASTM standard specifications for FeSi 75 percent under grade C provide for a product containing
between 74 percent and 79 percent of silicon. Minasligas argues that since all of its FeSi sales are of FeSi 75 percent
the exact silicon content of the product within this range is irrelevant.

DOC Position:

 We agree with respondents. We determine that Minasligas provided a unique code for each sieve size for each sale during
the POI, in accordance with directions in Appendix V. We used Minasligas' product matching method for purposes of
margin calculation; however, we rematched in a few instances where we disagreed with their selection. We based matching
on home market sales with sieve size ranges which were closest to the sieve size range of the U.S. product. 

We also determine that CBCC reported sieve sizes in accordance with Appendix V. The sieve size ranges reported by CBCC
were broader than those reported by Minasligas and were broader than the ranges observed on CBCC's individual home
market sales. Nevertheless, these ranges do allow us to match within the closest sieve size range, as specified in
Appendix V. Moreover, these broad ranges are consistent with CBCC's selling practices. CBCC stated on the record
that it fills customer orders with the broadest range of possible sieve sizes. Therefore, we accepted CBCC's revised
coding system, and matched home market sales with all possible sieve sizes, including those that may extend beyond
the sieve size range of the U.S. product because this corresponds to CBCC's selling practices. We excluded from FMV
only those home market sales where the sieve size ranges are entirely outside the sieve size range of the U.S. sale in
question. (See Concurrence Memorandum dated December 29, 1993.) 

In addition, we also agree with respondents that reported silicon content ranges, within acceptable ASTM specifications,
are adequate. 



Comment 3:

 Petitioners claim that both CBCC and Minasligas failed to report their respective interest expenses on a consolidated
basis for the purposes of calculating COP in accordance with Department practice. Petitioners argue that CBCC's
refusal to provide this information prevented the Department from verifying these expenses. Accordingly, petitioners
state that the Department should use adverse, ``noncooperative BIA'' in calculating interest expense for CBCC.
However, in the event that the Department does not use ``noncooperative BIA,'' petitioners suggest that the Department
use Solvay do Brasil's audited financial statements to calculate interest expense for the purposes of calculating
CBCC's COP and CV. Similarly, petitioners contend that the Department should allocate interest expense to Minasligas'
COP based on Delp's (Minasligas' parent company) 1992 audited financial statements as a percentage of cost of goods
sold, without allowance for a short-term interest income offset. 

CBCC argues that the Department should use its non-consolidated income statement, rather than the corporate consolidated
figure, to compute net interest expense. CBCC claims that the advances of funds from subsidiary to parent were the
reverse of those normally seen by the Department and were not ``interest free''. CBCC further argues that without
CBCC, Solvay do Brasil would have had to borrow funds in the commercial market. Thus, CBCC suggests that the Department
should increase CBCC's financial receipts by an imputed interest on the interest free loans that CBCC made to its parent.
With regard to petitioners' allegation that CBCC refused to provide the Department with Solvay do Brasil's financial
statement, CBCC explains that the Department requested an additional copy of the translated financial statement,
previously submitted to the Department on June 10, 1993, which the company was unable to provide at verification.


Minasligas contends that its financial statements are not consolidated with Delp's statements. Minasligas maintains
that there is no borrowing relationship between Delp and Minasligas, and further, there is no evidence of control
by Delp over borrowings by Minasligas. Minasligas, therefore, believes it is inappropriate to substitute Delp's
interest expenses for that of Minasligas. Minasligas asserts that it correctly reduced its submitted unconsolidated
interest expenses by various forms of short-term financial income, including capital gains, exchange rate gains,
discounts, and monetary correction. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with petitioners that CBCC and Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. The Department's
position is that the cost of capital is fungible, therefore, calculating interest expense based on consolidated
statements is the most appropriate methodology. 

As discussed in the cost verification report of CBCC, we noted that CBCC and Solvay do Brasil rely on intercompany interest-free
borrowing to meet their working capital requirements. In addition, in order to extinguish its outstanding debt,
CBCC issued new shares of capital stock to its parent company. After establishing at verification that CBCC and Solvay
do Brasil have significant financial transactions with each other, we requested information documenting financial
expense at the Solvay do Brasil level. Company officials refused to provide any data. Therefore, we have based financial
expense for CBCC using BIA. As BIA, we used information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements (exhibit B; June
10, 1993, questionnaire response). This percentage was then applied to each month's COM. 

In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are
no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two
companies, effectively creating consolidated accounts. Regarding the offset claimed by Minasligas, the Department
only allows income generated from investments of working capital which the company documents as short-term in nature.
Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term; consequently, we have allowed
only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset to Minasligas' parent, Delp,
for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment is not contained in the
record of this investigation.

For both companies, in order to avoid overstating financing charges, we applied the interest expense ratio to each
month's COM calculated on a historical basis rather than amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. 


Comment 4: 

Petitioners maintain that CBCC and Minasligas failed to follow the Department's established practice for allocating
G&A expenses. Petitioners make the same allegation with regard to CBCC's selling expenses. Petitioners claim
that G&A expenses are period costs that should be allocated based on the ratio of total annual G&A expenses
over total annual costs of goods sold. Selling expenses should be allocated similarly. However, petitioners state
that CBCC allocated G&A and selling expenses to individual products, using the ratio of each separate product's
cost of goods sold. Minasligas allocated POI G&A expenses on a monthly basis. For purposes of the final determination,
petitioners believe that the Department should reallocate these expenses following its established practice.


CBCC argues that the Department should not use the ratio of expenses to cost of goods sold as an estimate of G&A expenses.
CBCC believes that the monthly expenses accurately reflect, on a replacement cost basis, the expenses for the company
in that month and are the most appropriate figures to use. CBCC claims that the petitioners are urging the Department
to use a methodology that the Court of International Trade specifically invalidated as susceptible to overstating
the effects of inflation. 

Minasligas agrees that G&A expenses are period costs, but maintains that an annual calculation based on cost
of sales is problematic because the annual G&A expense and the annual cost of sales are conglomerations of monthly
expenses which have not been adjusted for inflation. Minasligas believes the Department should calculate G&A
rates based on monthly averages or a simple average G&A rate. 



DOC Position:

 
We agree with petitioners in part. G&A expenses are period expenses which are normally measured over a fiscal
year. As such, the Department calculates G&A on an annual basis. To calculate G&A for a lesser period may exclude
certain expenses, which is distortive. Therefore, we recalculated G&A expenses on an annual historical basis
for both companies and, in order to avoid overstating G&A expenses and neutralize hyperinflationary effects,
we applied the G&A ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. We also revised CBCC's reported
G&A to include a portion of Solvay do Brasil's G&A, which CBCC had failed to include in its reported costs.
Moreover, we calculated CBCC's selling expense portion of SG&A based on sales of the same class or kind of merchandise
according to our normal practice. 



Comment 5:

 
Petitioners contend that the Department should include ICMS and IPI taxes in CBCC's and Minasligas' reported materials
costs in applying the Department's sales-below-cost test. Petitioners state that Department practice is to perform
the sales-below-cost test on a tax-inclusive basis, with the COP and home market prices containing the same absolute
amount of taxes. With regard to CV, petitioners contend that the Department has previously determined that ICMS and
other domestic taxes are not remitted or refunded upon exportation and consequently have to be included in CV. 
CBCC submits that the Department should not include the ICMS and IPI taxes in its COP and CV calculations. CBCC states
that the Department reviewed CBCC's records at verification showing that CBCC's payments of ICMS offset any amount
owed by virtue of its receipts of ICMS. Thus, CBCC claims that the ``cost of materials'' does not include any ICMS or
IPI value, because CBCC always receives a tax credit for these payments. 
Minasligas argues that in determining whether home market sales are above the cost of production, the Department
must either include ICMS and IPI in the cost of production and in the sales price to the domestic market or exclude them
from both sides to avoid double counting. Minasligas further argues that these taxes should not be included in calculations
of CV because they are offset against the amounts collected from the domestic market sales. 


DOC Position:

 
We agree with petitioners in part. For our test of home market sales below cost we have included the same amount of domestic
taxes in the COP and the domestic sales prices. However, when using CV as a surrogate for home market prices we must determine
if in fact the entity under investigation is able to recover all of the taxes paid on inputs (raw materials) from its
domestic sales of subject merchandise. If domestic sales of subject merchandise fully recover all of the domestic
taxes paid on inputs, then these taxes would appropriately be excluded from the margin analysis. However, if the producer
is not able to recover all input taxes from its sales of subject merchandise, then these actual costs must be reflected
in the CV. (See 

Camargo Correa Metais, S.A., 

v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-163, p. 19 (August 13, 1993). 
We have determined that CBCC's domestic sales of subject merchandise fully recover all input taxes incurred to produce
the subject merchandise sold in both the domestic and export markets. We have excluded the domestic tax amounts from
CV because the taxes paid are offset against the amounts which are collected on domestic sales which are rebated to
the government.

Comment 6:

 
Petitioners claim that CBCC did not accurately report its charcoal replacement costs. They further argue that CBCC
did not provide the Department with the additional documentation requested regarding the estimated harvest of wood
and other assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization costs for charcoal production. Petitioners argue
that by not providing this information, CBCC prevented the Department from verifying the accuracy of the cost data
and CBCC did not comply with Department practice in reporting replacement costs for company-produced charcoal.
Therefore, petitioners state that the Department should assign a noncooperative BIA rate to CBCC. Alternatively,
petitioners suggest that the Department adjust CBCC's reported cost for company-produced charcoal upward to the
level of CBCC's cost for purchasing charcoal from unrelated suppliers. 

CBCC argues that since charcoal accounts for less than three percent of the cost of production of FeSi, use of BIA because
of the difficulty encountered with verifying the accuracy of this factor of production would be totally inappropriate.
CBCC maintains that should the Department make any adjustments to the charcoal costs it should only adjust the figures
with the information gathered at verification rather than disregard the entire response. 



DOC Position:

 
We agree with petitioners that we should adjust CBCC's charcoal replacement costs; however, we disagree that CBCC
was noncooperative and should receive a margin based solely upon BIA. We discovered errors made by CBCC in calculating
its cost of producing charcoal, a primary raw material, used in the production of FeSi. CBCC substantially understated
its cost of producing charcoal by inaccurately recording the costs associated with their wood forests which provide
the raw material needed to produce charcoal. Therefore, we have recalculated the cost of CBCC's production of charcoal.
As suggested by petitioners, we relied upon the actual weighted-average monthly cost CBCC was charged by unrelated
vendors. 


Comment 7:

 
Petitioners claim that CBCC incorrectly accelerated the depreciation on a particular furnace by five years. The
result was a disproportionate allocation of costs to products manufactured during the first five years the furnace
was put into service, as opposed to the second five years, when no depreciation was reported. Petitioners contend
that the accelerated depreciation for this furnace was an abnormal event since CBCC returned to its normal ten-year
useful life for furnace depreciation following the period of accelerated depreciation. Petitioners further argue
that the Department has explicitly rejected the accelerated depreciation of assets where such accelerated depreciation
was not based on the useful life of the assets. Accordingly, petitioners believe that the depreciation charges for
this furnace should be recalculated to reflect the company's normal ten-year useful life for furnace depreciation.



DOC Position:

 
We agree with petitioners. We have recalculated depreciation expense for this furnace to reflect the amounts which
would have been recorded based upon CBCC's normal ten year amortization period since it is CBCC's normal practice
to employ a ten year useful life in calculating furnace depreciation charges. 



Comment 8:

 
Petitioners state that CBCC failed to accurately allocate furnace depreciation to FeSi based on the percentage of
total furnace capacity devoted to FeSi production. Accordingly, for purposes of the final determination, petitioners
contend that the Department should increase depreciation allocated to FeSi production for each month of the POI.

CBCC contends that it would be improper for the Department to allocate all of CBCC's depreciation expenses on all furnaces
to FeSi production. Although theoretically, any one furnace could be used to produce any of the products that CBCC
sells, this does not make the furnaces fungible. The Department's determination should not be based on what could
theoretically be produced in a furnace, but rather what was actually produced in each furnace. Regardless, if the
Department considers the furnaces fungible, this would result in a lowering of CBCC's depreciation expense as furnaces
one through six are fully depreciated. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with CBCC. Its methodology of matching furnace depreciation with the product actually produced in each furnace
is an acceptable methodology. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made for the final determination. 



Comment 9:

 Petitioners claim that at verification CBCC's reported consumption and cost of electricity attributed to FeSi were
understated for October 1992. Therefore, petitioners believe that the Department should increase these costs for
each month of the POI. 

CBCC maintains that the Department verified that only the month of October contained an error of 5.7 percent with respect
to the electricity consumption and cost; such error was incurred in transferring expenses from one cost report to
another. Thus, CBCC concedes only that the Department should adjust its October, 1992, electricity consumption
and cost by 5.7 percent, rather than making monthly adjustments. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with CBCC. At verification we established that this was an isolated error and not a methodological problem.
Accordingly, we have corrected the reported electrical consumption and cost for October 1992, only. 



Comment 10:

 Petitioners state that CBCC failed to properly calculate inventory holding gains/losses. Petitioners argue that
CBCC reported its input and finished product inventories on a first in first out (FIFO) basis, which is contrary to
Department practice. Furthermore, petitioners claim that CBCC provided no inventory holding gain/loss calculations
for iron ore. Accordingly, petitioners believe that the reported values cannot be relied on for purposes of the final
determination and the Department should apply BIA. 

CBCC maintains that it provided inventory gain/loss information according to the Department's methodology used
in the 

Final Determination Of Sales At Less Than Fair Value, Silicon Metal from Brazil

, 56 FR 26977, June 12, 1991, where the Department rejected CBCC's cost accounting method used in the normal course
of business, stating that it did not properly reflect the effects of inflation and used a FIFO basis to make the calculation.


With respect to the inventory holding gain/loss calculation for iron ore, the Department verified that CBCC maintains
no more than its immediate requirements in inventory. Thus, CBCC submitted no inventory holding gain/loss information
on this raw material because there is none. CBCC's monthly purchase of iron ore is consumed during that month. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with respondent. In reporting on a FIFO basis, CBCC followed prescribed Department practice. The Department
verified that CBCC had no gain or loss on the iron ore because it completely consumed its purchases in the same month
as production. 



Comment 11:

 Petitioners argue that Minasligas' U.S. sales of slag during the POI are within the scope of this investigation. Petitioners
base their argument on the petition's scope language, which they claim does not specifically exclude slag of the chemical
composition that Minasligas sold to the United States during the POI. Petitioners further argue that even if the slag
were not covered by the product description in the petition, it is within the scope under the criteria outlined in 

Diversified Products Corporation

 v. 

U.S.

, 572 F. Supp. 883 (CIT 1983) (``

Diversified Products

'') criteria. 

Conversely, Minasligas states that its U.S. sales of slag are not covered by the scope of this investigation. Minasligas
bases its argument on chemical analysis certificates provided at verification, which list chemical compositions
which Minasligas claims are sufficient to exclude the slag sales from the scope of the investigation. Specifically,
Minasligas argues that, according to the petition, the high levels of oxygen and calcium oxide present in these slag
sales places them outside the scope of the investigation. 



DOC Position:

 We agree that ferrosilicon in the form of slag can be included within the scope of investigation if it generally meets
the chemical content definition contained in the scope of this investigation and if it is capable of being used as FeSi.
(See 

Scope of Investigation

.) 

With regard to the two U.S. sales of FeSi slag made by Minasligas, we determine that these sales are within the scope
of the investigation based on information on the record indicating that the slag in question can be used as FeSi. Since
we do not have actual price or cost data for these two sales, we will assign an average of all margins calculated for Minasligas'
sales for which we have price and cost data. 



Comment 12:

 Petitioners argue that Minasligas failed to provide complete cost information requested by the Department in conjunction
with a previously unreported sale. Thus, petitioners argue that the Department should assign a ``noncooperative''
BIA margin for that U.S. sale. 

Minasligas maintains that it provided all necessary information relating to this sale. 



DOC Position:

 Since we used a price-to-price comparison for this sale, petitioners' points are moot.

Comment 13:

 Minasligas contends that the sale dates for certain U.S. sales falls outside the POI. Thus, Minasligas claims these
sales should be excluded from this investigation. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with respondent. Based on the sale dates reported and verified, these sales are outside the POI and are not
included in our margin calculation. 



Comment 14:

 Petitioners claim that Minasligas inappropriately allocated its labor and overhead costs between subject and non-subject
merchandise based on number of furnaces, rather than actual production during the POI. Therefore, petitioners request
that the Department adjust Minasligas' submitted costs accordingly. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with petitioners that number of furnaces is not an adequate basis for allocating labor or other fabrication
costs. Number of furnaces is an arbitrary measure, which does not necessarily reflect the actual level of labor and
overhead expended in the production of the subject merchandise. In the instant case, output tons is a more accurate
allocation basis. Therefore, we have revised the submitted costs to reflect an allocation based on actual production
units. 



Comment 15:

 Petitioners argue that Italmagnesio failed to cooperate with the Department by withdrawing from the investigation
and should receive the highest, most adverse BIA rate on the record. Petitioners further argue that BIA includes the
rates alleged in the petition, as corrected for clerical errors, and the rates alleged in petitioners' amended allegation
of sales below cost for Italmagnesio. Petitioners disagree with the Department's decision in the preliminary determination
which rejected the revised margin calculations in petitioners' amended sales-below-cost allegation as a source
of BIA; the Department rejected the revisions on the grounds that petitioners based the revisions on information
submitted by Italmagnesio. Petitioners state that their amended allegation relied not on financial statements
submitted by Italmagnesio but on identical financial statements that petitioners had obtained independently prior
to the date of Italmagnesio's submission of the information. In addition, petitioners assert that Italmagnesio
withdrew from the investigation after the Department indicated in the preliminary determination that it would not
use the higher rates in petitioners' amended allegation as BIA. Therefore, petitioners maintain that not using the
amended allegation as BIA would allow Italmagnesio to control the outcome of the investigation. 



DOC Position:

 For this final determination, we assigned Italmagnesio a margin in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology
under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate or otherwise
significantly impede the proceeding. In our BIA margin analysis, we utilized information contained in petitioners'
amended COP allegation for Italmagnesio. Although Department policy does not allow petitioners to use questionnaire
responses in a piece-meal manner in order to increase margins in the petition that may later be used as BIA, our analysis
revealed that petitioners had access to Italmagnesio's financial statements prior to the submission of this information
on the record by Italmagnesio. 



Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 735(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to retroactively
suspend liquidation of all entries of FeSi from Italmagnesio. Retroactive suspension applies to entries of FeSi,
that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 18, 1993, which is the date 90 days prior
to the date of the publication of our preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. We are also directing the Customs Service to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation with regard to
CBCC, and ``All Other Exporters'' entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption between May 18, 1993, and
August 16, 1993, which is the date of our preliminary determination, and to release any bond or other security, and
refund any cash deposit with respect to these entries during that period in accordance with section 735(c)(3). For
CBCC and ``All Other Exporters'', we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of FeSi
from Brazil, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 16, 1993. Finally,
since the Department finds that no final dumping margin exists with respect to Minasligas, we are directing the Customs
Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation for entries of FeSi from Minasligas, and to release any bond or
other security, and refund any cash deposit with respect to these entries from Minasligas in accordance with section
735(c)(2) of the statute. However, if the Department has reasonable cause to believe or suspect at any time during
the existence of the antidumping duty order that Minasligas has sold or is likely to sell the subject merchandise to
the United States at less than its foreign market value, then the Department may institute an administrative review
of Minasligas under section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. 

The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which the
FMV of the subject merchandise exceeds the USP as shown below. 





ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. 



Notification to Interested Parties 



This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) in this investigation
of their responsibility covering the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. 

This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)) and 19 CFR 353.20(b)(2).

<DOCTITLE>Certain Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe and Tube Fittings </DOCTITLE>
From Japan, Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration/Department of Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request from the petitioner, Flowline Division of Markovitz Enterprises, Inc. (Flowline), the Department
of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain stainless
steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings (SSPFs) from Japan. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, Benkan
Corporation (Benkan), and exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period from March 1,
1992, through February 28, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for the period. 



As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference
between the United States price (USP) and foreign market value (FMV). Interested parties are invited to comment on
these preliminary results.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 12, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' (58 FR
13583) of the antidumping duty order on SSPFs from Japan (53 FR 9787). On March 29, 1993, Flowline requested an administrative
review. The Department initiated the review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960), covering the period March 1, 1992, through
February 28, 1993. The Department has now conducted this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of
1930, as amended (the Act). 



Scope of the Review 



The products covered by this review include certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings. These fittings
are used in piping systems for chemical plants, pharmaceutical plants, food processing facilities, waste treatment
facilities, semiconductor equipment applications, nuclear power plants, and other areas. 

This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 7307.23.0000.
The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written product description remains dispositive.


This review covers sales and entries by Benkan of the subject 
merchandise during the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



For Benkan, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Act, the Department established the following criteria for matching
sales in the home and U.S. markets: Type of fitting, seam condition, steel material grade, unit product weight within
10 percent, nominal pipe size, and wall thickness. An identical pipe is one that matches all of these criteria. A similar
pipe is one that has one or more differences in these discrete criteria from the U.S. fitting other than the type of fitting,
seam condition, and unit product weight within 10 percent. The 10 percent variance in unit product weight reflects
our prior practice in this case which was based upon allowable deviations between Japanese and U.S. industry standards.
The Department established this hierarchy of criteria after soliciting comments from Flowline and Benkan at the
beginning of the 1992-1993 review period. Both Flowline and Benkan agreed on the criteria and their hierarchy.




United States Price 



In calculating USP, the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because the merchandise
was sold to an unrelated purchaser in the United States prior to its importation and exporter's sales price was not
indicated by other circumstances. The Department based USP on the packed, delivered price to those unrelated purchasers.


The Department has determined that the date of sale for this merchandise is the invoice date because the invoice always
sets forth agreed prices and quantities and represents the first transactional document which systematically records
agreed prices. The Department made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, U.S. inland freight,
U.S. duties, U.S. brokerage fees, ocean freight, marine insurance, foreign brokerage fees, and discounts. 

On October 7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company 

v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales. 

Federal-Mogul, 

Slip Op. 93-194 at 12.

The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 

Federal-Mogul

 decision. The Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the merchandise
sold in the United States at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign
market sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments
will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are
included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise
price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments
to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating
the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied
upon foreign market sales. 
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the
price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp.

 v. 

United States,

 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to
mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included
in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States

, 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo

. 


Foreign Market Value 


In calculating FMV, we used home market price, as defined in section 773(a) of the Act. Home market price was based on
a packed, delivered price to unrelated purchasers in the home market. In accordance with section 353.45 of the Department's
regulations, the Department has excluded sales to related parties because the respondent has failed to provide sufficient
evidence to support its claim that sales to related parties were at arm's-length. The Department made adjustments,
where applicable, for inland freight, discounts, rebates, and for differences in packing material, packing labor,
and credit. 
The Department also made an adjustment to FMV for imputed consumption taxes in accordance with the aforementioned


Federal-Mogul

 decision. 
Additionally, where similar home market sales were used due to the absence of an identical sale, we made a difference-in-merchandise
adjustment. The Department based the difference-in-merchandise adjustment on differences in steel pipe materials
cost between U.S. and home market merchandise (see the Department's preliminary analysis memo dated December 29,
1993). When there were no contemporaneous such or similar sales, we based FMV on constructed value. Constructed value
data for specific models was provided by Benkan at the request of the Department. Benkan did not provide constructed
value information for two models as requested by the Department. For these preliminary results the Department has
applied to applicable sales of these two models an antidumping duty margin of 8.05967 percent which is the weighted
average margin for sales of SSPFs by Benkan for this review. The Department will request for the final results of this

Preliminary Results of Review 


As a result of our comparison of USP to FMV, the Department preliminarily determines that a margin of 8.06 percent exists
for Benkan for the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. 
Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a
hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication
of this notice, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may
be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments,
limited to the issues raised in the case briefs and comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication.
The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis
of any such written comments or hearing. 
The Department shall determine, and U.S. Customs shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual
differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions directly to Customs. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company
will be that rate established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for merchandise exported by
manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in a previous review or the original less-than-fair-value
(LTFV) investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the rate published in the most recent final results
or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is
not a firm covered in this review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash
deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in these final results of review, earlier
reviews, or the original investigation, whichever is the most recent; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will be 49.31
percent, as explained below. 
On May 25, 1993, the CIT, in 

Floral Trade Council

 v.

 United States,

 Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. Accordingly,
the cash deposit rate for any future entries from all other manufacturers or exporters, who are not covered in this
or prior administrative reviews and who are unrelated to the reviewed firms or any previously reviewed firm, will
be the ``all others'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation which is 49.31 percent. 
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<USBUREAU>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</USBUREAU>





Public Service Company of Colorado; Intent To Prepare a Joint Environmental Assessment and Conduct Public Scoping
Meetings and Site Visit 


December 30, 1993. 


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicense of the existing Salida
Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 2275-001. The project is located on the South Arkansas River and on Fooses Creek
in Chaffee County, Colorado, and occupies lands within the San Isabel National Forest. 
The FERC staff, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA)
on this hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. 
The EA will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. 
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. 


Scoping Meetings 


Two scoping meetings will be conducted on January 27, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will be
conducted at 10 a.m. at the Salida Ranger District office, 325 West Rainbow Boulevard, Salida, Colorado. A scoping
meeting oriented towards the public will be conducted at 7 p.m. at the Chaffee County Courthouse, Commissioners Meeting
Room, 142 Crestone Street, Salida, Colorado. 
Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the
staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. 
To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA will
be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also
be available at the scoping meetings. 


Objectives 


At the scoping meetings the FERC staff will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed
project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3)
identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the
staff's preliminary views. 


Procedures 


The meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the
formal record of the Commission proceedings on the Salida Hydroelectric Project. Individuals presenting statements
at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record. 
Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying and issues to be addressed in the EA. 
Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments
may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC
20426, until February 28, 1994. 
All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Salida Hydroelectric Project,
FERC Project No. 2275-001. 
Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular
resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency. 


Site Visit 


A site visit to the Salida Project is planned for January 26, 1994. Those who wish to attend should plan to meet at the
Salida No. 2 powerhouse at 9 a.m. or contact Charlie Medina, District Ranger, at (719) 539-3591 for details.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``CERCLA''), notice is hereby given that a proposed
administrative cost recovery settlement concerning the Martin Marietta site in Waterton, Colorado was signed by
the EPA Regional Administrator, Region VIII, and issued by the Agency on July 2, 1993. The settlement resolves an EPA
claim under section 107 of CERCLA against the Martin Marietta Corporation (``MMC''). By the terms of the proposed
Agreement, MMC will pay $875,592.92 to EPA to settle its liability for remaining Past Response Costs. In return, the
United States will provide MMC with a covenant not to sue limited to claims for civil liability to the United States
arising out of section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), for reimbursement of the United States' Past Response
Costs. ``Past Response Costs'' are defined in the Agreement as any and all response costs, including oversight costs,
incurred by the United States in responding to the release or threat of release of hazardous substances from the Site
pursuant to CERCLA prior to and including the effective date of the Agreement, and any and all response costs, including
oversight, incurred pursuant to Administrative Order on Consent, In the Matter of: Martin Marietta Corporation,
Docket Nos. CERCLA 106 VIII-86-2 and RCRA (3008) VIII-86-01. The $875,592.92 figure represents
approximately 91 percent of the total amount of Past Response Costs incurred by the United States.



For thirty (30) days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments relating
to the settlement. The Agency's response to any comments received will be available for public inspection at the Superfund

<DOCTITLE>The Sumitomo Bank, Limited; Application To Engage in Certain Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, Osaka, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and section 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23), for approval
to engage through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sumitomo Bank Securities, Inc., New York, New York (Company), in underwriting
and dealing in, to a limited extent, certain municipal revenue bonds, 1-4 family mortgage-related securities, consumer
receivable-related securities, and commercial paper. Applicant proposes to conduct the activities on a world-wide
basis.


Closely Related to Banking Standard


Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``that the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto''. In determining whether a
proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 

inter alia

, the matters set forth in National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 516 F.2d
1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are:
(1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services,
(2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services
as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services; and
(3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require
their provision in a specialized form. 

See

 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable
or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. 

Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y

, 49 FR 806 (1984). 
Applicant maintains that the Board previously has determined by order that the proposed activities, when conducted
within the limitations established by the Board, are closely related to banking and consistent with section 20 of
the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377). 

See, e.g., Citicorp

, 
73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987), 

aff'd sub nom. Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

, 839 F.2d 47 (2d Cir. 1988), 

cert. denied

, 486 U.S. 1059 (1988); 

Order Approving Modifications to the Section 20 Orders

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989); 

The Sanwa Bank, Limited

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 568 (1990); 

Order Approving Modifications to the Section 20 Orders

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 226 (1993); and 

Supplement to Order Approving Modifications to Section 20 Orders

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 360 (1993). 


Proper Incident to Banking Standard 


In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and result in greater convenience
to Applicant's customers. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse
effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or
unsound banking practices, and that Company will conduct the proposed activities in accordance with prudential
limitations designed to safeguard against such potential adverse effects that have been relied upon by the Board
in similar previous cases. 

See, e.g., Citicorp, supra; The Sanwa Bank, Limited, supra.

 In this regard, Applicant has requested that one of the prudential limitations be modified to permit one officer or
one director of one of its United States banking affiliates to serve as a director of Company, a modification which
Applicant maintains is consistent with prior Board actions. 

See, e.g., Synovus Financial Corp., et al.

, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 954 (1991).
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application,
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than January 26, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by section 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)),
be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected
at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission announces the revised thresholds for interlocking directorates required by the 1990
amendment of section 8 of the Clayton Act. Section 8 prohibits, with certain exceptions, one person from serving as
a director or officer of two competing corporations if two thresholds are met. Competitor corporations are covered
by section 8 if each one has capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating more than $10,000,000, with the exception
that no corporation is covered if the competitive sales of either corporation are less than $1,000,000. Section 8(a)(5)
requires the Federal Trade Commission to revise those thresholds annually, based on the change in gross national
product. The new thresholds, which take effect immediately, are $12,092,000 for section 8(a)(1), and $1,209,200
for section 8(a)(2)(A).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Deputy Commissioner for Operations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is denying a request for a hearing
and issuing a final order under section 306(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 335a(a))
permanently debarring Mr. David J. Brancato, 13010 Atlantic Ave., Rockville, MD 20851, from providing services
in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding
that Mr. Brancato was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval,
including the process for development or approval of a drug product; and relating to the regulation of a drug product
under the act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


David J. Brancato, a former review chemist with FDA's Division of Generic Drugs, pled guilty and was sentenced on January
5, 1990, for receiving unlawful gratuities, a felony offense under 18 U.S.C. 201(c)(1)(B). This conviction was based
on Mr. Brancato's acceptance of payment of approximately $4,300 from senior officials of generic drug manufacturers,
Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Par), and its subsidiary, Quad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Quad), while Mr. Brancato was involved
in the regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products and while he was specifically responsible for reviewing Par's
and Quad's applications to determine whether those applications met certain statutory standards for approval.

On December 12, 1992, Mr. Brancato received a certified letter from the Deputy Commissioner for Operations offering
Mr. Brancato an opportunity for a hearing on the agency's proposal to issue an order under section 306(a) of the act
debarring him from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application.
FDA based the proposal to debar Mr. Brancato on its finding that he was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct
relating to the development, approval, and regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products. 
The certified letter further informed Mr. Brancato that his request for a hearing could not rest upon mere allegations
or denials but must present specific facts showing that there was a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring
a hearing. The letter also notified Mr. Brancato that if it conclusively appeared from the face of the information
and factual analyses in his request for a hearing that there was no genuine and substantial issue of fact which precluded
the order of debarment, FDA would enter summary judgment against him and deny his request for a hearing. 
In a letter dated December 21, 1992, Mr. Brancato requested a hearing and submitted arguments and information in support
of his hearing request. In his request for a hearing, Mr. Brancato acknowledges that he was convicted of a felony under
Federal law as alleged by FDA; however, he argues that FDA's findings are incorrect and that the agency's proposal
to debar him is unconstitutional.

The Deputy Commissioner for Operations has considered Mr. Brancato's arguments and concludes that they are unpersuasive
and fail to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing. The legal arguments that Mr. Brancato
offers do not create a basis for a hearing because hearings are not granted on matters of policy or law, but only on genuine
and substantial issues of fact (see 21 CFR 12.24(b)(1)). Additionally, the material submitted in support of Mr. Brancato's
hearing request does not justify a hearing because hearings will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations, denials,
or general descriptions of positions and contentions (see 21 CFR 12.24(b)(2)). Moreover, all of Mr. Brancato's arguments
are unconvincing for the reasons discussed below. 



II. Conclusions of the Deputy Commissioner Concerning 
Mr. Brancato's Arguments in Support of a Hearing 



A. Mandatory Debarment of Individuals Applies Retroactively to 
Convictions Occurring Within the Past 5 Years 



Mr. Brancato first alleges that the debarment provisions do not apply to conduct which occurred prior to the effective
date of the act. Mr. Brancato does not support this claim with further argument. 

The provision of the act applicable to Mr. Brancato is section 306(a)(2) of the act. Initiation of debarment proceedings
under that section is not limited by when the conduct underlying the conviction occurred, but rather, by when the conviction
occurred. Under section 306(a)(2) of the act, debarment proceedings must be initiated within 5 years of the conviction
(see section 306(l)(2) of the act). Debarment of Mr. Brancato is appropriately based upon his January 5, 1990, conviction,
occurring less than 4 years ago. Because the 5-year statute of limitations has not expired, Mr. Brancato's argument
fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 

It is unclear from Mr. Brancato's first argument whether he intended to further allege that the debarment provisions
do not apply retroactively to convictions occurring prior to the effective date of the act. Nevertheless, this issue
is addressed below. 

Congress intended section 306(a)(2) of the act to be retroactive as evidenced by comparing section 306(a)(2) of the
act, applicable to mandatory debarment of individuals, to section 306(a)(1) of the act, applicable to mandatory
debarment of corporations. The act treats corporations differently from individuals with respect to retroactivity.
Mandatory debarment of corporations under section 306(a)(1) of the act is not retroactive because debarment of corporations
is explicitly limited to convictions occurring ``after the date of enactment.'' Conversely, section 306(a)(2)
of the act, pertaining to mandatory debarment of individuals, does not contain any such limiting language. The exclusion
of language barring retroactivity for section 306(a)(2) implies that section 306(a)(2) of the act was intended by
Congress to be implemented retroactively. 

In addition, section 306(l)(2) of the act shows that section 306(a)(2), pertaining to mandatory debarment of individuals,
was intended to be retroactive. Section 306(l)(2) of the act sets out the effective dates for each provision of the
act. As noted above, the effective dates pertaining to section 306(a)(2) of the act state that any relevant conviction
may be used as the basis for mandatory debarment of individuals, so long as the conviction occurred no more than 5 years
prior to the initiation of debarment proceedings. Section 306(l) of the act states that certain other debarment provisions
shall not be retroactive by limiting application of those provisions to actions occurring on or after June 1, 1992.
Thus, where Congress intended a section not to be retroactive, it provided an effective date in section 306(l) of the
act. The omission of an effective date for section 306(a) of the act and the inclusion of an effective date for other
sections reveals Congress' intent that this section be retroactive. 

Thus, as intended by Congress, and as supported by the explicit language of the act, mandatory debarment applies retrospectively
and, thus, mandatory debarment applies to 
Mr. Brancato's conviction, which occurred within 5 years prior to the effective date of the act. Accordingly, Mr.
Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 



B. The Decision To Debar Mr. Brancato Was Based Upon the 
Relevant Considerations and Was Made by an Authorized Designee of the Secretary 



Mr. Brancato next argues that notice to him of his proposed debarment does not reflect consideration by the Secretary
of Health and Human Services or his designee. Mr. Brancato does not support this claim with facts or further argument.

Sections 201 through 903 of the act (21 U.S.C. 321 through 394) contain numerous grants of authority to the Secretary
of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). The Secretary has, in general, delegated this authority
to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs with authority to redelegate to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations and other
officers of FDA (see 21 CFR 5.10 and 5.20). The authority conferred in section 306 of the act is delegated to the Commissioner,
even though the legislation formally names the Secretary. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the
Deputy Commissioner for Operations (21 CFR 5.20(b) and 5.20(g)(1)). 

The notice of proposed debarment and opportunity for a hearing letter received by Mr. Brancato on December 12, 1992,
was issued legally under authority delegated to FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Operations. 

The decision to propose debarment of Mr. Brancato was appropriately based upon the following relevant considerations:
(1) The nature of the conviction (a felony under Federal law) and (2) the conduct underlying the conviction (conduct
relating to the development, approval, and regulation of Par's and Quad's drug products) (see section I. of this document).
Because the Deputy Commissioner for Operations, an authorized designee of the Secretary, considered the relevant
factors in making the determination to propose debarment, Mr. Brancato's claim that the notice of his proposed debarment
does not reflect consideration by the Secretary or his designee fails to raise any issue as to the validity of this proceeding
and fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 



C. Mr. Brancato's Conviction Subjects Him to the Mandatory Debarment Provisions Not to the Permissive Debarment
Provisions 



Mr. Brancato further contends that the conduct for which he was convicted is more appropriately conduct subject to
permissive debarment under 21 U.S.C. 306(b)(2)(B) of the act rather than to mandatory debarment. Mr. Brancato fails
to support this statement with an explanation or further argument. 

Section 306(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B) of the act mandates that FDA debar an individual if the Secretary finds that the
individual has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct: (1) Relating to the development or approval,
including the process for development or approval, of any drug product; and (2) otherwise relating to the regulation
of any drug product under the act. 

As discussed above, Mr. Brancato's conviction for receiving unlawful gratuities triggers the section 306 (a)(2)
(A) and (a)(2)(B) of the act mandatory debarment provisions. An individual convicted of this crime will not be considered
a candidate for permissive debarment unless FDA finds that the conduct underlying the conviction did not relate to
the development or approval, or the regulation of any drug product (see section 306(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the act). Absent
such a finding, mandatory debarment based upon such a conviction must follow. Because FDA finds that the conduct which
served the basis for Mr. Brancato's conviction did relate to the development and approval and the regulation of Par's
and Quad's drug products, the mandatory provisions, rather than the permissive provisions, are applicable in this
case. Mr. Brancato acknowledges that he was convicted of a felony under Federal law. Furthermore, he does not dispute
FDA's finding that the conduct underlying his conviction relates to the development and approval and the regulation
of Par's and Quad's drug products. Therefore, Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue
of fact. 



D. The Statutory Criteria Pertaining to Permissive Debarment Are Not Relevant to Mr. Brancato's Mandatory Debarment
Action 



Mr. Brancato states the following: (1) There is no evidence that the Secretary considered the statutory criteria
for determining appropriateness and period of debarment for nonmandatory (permissive) debarment, (2) Mr. Brancato
took voluntary steps to mitigate the impact of his offense on the public, and (3) Mr. Brancato has no prior convictions.
Mr. Brancato fails to support these three statements with further argument. 

As discussed, the mandatory debarment provisions, not the permissive debarment provisions, apply in this case.
The criteria pertaining to permissive debarment, which include evidence of mitigation and prior convictions, may
not be considered in making the decision to initiate mandatory debarment proceedings. Because Mr. Brancato argues
for the consideration of irrelevant permissive debarment criteria, not applicable to Mr. Brancato's mandatory
debarment action, his claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 



E. Mr. Brancato's Plea Agreement With the Government Does Not Preclude His Debarment 



In his next argument, Mr. Brancato states that his guilty plea and cooperation with the government were predicated
on the assumption that no civil penalties would flow from his cooperation and that debarment would render his guilty
plea subject to collateral attack and jeopardizes the integrity of the judicial process. He does not support this
claim with evidence or citations.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Mr. Brancato's claim is completely unsubstantiated. The April 13, 1989, plea agreement represents the complete
and final embodiment of Mr. Brancato's and the government's intention; the agreement explicitly states that ``[t]here
are no other agreements, promises, undertakings or understandings between 
Mr. Brancato and this Office.'' Contrary to Mr. Brancato's ``assumption,'' the terms of the plea agreement do not
preclude subsequent civil or administrative actions, including debarment. The terms bar only subsequent criminal
action. Because the plea agreement is the complete and final expression of the compromise between Mr. Brancato and
the government, and because the agreement does not preclude debarment, Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine
and substantial issue of fact. 



F. Debarment of Mr. Brancato Is Not Prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause 



In his final argument, Mr. Brancato states, ``individuals who cooperate with the government should not be subject
to sanctions of this kind 

ex post facto

.'' Mr. Brancato fails to support this statement with an explanation or case citation. 

Although it is unclear from this statement what point Mr. Brancato is attempting to make, two separate arguments may
be implied: That his cooperation exempts him from the debarment provisions, and that his debarment violates the ex
post facto clause of the United States Constitution. Both arguments are discussed individually below. 

As discussed above, the mandatory debarment provisions, not the permissive debarment provisions, apply in this
case. Cooperation with the government may not be considered in the decision to initiate mandatory debarment proceedings.
(Cooperation may, however, be considered in determining whether to grant special early termination of debarment,
under section 306(d)(4)(C) of the act, to individuals and as evidence of mitigation, in determining appropriateness
and period of permissive debarment.) Because Mr. Brancato's cooperation is immaterial here, his claim fails to raise
a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 

Mr. Brancato further suggests that the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits application of section
306(a)(2) of the act to him because this section was not in effect at the time of Mr. Brancato's criminal conduct. Section
306(a)(2) of the act was enacted on May 13, 1992. The conduct underlying Mr. Brancato's conviction occurred in 1987,
and his conviction occurred in 1990. 

An ex post facto law is one which punishes acts occurring prior to enactment of the law, or which adds a new punishment
to one that was in effect when the crime was committed. (

Ex Parte Garland,

 4 Wall. 333, 377, 18 L. Ed. 366 (1866). 

Collins 

v. 

Youngblood,

 110 S.Ct. 2715 (1990).) Retroactive application of a law to serve a remedial purpose does not violate the ex post facto
clause. 

Because debarment is intended as a remedy, rather than a punishment, retroactive application of the mandatory debarment
provisions of the act is not prohibited by the ex post facto clause. 

Debarment was clearly intended to be remedial. Congress created the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 (GDEA) in
response to findings of fraud and corruption in the generic drug industry. Both the language of the GDEA itself and
its legislative history reveal that the purpose of the debarment provisions is remedial: ``to restore and ensure
the integrity of the ANDA approval process and to protect the public health'' (see section 1, Pub. L. 102-282,
(GDEA)). A statement by Senator Hatch supports the remedial character of debarment as follows: ``* * *
[t]he legislation * * * provides a much-needed 

remedy

 for the blatant fraud and corruption uncovered in the generic drug industry * * * during the last 3 years.''
(Emphasis added.) (See Congressional Record, April 10, 1992, at S 5616.) 

It is well established by the Supreme Court that statutes which deny future privileges to convicted offenders because
of their previous criminal activities in order to ensure against corruption in specified areas do not impose penalties
for past conduct and, therefore, do not violate the ex post facto prohibitions (see, e.g., 

Hawker 

v. 

New York,

 170 U.S. 189, 190 (1898) (physician barred from practicing medicine for a prior felony conviction); 

DeVeau 

v. 

Braisted,

 373 U.S. 154 (1960)). 

In 

DeVeau,

 the Court upheld a law that prohibited a convicted felon from employment as an officer in a waterfront union. The purpose
of the law was to remedy the past corruption and to ensure against future corruption in the waterfront unions. The Court
in 

DeVeau,

 363 U.S. at 160, stated:




The question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct,
is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual
comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation, such as the proper qualifications for a profession
* * *.




As in 

DeVeau,

 the legislative purpose of the relevant statute is to ensure that fraud and corruption are eliminated from the generic
drug industry. The restrictions placed on individuals convicted of a felony under Federal law are not intended as
punishment but are ``incident to a regulation of a present situation'' (

DeVeau,

 363 U.S. at 160) and are necessary in order to remedy the past fraud and corruption in the industry. 

The legislative history is replete with statements that the GDEA provides the reasonable means needed to eliminate
the widespread corruption in the generic drug industry and to restore consumer confidence in generic drugs. Because
debarment is a remedial action, rather than one intended to punish, debarment does not violate the ex post facto clause
and Mr. Brancato's claim fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. 

In conclusion, Mr. Brancato has raised no genuine and substantial issue of fact regarding his conviction. He acknowledges
his conviction as alleged by FDA in the agency proposal to debar him. In addition, Mr. Brancato's legal arguments do
not create a basis for a hearing and, in any event, are unpersuasive. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations
denies Mr. Brancato's request for a hearing.

III. Findings and Order 


Therefore, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations, under section 306(a) of the act, and under authority delegated
to her (21 CFR 5.20), finds that Mr. Brancato has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct: (1) Relating
to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(A));
and (2) relating to the regulation of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(B)). 
As a result of the foregoing findings, Mr. Brancato is permanently debarred from providing services in any capacity
to a person with an approved or pending drug product application under sections 505, 507, 512, or 802 of the act (21 U.S.C.
355, 357, 360b, or 382), or under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), effective on January
6, 1994 (21 U.S.C. 335a(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2)(A)(ii) and 21 U.S.C. 321(ee)). 
Any person with an approved or pending drug product application who knowingly uses the services of Mr. Brancato in
any capacity, during his period of debarment, will be subject to civil money penalties (21 U.S.C. 335b(a)(6)). If
Mr. Brancato, during his period of debarment, provides services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending
drug product application, he will be subject to civil money penalties (21 U.S.C. 335b(a)(7)). In addition, FDA will
not accept or review any abbreviated new drug application or abbreviated antibiotic drug application submitted
by or with Mr. Brancato's assistance during his period of debarment. 
Mr. Brancato may file an application to attempt to terminate his debarment, pursuant to section 306(d)(4)(A) of the
act. Any such application would be reviewed under the criteria and processes set forth in section 306(d)(4)(C) and
(d)(4)(D) of the act. Such an application should be identified with Docket No. 92N-0416 and sent to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). All such submissions are to be filed in four copies. The public availability of
information in these submissions is governed by 21 CFR 10.20(j). Publicly available submissions may be seen in the
Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Guideline Regarding Microbiological Testing for Antimicrobial Food-Animal Drugs; Availability </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a proposed guideline entitled ``Microbiological
Testing of Antimicrobial Drug Residues in Food'' prepared by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regarding
the tests required for food-animal antimicrobial drug products to establish their human-food safety. This proposed
guideline provides criteria for determining which antimicrobials will require supplemental testing, and recommends
test procedures that are necessary to ensure that antimicrobial residues will not cause intestinal microflora perturbations
in the consumer. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is announcing the availability of a proposed guideline entitled ``Microbiological Testing of Antimicrobial
Drug Residues in Food'' regarding required testing for food-animal antimicrobial drug products. In evaluating
new animal drug applications (NADA's) the agency must determine, among other factors, the safety of the intended
use of the drug, including the cumulative effect on man or animal required by section 512(d)(2)(B) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(2)(B)). The proposed guideline provides criteria that will be
used to determine which antimicrobial drugs will require supplemental testing to ensure that antimicrobial residues
will not cause intestinal microflora perturbations in the consumer exposed to antimicrobial residues.



 It is well known that therapeutic doses of antibiotics can cause adverse effects on the intestinal microflora ecology.
In most cases the lowest dose at which these perturbations occur have not been determined; however, CVM believes that
the ecology of the human intestinal microflora should not be disturbed by the residues of antimicrobials used in food-animals.


 In June 1992, CVM sponsored a symposium on the Microbiological Significance of Drug Residues in Food to evaluate scientific
expertise in this area. Information discussed at the symposium reaffirmed CVM's conclusion that the residue antimicrobial
activity is a valid endpoint for establishing residue tolerances for antimicrobial animal drugs. 

 CVM proposes establishing two categories for antimicrobial drugs: (1) ``New Animal Antimicrobial Drugs Requiring
Additional Human Food Safety Microbiological Testing'' and (2) ``New Animal Antimicrobial Drugs Exempt from Additional
Human Food Safety Microbiological Testing.'' To qualify for exemption from additional microbiological testing,
the antimicrobial drug must have either: (1) ``Very low'' residue levels, (2) residues with limited antimicrobial
activity, or (3) no adverse effects on intestinal microflora at approved dosages. Antimicrobial drugs will require
additional testing in cases where a safe residue concentration retains antimicrobial activity in humans at residue
exposure levels greater than 1 part per million in the total diet.

 CVM requests comments regarding how the proposed guideline should relate the effects of low doses of antibiotics
observed in model systems to potential adverse biological effects in humans. In addition, information is requested
on the appropriate endpoints for monitoring the effects of the different classes of antibiotics.

 Interested persons may, on or before April 6, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments on the proposed guideline. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The
proposed guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Medicare Program; Special Payment Limits for Home Blood Glucose Monitors 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice would establish special payment limits for standard home blood glucose monitors, identified as code
E0607 of the HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). This proposed notice is intended to prevent excessive payment
for these items. Currently, payment under the Medicare program for home blood glucose monitors and other items of
durable medical equipment (DME) is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the item or the fee schedule
amount for the item. This notice proposes that payment for standard home blood glucose monitors be equal to 80 percent
of the lesser of the actual charge or a special payment limit.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


A. Special Reasonable Charge Limits 


Payment for DME furnished under Part B of the Medicare program (Supplementary Medical Insurance) is made through
contractors known as carriers. Before January 1, 1989, payment for DME was made on a reasonable charge basis. The methodology
used by the carriers to establish reasonable charges is set forth in sections 1833 and 1842(b) of the Social Security
Act (the Act) and in 42 CFR part 405, subpart E. Reasonable charge determinations are generally based on customary
and prevailing charges derived from historic charge data. The reasonable charge for an item of DME was generally set
at the lowest of the following factors: 
 The supplier's actual charge for the item. 
 The supplier's customary charge. 
 The prevailing charge in the locality for the item. (The prevailing charge may not exceed the 75th percentile
of the customary charges of suppliers in the locality.) 
 The inflation indexed charge (IIC). The IIC is defined in  405.509(a) as the lowest of the fee screens
used to determine reasonable charges for services, supplies, and equipment paid on a reasonable charge basis (excluding
physicians' services) that is in effect on December 31 of the previous fee screen year, updated by the inflation adjustment
factor. 
Section 1842(b)(3) of the Act requires that all payments under Part B of the Medicare program must be reasonable. Paragraphs
(8) and (9) of section 1842(b) of the Act provide that we may establish a special reasonable charge limit for a category
of service if, after consultation with representatives of affected parties, we determine that the standard rules
for calculating reasonable charges result in grossly deficient or excessive charges. 
Applicable regulations are located at  405.502(g). Section 405.502(g) requires that we consider the available
information that is relevant to the category of service and establish reasonable charge limits that are realistic
and equitable. The limit on the reasonable charge is an upper limit to correct a grossly excessive charge or a lower
limit to correct a grossly deficient charge. The limit is either a specific dollar amount or is based on a special method
to be used in determining the reasonable charge. 
Section 405.502(g)(1) provides the following examples of circumstances that may result in grossly deficient or
excessive charges: 

 The marketplace is not competitive.

 Medicare and Medicaid are the sole or primary source of payment for a service. 
 The charges involve the use of new technology for which an extensive charge history does not exist. 
 The charges do not reflect changing technology, increased facility with that technology, or changes in acquisition,
production, or supplier costs. 
 The prevailing charges for a service in a particular locality are substantially higher or lower than prevailing
charges in other comparable localities, taking into account the relative costs of furnishing the services in the
different localities. 
 Charges are grossly lower than or exceed acquisition or production costs. 
 There have been increases in charges for a service that cannot be explained by inflation or technology. 
 The prevailing charges for a service are substantially higher or lower than the payments made for the service
by other purchasers in the same locality. 
Section 405.502(g)(3) specifies that we announce payment limits in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, we publish in the 

Federal Register

 our intention to propose limits and allow 60 days for receipt of public comments on the proposal. After we have considered
all timely comments, we publish in the 

Federal Register

 a final notice announcing the special payment limits and our analyses and responses to the comments. Section 405.502(g)(3)
also provides that the proposed and final notices must set forth the criteria and circumstances, if any, under which
a carrier may grant an exception to the limit(s). 


B. DME Fee Schedules 


Section 4062 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87) (Public Law 100-203), which added section
1834(a) to the Act, provides for a fee schedule payment methodology for DME furnished on or after January 1, 1989. (This
fee schedule payment methodology is set forth in 42 CFR part 414, subpart D.) Sections 1834(a)(1) (A) and (B) of the
Act provide that Medicare payment for DME is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the item or the
fee schedule amount for the item. Section 1834(a) of the Act classifies DME into the following payment categories:

 Inexpensive or other routinely purchased DME. 
 Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing. 
 Customized items. 
 Oxygen and oxygen equipment. 
 Other items of DME (capped rental items).

 

There is a separate methodology for determining the fee schedule payment amount for each category of DME. The fee schedules
are adjusted annually by a covered item update factor. The covered item update factor is generally equal to the change
in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the preceding
year. 


Section 1834(a)(10)(B) provides that we may apply the special payment limits authority of paragraphs (8) and (9)
of section 1842(b) to covered items of DME and suppliers of these items and payments under section 1834(a) in the same
manner as these provisions apply to physician's services and physicians and reasonable charges under section 1842(b).



C. Payment for Home Blood Glucose Monitors (Code E0607) 


Standard home blood glucose monitors allow individuals to measure their blood glucose and, then, alter their diets
or insulin dosages to ensure that they are maintaining an adequate blood glucose level. Home blood glucose monitors
are covered by the Medicare program as DME and are classified under the inexpensive and other routinely purchased
DME payment category defined in section 1834(a)(2) of the Act. Section 1834(a)(2) specifies that inexpensive and
other routinely purchased DME are those items of DME that have a purchase price that does not exceed $150 or are acquired
at least 75 percent of the time by purchase. We determined that home blood glucose monitors belong in this category
based on a review of data that show that these monitors are acquired at least 75 percent of the time by purchase. 
Section 1834(a)(2) requires that payment for items falling within this category be made on a purchase or rental basis
and that local purchase and rental fee schedule amounts be calculated for each item. Section 414.220(c)(1) provides
for the calculation of purchase fee schedules for both new and used DME within this category. The fee schedule amounts
for purchased new, purchased used, and rental DME within this category are based on the average reasonable charges
for purchased new, purchased used, and rental DME, respectively, from the base year period of July 1, 1986 through
June 30, 1987.

The current 1993 fee schedule amounts for code E0607 accurately reflect the average reasonable charges for home blood
glucose monitors in 1986, adjusted by 1.7 percent (the percentage increase in the CPI-U for the 6-month period
ending with December 1987) and by the cumulative covered item update factor. The average 1993 fee schedule amount
for purchased new home blood glucose monitors, excluding the fee schedule amounts for the Virgin Islands, Alaska,
Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, is $178.73. However, as we explain below, due to manufacturers' widespread practice of issuing
consumer rebates, the fee schedule amounts substantially exceed the effective purchase amount (the list purchase
amount less any rebate) paid by the general public in all localities. 

We have reviewed pricing and rebate information available for the years 1986 through 1993 to become familiar with
the home blood glucose monitor market. Our pricing and rebate sources include: mail order catalogs (such as Bruce
Medical Supply catalog, St. Louis Medical Supply, and Institutional Products), advertisements listed in newspapers
and periodicals (such as Drug Topics and Shopper's Guide), and pharmacy and other retail store fliers. For the purposes
of this analysis, we focused on home blood glucose monitor pricing and national rebate programs listed in the Winter
1993 edition of the Bruce Medical Supply catalog (Vol. 15, No. 1), but the pricing and rebate information found in the
Bruce catalog is consistent with the pricing and rebate information available in all the other sources we examined.


In addition, in our experience, the Bruce catalog listed the largest number of home blood glucose monitors made by
the largest number of home blood glucose monitor manufacturers, and reflected the national rebate programs offered
by these manufacturers. Six different brands of home blood glucose monitors, manufactured by five different organizations,
can be purchased from the Bruce catalog from any location in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin
Islands and are covered under Medicare. The monitors listed are: Accu-Chek III, manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim;
Checkmate, manufactured by Cascade Medical; ExacTech Companion and ExacTech Pen, manufactured by MediSence; Glucometer
3, manufactured by Miles, Inc.; One Touch II, manufactured by Lifescan; and Tracer II, manufactured by Boehringer
Mannheim. We estimate that the six monitors listed in the Bruce catalog account for approximately 90 percent of the
market. This estimate is based on marketing information presented in an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal
on November 12, 1992 (Marketing and Media section, B1). 

We are using the Bruce catalog pricing and rebate information because it is a convenient single reference. We believe
the catalog is indicative of market pricing for home blood glucose monitors. In addition, the catalog lists the national
rebate programs offered by the manufacturers of the monitors. By choosing the Bruce catalog as the source of data for
proposing payment limits, we are not recommending that future purchases of home blood glucose monitors by Medicare
beneficiaries be made through the Bruce catalog. We are confident that comparable net prices are available in all
localities from the various other mail order or retail outlets. 

During the fee schedule base year period (July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987), retail prices for home blood glucose
monitors generally exceeded $150. Since then, several lower priced models have appeared on the market while the older,
higher priced models have been phased out. The growth in the home blood glucose monitor market and advances in the technology
of producing these monitors have caused the market value of the home blood glucose monitor to decline steadily, so
that now this item is readily available at prices below $70. In addition, manufacturers have begun the widespread
practice of issuing consumer rebates to promote their products. Mail-in manufacturers' rebates ranging from $20
to $75 have been available over the past several years. The Medicare program does not receive the benefit of many of
these rebates because, although suppliers bill for the price of the equipment, the rebates are sent to the beneficiary.


The average list price of the six monitors in the Bruce catalog is $65.44. Manufacturer rebates, ranging from $30 to
$50, are available for four of these monitors. A fifth monitor, the Checkmate, is listed at a price of $61.90, but can
be obtained through the catalog free of charge with the purchase of two boxes of Checkmate test strips, supplies that
are essential for the effective use of the Checkmate monitoring system. New home blood glucose monitors are now available
to the general public at a net cost that is well below the fee schedule amounts established for code E0607. 

Our findings are supported by the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) report ``Durable Medical Equipment_Review
of Medicare Payments for Home Blood Glucose Monitors'' (A-09-92-00034)_issued in December of
1992. In this report, the OIG states that excessive Medicare payments have been made for home blood glucose monitors
because claims were not adjusted to reflect manufacturers' rebates. The OIG reviewed a sample of 80 Medicare claims
for monitors processed by 2 carriers. From this sample, the OIG identified 50 claims for which rebates were available
at the time the monitors were purchased. The OIG found that Medicare payment for only 5 of these 50 claims were reduced
by the amount of the rebate. The OIG concluded that the fee schedule amounts established for code E0607 based on pre-1987
historic charges are excessive.

D. Supplier Consultation 


Sections 1834(a)(10)(B) and 1842(b)(9)(A)(i) of the Act require that we consult with representatives of the suppliers
likely to be affected by any change in payment before making a determination that a fee schedule amount(s) is not inherently
reasonable by reason of its grossly excessive or deficient amount. On June 15, 1993, we met with representatives of
suppliers of home blood glucose monitors (hereinafter referred to as supplier representatives) to discuss issues
relating to Medicare payment for these devices. The following is a synopsis of the comments and concerns of the supplier
representatives as expressed at this meeting. 
The supplier representatives were primarily concerned about the use of manufacturer rebate information in determining
appropriate Medicare payment amounts for home blood glucose monitors. They maintained that the rebate programs
are purely a marketing tool used by the manufacturers to promote the sale of their monitors, that the rebates do not
relate in any way to the ``market price'' of the monitors, and that the rebate programs are not permanent and, therefore,
should not be used as a basis for establishing payment amounts. 
Currently, if a manufacturer's rebate is included in the charge listed on a claim submitted for reimbursement to Medicare,
that rebate is to be clearly and specifically identified and is to be annotated as not reimbursable under Medicare.
Payment is based on the lower of the actual charge for the equipment (the submitted charge less the rebate amount) or
the fee schedule amount. However, as noted in the OIG report discussed above, in a majority of cases, the rebates are
not reported on the claims submitted to Medicare, resulting in Medicare overpayments. 
The Medicare payment amounts for home blood glucose monitors should not exceed the amounts paid by the general public
for these devices. The price of a home blood glucose monitor less any available rebate amount represents the actual
cost to the consumer for the device and is an appropriate basis for establishing Medicare payment amounts for these
devices. 
In the case of home blood glucose monitors, manufacturer rebates are widespread and have been available for several
years. The OIG reported that manufacturer rebates for home blood glucose monitors generally range from about $30
to $75 and that the duration of the rebate offer is continually extended, often lasting for more than 1 year or until
a new model is introduced. Given the facts underlying the pricing of these monitors, the retail prices of home blood
glucose monitors less the available rebate amounts are reasonable measures of the market value of these devices.

The supplier representatives maintained that some rebate programs are not available in some areas of the United States.
However, the rebates listed in the Bruce Medical Supply catalog are available to all Medicare beneficiaries living
in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. 
The supplier representatives stated that we should consider establishing inherent reasonableness limits for blood
glucose test strips, identified as code A4253 of the HCPCS. Medicare payment for these supplies is made on a reasonable
charge basis. The Medicare carriers, therefore, have the authority to establish inherent reasonableness limits
for code A4253. We are aware of several carriers that have established inherent reasonableness limits for this code.



II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice 


Based on our own experience and the work of OIG, and after consulting with representatives of suppliers of home blood
glucose monitors, we have determined that the fee schedule amounts for code E0607 are grossly excessive and are not
inherently reasonable. In accordance with section 1842(b)(8) of the Act, we are proposing to replace the use of a fee
schedule payment with special payment limits for code E0607. These special payment limits would not apply to home
blood glucose monitors with special features (HCPCS code E0609). 


A. Special Payment Limits for Code E0607 


1. New Home Blood Glucose Monitors

For purchased new home blood glucose monitors furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, we propose the following special
payment limits: 




Initial Year Special Payment Limits


Continental U.S
$57
Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
$65




These proposed limits are based on pricing and manufacturers' rebates contained in the Winter 1993 edition of the
Bruce Medical Supply catalog. We based the proposed limits for the continental U.S. on the median net cost, rounded
to the nearest dollar, of five of the six monitors listed in the catalog. We omitted the Checkmate monitor because this
monitor is relatively new to the market and has little market history. We determined the cost for each monitor to be
equal to the Bruce Medical Supply list price decreased by the manufacturer's mail-in rebate (if applicable) and increased
by appropriate shipping and handling charges effective December 1992. After making the adjustments for rebates
and shipping and handling charges, we are proposing a limit of $57 which exceeds the final cost for four of the six monitors
listed in the catalog. We permitted an additional shipping charge of $8 for monitors that are purchased in Alaska,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, our review of current pricing and rebate information
shows that several brands of new home blood glucose monitors can be widely purchased at prices below the proposed limits.

The information we used to calculate the proposed limits is presented below. 




The final median cost of the monitors listed in the Bruce catalog, excluding the Checkmate monitor, including shipping
and handling, and rounded to the nearest dollar is $57. We propose that this amount be established as the special payment
limit for new home blood glucose monitors furnished within the continental United States. The final median cost for
these monitors, if furnished in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands, including shipping
and handling, and rounded to the nearest dollar is $65. We propose that this amount be established as the special payment
limit for new home blood glucose monitors furnished outside the continental United States. 
We recognize that shipping and handling costs are unique to mail-order outlets and are not generally experienced
by retail outlets; however, we have chosen to include these shipping and handling costs, without regard to the type
of supplier, as a proxy for similar costs such as transportation and overhead that might be incurred by retail stores.
The average shipping and handling cost per monitor in the continental U.S. is approximately $7, an amount that we believe
sufficiently reflects expenses incurred by retail stores that supply home blood glucose monitors. The additional
shipping allowance of $8 is intended to reflect additional costs of shipping outside the continental U.S. 


2. Purchased Used Home Blood Glucose Monitors 


Historically, Medicare allowed payment amounts for the purchase of used DME have been set at approximately 75 percent
of the corresponding allowed payment amounts for the purchase of new DME. Based on this ongoing policy, for purchased
used home blood glucose monitors, the special payment limits would be equal to 75 percent of the special payment limits
for purchased new monitors. If the special payment limit for a purchased new home blood glucose monitor is $57, the
special payment limit for the purchased used monitor would be $42.75.

<PARENT> FR940106-2-00033 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Rented Home Blood Glucose Monitors 


Historically, Medicare-allowed payment amounts for the rental of DME have been set at approximately 10 percent of
the corresponding allowed payment amounts for the purchase of new DME. Based on this ongoing policy, for rented home
blood glucose monitors, the special payment limits would be equal to 10 percent of the special payment limits for purchased
new monitors. If the special payment limit for a purchased new home blood glucose monitor is $57, the special payment
limit for a rented monitor would be $5.70 each month. The total payment for a rented monitor would not be allowed to exceed
the lower of the actual charge or the fee for the purchase of the monitor. 


B. Applicability 


The initial special payment limits we propose would apply to standard home blood glucose monitors furnished on or
after the effective date of the published final notice and before January 1, 1994. For standard home blood glucose
monitors furnished in calendar year 1994, the special payment limits would be equal to the initial special payment
limits increased by the 1994 covered item update factor (the factor used to update other items of DME). The covered
item update for 1994, and each subsequent year, is defined in section 1834(a)(14)(B) of the Act as the percentage increase
in the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending with June of the previous year. For each calendar year after 1994,
the special payment limits would be equal to the special payment limits for the preceding calendar year increased
by the covered item update for the calendar year to which the limits would apply. 


C. Payment for Home Blood Glucose Monitors 


We propose that payment for home blood glucose monitors be equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for
the monitor or the appropriate special payment limit, as described in section A above. 



III. Regulatory Impact Statement 



A. Executive Order 12291 



Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any notice
that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_


 An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;

 A major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government
agencies, or geographic regions; or 

 Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the
ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

This proposed notice would reduce unnecessary Medicare program expenditures for standard home blood glucose monitors.
Currently, payment under the Medicare program for home glucose monitors is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the
actual charge for the item or the fee schedule amount for the item. Under this proposed notice, payment would be equal
to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge or the appropriate special payment limit proposed by this notice. 

We are proposing special payment limits for purchased new home blood glucose monitors for Medicare beneficiaries
of $57 if the monitor is furnished within the continental United States and $65 if furnished in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, or the Virgin Islands. 

We estimate that imposing special payment limits for purchased new home blood glucose monitors would produce savings
of $5 million annually, or $25 million from FY 1994 through FY 1998. 

This notice would not meet the $100 million criterion nor would it meet the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this
notice is not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all suppliers and manufacturers of home blood glucose
monitors are considered to be small entities. 

In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

In determining whether to adjust payment rates for standard home blood glucose monitors, we considered the potential
impacts on quality, access, and beneficiary liability of the adjustment, including the likely effects on assignment
rates and participation rates of suppliers (as required by section 1842(b)(8)(C) of the Act). These considerations
are addressed below in this impact analysis. 

This notice would affect suppliers of standard home blood glucose monitors. Their Medicare payments could be reduced
by the amount of the estimated savings. Suppliers can choose to accept assignment, which means they agree to accept
Medicare's approved amount as payment in full. It is possible that, as a consequence of our reducing payments for code
E0607, the number of suppliers accepting assignment of a beneficiary's claim for Medicare payment for this code may
decrease if suppliers choose instead to charge beneficiaries the full difference between the amount charged and
the lower Medicare payment. Also, the number of suppliers who elect to become ``participating suppliers'' may decrease
as a result of reduced payments for code E0607. Under the Medicare participation program, a supplier that decides
to become a ``participating supplier'' must agree to accept assignment for all covered services furnished to Medicare
beneficiaries. Participating suppliers benefit by being listed in the Medicare Participating Physician/Supplier
Directories, known as Medpards, which are compiled by the Medicare carriers and furnished to various senior citizen
groups. A Medicare beneficiary can obtain the Medpard for his or her State from the Medicare carrier. 

Suppliers who do not accept assignment and charge more than the Medicare approved amount can collect the balance,
that is, the actual charge minus Medicare payment, from the beneficiary. Therefore, beneficiaries who receive services
from suppliers who do not accept assignment are exposed to greater financial liability than those who receive services
from a supplier taking assignment. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to deal with participating suppliers
or purchase less expensive home blood glucose monitors in order to reduce their financial liability. 

Manufacturers of more expensive home blood glucose monitors may be affected if, as a result of this notice, suppliers
choose to provide less expensive monitors or Medicare beneficiaries decide to use less expensive monitors. We expect
that this notice would have minimal affects on the quality of monitors furnished to beneficiaries or on beneficiary
access to quality monitors. As we demonstrated above, four out of six home blood glucose monitors listed in the Bruce
Medical Supply catalog can be purchased from anywhere in the continental United States for less than $57. 

Though the estimated decrease in the allowed limit from $178.73 to $57 for monitors purchased in the continental U.S.
appears large, the net decrease is not large, given the size and prevalence of the rebates manufacturers have been
refunding to beneficiaries. Four of five manufacturers are giving rebates ranging from 37 percent to 70 percent of
the purchase price. In addition, the glucose test strips used with the monitors are specifically manufactured to
be used with a specific brand of monitor. The test strips frequently cost more than $.50 each and a beneficiary may use
4 or more each day. Therefore, once the beneficiary obtains a home blood glucose monitor, Medicare could pay an additional
$60 each month the beneficiary uses the medically necessary monitor. Apparently, the income generated from the ongoing
sale of the test strips far exceeds the income generated from the sale of the monitors. A manufacturer has an enormous
incentive to promote the sale of its brand of monitors in order to ensure the future sale of its brand of test strips.
For these reasons, we believe that manufacturers and suppliers will continue to provide their services to Medicare
beneficiaries. 

If a manufacturer's rebate is not reported on a Medicare claim for code E0607, and the beneficiary subsequently mails
in the rebate form, and receives the rebate, then the beneficiary receives a windfall in the amount of the rebate and
the Medicare program is not benefiting from the rebate. The beneficiary is essentially paid for purchasing a certain
brand of monitor. 
This notice would effectively eliminate any windfall that beneficiaries receive from manufacturer rebates that
are not reported on Medicare claims for code E0607. 

We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary
certifies, that this notice would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 


IV. Paperwork Reduction Act 



This notice does not impose any information collection requirements. Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the
Executive Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paper Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 through
3511). 


V. Response to Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment,
we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the ``DATES'' section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will
respond to the comments in the preamble to that document.

 Final notice with comment period. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 13564(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, this final notice with comment
period provides that the payment add-on for the administrative and general costs of hospital-based home health agencies
(HHAs) is eliminated. This notice also explains the effects of this provision on the methodology used in calculating
the HHA cost limits. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 



Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary to establish limits on allowable
costs incurred by a provider of services that may be paid under the Medicare program. These limits are based on estimates
of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services. Under this authority, we have maintained
limits on HHA per-visit costs since 1979. The limits may be applied to direct or indirect overall costs or to the costs
incurred for specific items or services furnished by the provider. This statutory provision is implemented in the
regulations at 
42 CFR 413.30. Additional statutory provisions governing the limits are contained at section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the
Act. Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(i) specifies that for cost reporting periods beginning after July 1, 1987, the cost limits
are not to exceed 112 percent of the mean of the labor-related and nonlabor per-visit costs for freestanding HHAs.
In addition, section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii) of the Act has required that an adjustment be made to the cost limits for the
administrative and general (A&G) costs of hospital-based agencies. The A&G per-visit add-on for hospital-based
HHAs has been applied since 1980. 

We published a notice with comment period that appeared in the July 8, 1993 issue of the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 36748) that set forth a revised schedule of limits on HHA costs for cost reporting periods beginning on or after
July 1, 1993. The limits were computed using actual cost per-visit data from cost reporting periods ending on or after
June 30, 1989 and before May 31, 1991, and were adjusted by the latest estimates in the ``market basket'' index to reflect
changes in the price of goods and services furnished by HHAs.

II. Provisions of This Final Notice With Comment Period 



A. Elimination of the A&G Add-on 



On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), Public Law 103-66, was enacted.
Section 13564(b) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii) of the Act to require that, effective for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1993, we no longer include a payment adjustment for the administrative and general costs of hospital-based
HHAs in computing the HHA limits. Under this provision, hospital-based HHAs and freestanding HHAs will be treated
identically for payment purposes. Thus, in computing a hospital-based HHA's cost limits for cost reporting periods
beginning on or after October 1, 1993, the A&G add-on amounts that were to apply, as set forth in Table II of the July
8, 1993 notice (58 FR 36753), will not be used. Other components of the July 8, 1993 notice, specifically the per-visit
limits in Table I, the wage indexes in Tables IIIa and IIIb, and the cost reporting year adjustment factors in Table
IV, will continue to be used to compute the limits. 

We note that section 13564(a) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act to provide that there be no
changes in the per-visit cost limits for home health services for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July
1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996. Since the effective date of that provision is different from that of the elimination
of the A&G add-on, we intend to publish a separate notice in a future 

Federal Register

 to explain the effects of the delay in the update. Again, the only change in the methodology for computing the HHA cost
limits that is effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 is the elimination of the
A&G add-on for hospital-based HHAs. 



B. Computing the Cost Limit for a Hospital-Based HHA 



The example below illustrates how an adjusted occupational therapy per-visit cost limit is calculated for a hospital-based
HHA in Dallas, Texas, with a 12-month cost reporting period beginning October 1, 1993. Because the A&G add-on
has been eliminated, this example is identical to the example contained in our July 8, 1993 notice (58 FR 36752) of the
calculation of a limit for a free-standing HHA, with the exception of the application of a different cost reporting
period adjustment factor, as set forth in Table IV of that notice. These factors are based on the month and year in which
an HHA's cost reporting period begins, and are used to account for inflation in costs that occurs after the effective
date of the latest schedule of HHA limits. Thus, in the example below, the adjustment factor from Table IV of the July
8, 1993 notice for an HHA with a cost reporting period beginning October 1, 1993 is applied. 

To arrive at the adjusted limit, the HHA's intermediary first determines the adjusted labor-related component by
multiplying the labor-related component of the limit by the appropriate wage index value, and then adjusts for budget
neutrality. The adjusted limit is the sum of the adjusted labor-related component, plus the nonlabor component,
plus other adjustments (if applicable), multiplied by the applicable cost reporting period adjustment factor.




Example: 

Calculation of an Adjusted Occupational Therapy 
Limit for a Hospital-Based HHA in Dallas, Texas for a Cost 
Reporting Period Beginning October 1, 1993 (using the 
appropriate tables from the July 8, 1993 schedule of limits) 









If an HHA uses a cost reporting period that is not 12 months in duration, a special adjustment factor is calculated.
This is necessary because inflation projections are computed to the midpoint of the cost reporting period, and the
adjustment factors in Table IV are based on 12-month cost reporting periods. For cost reporting periods other than
12 months, the calculation must be made for the midpoint of the specific cost reporting period. In these cases, the
intermediary for the HHA obtains this adjustment factor from HCFA. 

In the July 8, 1993 notice, we also set forth an example of a cost-limit calculation with A&G add-on for a hospital-based
HHA in State College, Pennsylvania (58 FR 36754). That example, as well as any other references in that document to
the A&G add-on, are no longer applicable for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. 



III. Impact Statement 



Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria
for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_ 

  Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or adversely affect, in a material way, the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; 

 Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

 Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or 

 Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in E.O. 12866.

In addition, for final notices such as this, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that this notice
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all
HHAs are treated as small entities. 

This final notice with comment period announces the provisions of section 13564(b) of OBRA '93, which provides for
the elimination of the A&G add-on for hospital-based HHAs, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 1993. None of the provisions of this notice interprets or extends requirements beyond those set
forth in OBRA '93. 

Section 13564(b) of OBRA '93 will result in significant Federal cost savings. The impact of this provision is discussed
further below. This notice explains how the provision affects the methodology for calculating the HHA limits. We
do not believe that merely explaining the results of this provision in this notice produces any effect that will meet
any of the criteria of E.O. 12866 for a significant regulatory action or will have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities. Therefore, we have determined and the Secretary certifies that neither an impact statement
under E.O. 12866 nor a regulatory flexibility analysis under the RFA are required. 

To the extent that a legislative provision being announced by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on
beneficiaries or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns.
In this instance, we believe it is desirable to inform the public of our estimate of the substantial budgetary effect
of this statutory change. We estimate that the elimination of the add-on for hospital-based HHAs will result in the
following savings to the Medicare program: 







We have attempted to examine the overall effects of this provision on hospital-based HHAs. As illustrated in Table
2 below, we estimate that the elimination of the A&G add-on for hospital-based HHAs will result in substantial
increases in the number of hospital-based HHAs that meet or exceed the cost limits.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00063 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00034 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 






The model used for our analysis is based on data from 1,599 hospital-based HHAs. In our July 8, 1993 notice, which used
the same model, we estimated that 774 hospital-based HHA in the model would meet or exceed the HHA cost limits. Thus,
we believe that the proportion of hospital-based HHAs that will meet or exceed the cost limits is likely to increase
from approximately 48 percent (774/1599) to 72 percent (1144/1599) as a result of the elimination of the A&G add-on.



We are unable to identify the effects of this provision on individual hospital-based home health agencies. However,
we anticipate that overall FY 1994 Medicare payments for hospital-based HHAs will be approximately 6 percent less
than they would have been if the A&G add-on had not been eliminated. The effects of this reduction on the total revenues
of individual hospital-based HHAs will depend on the HHA's ability to operate within the cost limits and on the proportion
of the HHA's revenues that come from the Medicare program. 



Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice such as
this may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.



We have not prepared a rural impact statement since we have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final
notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.




IV. Other Required Information 




A. Waiver of Proposed Notice and 30-Day Delay in the Effective Date 





In adopting notices such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the Federal Register

 with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. We also normally provide a
delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive these procedures if we find good
cause that prior notice and comment or a delay in the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to
the public interest. 



Section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1))(L)(ii) of the Act to eliminate, effective for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, the adjustment to the HHA cost limits to recognize the administrative
and general costs of hospital-based HHAs. In conformance with the clear direction of section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA
'93, this notice announces the elimination of the adjustment to the HHA cost limits to recognize the administrative
and general costs of hospital-based HHAs and explains the effect that this action will have on methodology for calculating
the cost limits of hospital-based HHAs. We have made no changes in this methodology beyond those directly required
by section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93, nor are there any other discretionary aspects to this notice. Moreover, section
13564(b)(2) of OBRA '93 mandates that these provisions are effective beginning with cost reporting periods beginning
on or after 
October 1, 1993. Thus, we have concluded that in this instance, it would be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary
to the public interest to publish a proposed notice or to provide for a 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice.
Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed notice and the 30-day delay in effective date. However,
we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this notice.




B. Paperwork Reduction Act 





This final notice does not impose information collection requirements. Consequently, it does not need to be reviewed
by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).





C. Public Comments 





Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a notice with comment period, we are not
able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments concerning the provisions
of this notice that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``

DATES

'' section of this notice, and, if changes are made in another notice, we will respond to these comments in that notice.

Final notice with comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final notice with comment period provides that there will be no changes in the skilled nursing facility (SNF)
cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning during Federal fiscal years 1994 and 1995 and that the add-on for
administrative and general costs of hospital-based SNFs is eliminated. This notice announces provisions of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that affect the schedule of limits on SNF routine service costs for which
payment may be made under the Medicare program and explains the effects of these provisions on the methodology used
in calculating the SNF cost limits.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background 





Sections 1861(v)(1)(A) and 1888 of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorize the Secretary to set limits on allowable
costs incurred by a provider of services for which payment may be made under Medicare. These limits are based on estimates
of the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of needed health services. Implementing regulations appear at
42 CFR 413.30. Section 1888 of the Act directs the Secretary to set limits on per diem inpatient routine service costs
for hospital-based and freestanding skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) by urban or rural area location. Section
4008(e)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508) amended section 1888(a) of the
Act to require the Secretary to update the per diem SNF cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after
October 1, 1992, and every 2 years thereafter. 



Under the authority of section 1888 of the Act, we published a final notice on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46177) announcing
a schedule of limits for freestanding and hospital-based SNFs effective for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 1992. The limits were computed using data from cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30,
1989, through May 31, 1990, for freestanding SNFs and from cost reporting periods ending on or after October 31, 1988,
through September 30, 1989, for hospital-based SNFs.

The October 7, 1992 final notice contained provisions relating to: 
(1) Separate group limits for labor-related and nonlabor-related components of SNF per diem routine service costs;

(2) Adjustments to the cost limits by an area wage index developed from hospital industry wages; 
(3) A ``market basket'' index developed to reflect changes in the price of goods and services purchased by SNFs; 
(4) Application of the adjusted hospital wage index to wages, employee benefits, health service costs, costs of business
services, and other miscellaneous expenses; 
(5) Freestanding SNF cost limits set at 112 percent of the average per diem labor-related and nonlabor-related costs;

(6) Hospital-based SNF cost limits set at the limit for freestanding SNFs, plus 50 percent of the difference between
the freestanding limit and 112 percent of the average per diem routine service costs of hospital-based SNFs, and an
add-on for administrative and general (A&G) costs; 
(7) Cost-of-living adjustments for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; 
(8) Exceptions to the cost limits; 
(9) A classification system based on whether the SNF is hospital-based or freestanding and whether it is located in
an urban or rural area. 
In addition to the above provisions, the October 7, 1992 final notice also provided for a per diem add-on to recognize
the costs incurred by SNFs in complying with the additional nursing home reform requirements of section 1819 of the
Act (including the costs of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluations). (Section 1861(v)(1)(E)
of the Act provides for Medicare payment for costs incurred by SNFs in complying with the requirements of section 1819
of the Act.) The October 7, 1992 notice also included an add-on to the cost limits to recognize the costs that SNFs may
incur in meeting the universal precaution requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
These requirements were described in a final rule published by OSHA in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1991 (54 FR 64004) that set forth a standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655) to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. 


II. Provisions of This Final Notice With Comment Period 


A. No Changes in the Cost Limits 


On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), Public Law 103-66, was enacted.
Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 requires that there be no changes in the SNF routine cost limits (except as may be necessary
to take into account the elimination of the administrative and general add-on for hospital-based SNFs) for cost reporting
periods beginning during Federal fiscal years (FY) 1994 and 1995, that is, for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1995. The effect of this provision is that a SNF's latest routine cost
limit for a period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and before October 1, 1993, as calculated under the October
7, 1992 notice, without regard to any subsequent adjustments under section 1888(c) of the Act such as exceptions,
will remain in effect until its cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1995. Accordingly, there will
be no changes to a SNF's cost limit for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October
1, 1995, to account for inflation, updates of the data, changes to the wage index or to MSA designations. Thus, in computing
a provider's cost limit for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 and before October 1, 1995,
the cost reporting period adjustment factors that were to apply for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October
1, 1993, as set forth in Table IV of the October 7, 1992 notice (57 FR 46188), will not be used. Other components of the
October 7, 1992 notice, specifically the SNF Group Limits in Table I, and the wage indexes in Tables II and III will continue
to be used to compute the limits, with the exception in Table I of the add-on for administrative and general costs of
hospital-based SNFs. 
In the example below, a freestanding SNF in Dallas, Texas has a cost reporting period beginning date of January 1, 1993.
As calculated under the October 7, 1992 notice, its cost limit for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1993 is
$96.97. Under the provisions of this notice, the cost limit of $96.97 will remain in effect for its 12-month cost reporting
periods beginning January 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995. As explained above, the cost reporting period adjustment factors
that would have been used under the October 7, 1992 notice for calculating the limits for the SNF's new cost reporting
periods beginning January 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995, are not used. Accordingly, the provider in this example will
not have any change in its cost limit until its cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1996.

<TEXT>
 

As noted above, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 but before October 1, 1995, a SNF's
cost limit will be its latest routine cost limit for the period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and before October
1, 1993, as calculated under the October 7, 1992 notice and without regard to any subsequent adjustments, such as an
exception to the limit. Thus, if the SNF in the above example received an exception to its cost limit for its cost reporting
period beginning January 1, 1993, its cost limit for the cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1994 would not
include the exception amount for the previous period. To receive an exception or other adjustment to its cost limit,
the SNF would need to submit a request to its fiscal intermediary in accordance with the procedures set forth in  413.30
of the regulations. 


B. Periods Other Than 12 Months 


The above methodology applies to providers with cost reporting periods of 12 months in duration. If a facility's cost
reporting period is not 12 months in duration, a special adjustment factor is calculated. This is necessary because
inflation projections are computed to the midpoint of a cost reporting period, and the adjustment factors in Table
IV are based on 12-month reporting periods. For cost reporting periods of other than 12 months, the calculation must
be made based on the midpoint of the specific cost reporting period. The SNF's intermediary obtains this adjustment
factor from HCFA central office. This methodology results in a different cost limit than if a 12-month adjustment
factor were used. However, since the provisions of OBRA '93 require no changes in the cost limit on or after October
1, 1993, the limit calculated with the special adjustment factor will remain in place for subsequent cost reporting
periods beginning before October 1, 1995. 


C. Providers Entering the Medicare Program 


For providers entering the Medicare program on or after October 1, 1993 and before October 1, 1995, the applicable
cost limit will be the cost limit for the identical period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 through September 30,
1993. For example, if a provider enters the Medicare program on September 1, 1994, with a 12-month cost reporting period,
its cost limit will be determined in the same manner as a cost limit for a period beginning September 1, 1993 and ending
August 30, 1994. If the provider's cost reporting period is a short period beginning September 1, 1994 and ending December
31, 1994, the provider's cost limit will be determined in the same manner as a cost limit for a period beginning September
1, 1993 and ending December 31, 1993. In addition, whether the first period is a full 12-month period or a period other
than 12 months, the cost limit determined for the first period will remain in effect until the provider's first cost
reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1995. 


D. Next Update of Limits 


As discussed above, before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(a) of the Act required that the SNF routine cost
limits be updated on October 1, 1992 and every 2 years thereafter. Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 amended this section
to delay the next update until October 1, 1995, and every 2 years thereafter. Accordingly, there will be no changes
to the routine cost limits published in the October 7, 1992 notice for inflation, changes in the wage index, geographic
designation, or for a more recent data base until October 1, 1995. 


E. Add-On for Hospital-Based SNFs 


Before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(b) of the Act provided for an add-on to recognize the cost differences
between hospital-based and freestanding SNFs attributable to excess overhead allocations, that is, an add-on for
the administrative and general costs (A&G) of hospital-based SNFs. Section 13503(a)(3) of OBRA '93 amended
this section of the Act to repeal the requirement that we recognize cost differences attributable to excess overhead
allocations. Therefore, this notice implements that provision by eliminating the A&G add-on for hospital-based
SNFs. In addition, while section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 requires that there be no changes in the cost limits, as explained
above, it also states that the provision does not apply to the elimination of the A&G add-on for hospital-based
SNFs. Therefore, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, we will no longer apply
the administrative and general add-on for hospital-based SNFs as shown in Table I of the October 7, 1992 schedule of
limits. The intermediary will continue to determine the cost limits for hospital-based SNFs using the relevant instructions
and Table I SNF Group Limits, as described in the October 7, 1992 notice. However, for cost reporting periods beginning
on or after October 1, 1993, these limits will be calculated without using the A&G add-on. 
The example below uses information from Table I of the October 7, 1992 schedule of limits to calculate a cost limit for
a hospital-based SNF located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The cost limit is for a cost reporting period beginning October
1, 1993. However, as discussed above, the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs is no longer applied, and the cost
limit effective October 1, 1992 remains in effect for the cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1993.

F. Adjustments to the Routine Limits 



Section 1888(c) of the Act provides for appropriate adjustments to the SNF routine cost limits. These adjustments
are set forth at  413.30 and include: exemptions from the cost limits for new providers; exceptions to the limits
for atypical services and extraordinary circumstances; and other provisions. Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 mandates
that the effect of allowing no changes in the SNF routine cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning during FYs
1994 and 1995 not be considered in making adjustments to the routine cost limits under the exceptions process. Therefore,
effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1995, a provider
may request an exception only for costs incurred above the amount that the limit would have been had the provisions
set forth in this notice regarding no changes in the cost limits not been enacted. Accordingly, for the purpose of determining
the amount of an exception to the SNF routine cost limits under the regulations at  413.30(f), the difference
between the amount of a provider's cost limit as determined by the provisions set forth in this notice, and the amount
that a provider's cost limit would have been under the October 7, 1992 notice had the provisions described herein not
been enacted, is not subject to an exception to the routine cost limits. We note that this provision does not apply to
the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs. That is, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993,
the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs will not be used in computing the amount that the hospital-based cost limit
would have been had the provisions requiring no changes in the limits not been enacted. In addition, we note that this
provision has no effect on new provider exemptions to the SNF cost limits, as set forth under  413.30(e)(2),
since this exemption removes the limitation on a SNF's routine costs. 


The example below demonstrates the computation to determine the amount not subject to an exception under the provisions
set forth in this notice. The provider's cost limit is computed for the cost reporting period beginning January 1,
1993, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this notice, and this limit remains in effect until the cost reporting
period beginning January 1, 1995. The provider has requested an exception to its limit for the period beginning January
1, 1994. Again, we use the information from the October 7, 1992 notice to calculate what the limit would have been had
the OBRA '93 provisions requiring no changes in the limits not been enacted. The difference of $5.04 between the actual
limit and the amount the limit would have been is the amount not subject to an exception.

III. Impact Statement 



Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria
for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_

 Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities;

 Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

 Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or 

 Raise a novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in E.O. 12866.

In addition for final notices such as this, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that this notice
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all
SNFs are treated as small entities. 

This final notice with comment period announces the provisions of section 13503(a) of OBRA '93, which provides for
a delay in the updates of the limits on payments for routine SNF services through cost reporting periods beginning
before October 1, 1995, and provides for the elimination of the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs effective
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. None of the provisions of this notice interprets
or extends requirements beyond those set forth in OBRA '93. 

Sections 13503(a)(1) and (3) of OBRA '93 will result in significant Federal cost savings. The impact of these provisions
is discussed further below. This notice explains the revised methodology for calculating the SNF limits that results
from the provisions of OBRA '93. We do not believe that merely reflecting these provisions in this notice produces
any effect that will meet any of the criteria of E.O. 12866 for a significant regulatory action or will have a significant
effect on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we have determined and the Secretary certifies that
neither an impact analysis under E.O. 12866 nor a regulatory flexibility analysis under the RFA are required. 

To the extent that a legislative provision being announced by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on
beneficiaries or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns.
In this instance, we believe it is desirable to inform the public of our estimate of the substantial budgetary effect
of these statutory changes. We estimate that these statutory provisions will result in the following savings to the
Medicare program:

As illustrated in Table 2 below, the delay in updating the cost limits until October 1, 1995, combined with the elimination
of the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs, will result in a small increase in the number of SNFs exceeding the SNF
limits in all categories, although we cannot isolate the separate impact of these factors. Table 2 below shows the
combined impact of these changes.

<PARENT> FR940106-2-00035 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We are unable to identify the effects of these provisions on individual SNFs. However, we anticipate that overall
SNF payments for FY 1994 and FY 1995 will be approximately 1.2 percent and 2.3 percent less, respectively, than they
would have been in those years if the OBRA '93 provisions were not in effect. Moreover, since Medicare does not account
for a high proportion of SNF utilization or revenue, we estimate that the delay in updating the limits and the elimination
of the hospital-based add-on will not result in a significant number of facilities' total revenues being increased
or reduced by 3 percent or more from the October 7, 1992 limits, adjusted for inflation. Thus, we have determined that
the economic impact on SNFs will not be significant. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice such as
this may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
We have not prepared a rural impact statement since we have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final
notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.



IV. Other Required Information 


A. Paperwork Reduction Act 


This final notice with comment period does not impose information collection requirements. Consequently, it need
not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3501 through 3511). 


B. Waiver of Proposed Notice and 30-Day Delay in the Effective Date 


In adopting notices such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the 

Federal Register

 with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. We also normally provide a
delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive these procedures if we find good
cause that prior notice and comment or a delay in the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to
the public interest. 
As discussed above, before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(a) of the Act required that the SNF routine cost
limits be updated for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and every 2 years thereafter. However,
section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 specifies that there be no changes in the SNF cost limits for cost reporting periods
beginning during FYs 1994 and 1995, and section 13503(a)(2) of OBRA '93 amended section 1888 of the Act to delay the
next required update of the SNF limits until October 1, 1995. In addition, section 13503(a)(3) of OBRA '93 amended
section 1888(b) of the Act to eliminate, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993,
the add-on to the SNF cost limits to recognize the higher administrative and general costs of hospital-based SNFs.

In conformance with the clear direction of section 13503(a) of OBRA '93, this notice announces the new SNF provisions
and explains the effects of these provisions on the methodology used in calculating the SNF cost limits. We have made
no changes in this methodology beyond those directly required by OBRA '93, nor are there any other discretionary aspects
to this notice. Moreover, section 13503(a) of OBRA '93 mandates that these provisions are effective beginning with
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. Thus, we have concluded that in this instance, it would
be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to publish a proposed notice or to provide for
a 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice. Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed
notice and the 30-day delay in effective date. However, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated
at the beginning of this preamble. 


C. Public Comments 


Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive, we are not able to acknowledge or respond
to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``Date''
section of the preamble to this notice. If we make any changes to this notice, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to the notice that incorporates the changes.

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement, Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''
for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference and Proposed Funding Priority for Grants for Establishment
of Departments of Family Medicine for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
announces that applications for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for 
Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine are being 
accepted under the authority of section 747(b), (previously section 780) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act,
title VII, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408,
dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentage for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant
Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference, and proposed funding priority
stated below. 

Approximately $9.4 million will be available for the Grants for Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine
program in FY 1994. Total continuation support recommended is $5.7 million. It is anticipated that $3.7 million will
be available to support approximately 22 competing awards averaging $170,000. 



Purpose 



Section 747(b) of the PHS Act authorizes support to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to meet the costs
of projects to establish, maintain, or improve family medicine academic administrative units (which may be departments,
divisions, or other units) to provide clinical instruction in family medicine. Funds awarded will be used to: (l)
Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in
family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b)
support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine. 

The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the
planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine
activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family
medicine training programs under section 747(a). 



Previous Funding Experience 



Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. 

In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 50 competing applications for the Grants for Departments of Family Medicine program. Of
those applications 82 percent were approved and 18 percent were disapproved. Twelve projects, or 24 percent of applications
received, were funded. 

In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 71 competing applications. Of those applications, 66 percent were approved and 34 percent
were disapproved. Thirty-six projects, or about 50 percent of the applications received, were funded. 



Eligibility 



To be eligible to receive support for this grant program, the applicant must be a public, or nonprofit private, accredited
school of medicine or osteopathic medicine. 

To receive support, programs must meet the requirements of final regulations as set forth in 42 CFR part 57, subpart
R, 
and section 791(b) of the PHS Act. 

The period of Federal support will not exceed 5 years. 



National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 



The Public Health Service urges applicants to submit work plans that address specific objectives of Healthy People
2000. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0)
or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent
of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone (202) 783-3238). 



Education and Service Linkage 



As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public
Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.




Review Criteria 



The review of applications will take into consideration the following criteria: 

1. The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for the project requirements in section 57.1704;


2. The administrative and management capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost 
effective manner; 

3. The qualifications of the proposed staff and faculty of 
the unit; and 

4. The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis. 



Other Considerations 



In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications: 

1. Funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of applications ahead of other categories
or groups of approved applications such as competing continuation projects ahead of new projects. 

2. Funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores when applications meet specified
criteria.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00072 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00036 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



General Statutory Funding Preference 



As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_

(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice 
settings having the principal focus of serving 
residents of medically underserved communities; or 

(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for 
which an award is sought, has achieved a significant 
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such 
settings. This preference will only be applied to 
applications that rank above the 20th percentile that 
have been recommended for approval by the peer review 
group. 



Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



``High rate'' means that 20 percent of all graduates of the medical school in 1989 or 1990, whichever is greater, are
spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in the specified settings.

``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of placing 1989 or 1990 graduates in the specified settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of graduates from the most recent year (1990) are working in these settings. 

Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 40659, dated July 29, 1993. 



Establishment and Expansion 



Public Law 102-408 has amended section 747(b), (previously section 780) to include the following statutory
funding preference for this program. 

Section 747(b)(2) provides that preference shall be given to any qualified applicant that agrees to expend the award
for one of the following purposes: 

(a) Establishing an academic administrative unit (defined as a department, division, or other unit), for programs
in family medicine; or 

(b) Substantially expanding the programs of such a unit. 

A program will meet the definition of ``substantial expansion'' if it has developed an acceptable plan for a 50 percent
increase in a sufficient number of the following areas to qualify for 70 points. The expansion must be completed within
3 years. 



 



More detail on each of these areas will be provided in the 
program application materials. 



Established Funding Priority for FY 1994 



The following funding priority was established in FY 1993, after public comment at 58 FR 35019, June 30, 1993, and is
being continued in FY 1994. 

A funding priority will be given to applicants that demonstrate either substantial progress over the last 3 years
or a significant experience of 10 or more years in influencing graduates from those minority or low-income populations
identified as at-risk of poor health outcomes to enter family medicine residency training.

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement and Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''
for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs
for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal
year (FY) 1994 Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs under the authority of section 831(a), title VIII
of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title
II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13,
1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the
rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference. 
Approximately $1,791,000 will be available in FY 1994 for this program. Total continuation support recommended
is $1,316,000. It is anticipated that approximately $475,000 will be available to support 5 competing awards averaging
$95,000. 


Previous Funding Experience 


Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 16 eligible applications for Grants
for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs. Of those applications, 88 percent were approved and 12 percent were disapproved.
Eight projects or 57 percent of the competing applications approved, were funded. In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 3 applications
for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs. Of those applications, 67 percent were approved and 33 percent
were disapproved. Two projects, or 67 percent of the applications received, were funded. 


Purpose 


Section 831(a) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to cover the costs of projects
to develop and operate programs for the education of nurse anesthetists. The period of Federal support may not exceed
3 years. 


Eligibility 


Eligible applicants for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs are public or private nonprofit institutions,
accredited by an entity or entities designated by the Secretary of Education. Grants may be awarded to develop and
operate a new nurse anesthetist program. Grants may also be awarded to maintain or expand an existing program. 


National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 


The Public Health Service urges applicants to submit work plans that address specific objectives of Healthy People
2000. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0)
or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent
of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402-9325 (Telephone 202-783-3238).



Education and Service Linkage 


As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public
Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.



Review Criteria 


The review of applications will take into consideration the following criteria: 
1. The national or special local need which the particular project proposes to serve with special emphasis on meeting
shortages in underserved areas; 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00037 </PARENT>

2. The potential effectiveness and impact of the proposed project including its potential contribution to nursing;

3. The administrative and managerial capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project; 
4. The appropriateness of the plan, including the timetable for carrying out the activities of the proposed project
and achieving and measuring the project's stated objectives; 
5. The capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project; 
6. The reasonableness of the budget for the proposed project, including the justification of the grant funds requested;
and 
7. The potential of the nurse anesthetist program to continue on a self-sustaining basis after the period of grant
support. 


Other Considerations 


In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 
A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications. 
A funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores of individual approved applications
when applications meet specified criteria. 
It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 


Statutory Funding Preference 


In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_(A) has a high
rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved
communities; or (B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved
a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. Preference will be given only for applications
ranked above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the appropriate peer
review group. 


Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 


``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990-91, 1991-92 or 1992-93
who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing
care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted.

``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. 
Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 40659, July 29, 1993.


Established Funding Priority 


The following funding priority was established in FY 1993 following public comment (58 FR 40657, July 29, 1993) and
the Administration is extending this funding priority in FY 1994. A funding priority will be given to programs which
demonstrate either substantial progress over the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling
and graduating students from those minority populations identified as at-risk of poor health outcomes.

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications are being accepted for fiscal
year (FY) 1994, Grants for Interdisciplinary Training for Health Care for Rural Areas under the authority of section
778, title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments
of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 

Approximately $4,017,000 will be available in FY 1994 for this program. Total continuation support recommended
is approximately $1,600,000. It is anticipated that $2,417,000 will be available to support 12 competing awards
averaging approximately $180,000. 

Funding for this program is designed to test innovative training approaches that may be replicated in similar settings.




Previous Funding Experience 



Previous funding experience is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding
submission of an application for this program. In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 29 applications for Grants for Interdisciplinary
Training for Health Care for Rural Areas. Of those applications, 45 percent were approved and 55 percent were disapproved.
Eight projects, or 28 percent of the applications received, were funded. There was no competitive cycle for FY 1992.




Purposes 



Section 778 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to award grants for interdisciplinary
training projects designed to provide or improve access to health care in rural areas. Specifically, projects funded
under this authority shall be designed to:

comprehensive health care; 

(c) Deliver health care services to individuals residing in rural areas; 
(d) Enhance the amount of relevant research conducted concerning health care issues in rural areas; and 

(e) Increase the recruitment and retention of health care practitioners in rural areas and make rural practice a more
attractive career choice for health care practitioners. 

A recipient of funds may use various methods in carrying out the projects described above. The legislation cites the
following methods as examples: 

(a) The distribution of stipends to students of eligible applicants; 

(b) The establishment of a postdoctoral fellowship program; 

(c) The training of faculty in the economic and logistical problems confronting rural health care delivery systems;
or 

(d) The purchase or rental of transportation and telecommunication equipment where the need for such equipment due
to unique characteristics of the rural area is demonstrated by the recipient.

in a State and be: 

1. A local health department, or

Applicants eligible to obtain funds under this grant program shall not include for-profit entities, either directly
or through a subcontract or subgrant. 

Each application must be jointly submitted by at least two eligible applicants. One of the applicants must be an academic
institution. Each application must demonstrate the need and demand for health care services, knowledge of available
resources and the most significant service and educational gaps within its targeted geographic area. One applicant
must be designated the principal organization responsible and accountable for the conduct of the proposed project.

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of four draft recovery
plans for the following species: The Key Largo woodrat (

Neotoma floridana smalli

) 
and cotton mouse (

Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola

), Gulf sturgeon (

Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi

) two Hernando County plants (

Campanula robinsiae, Justicia cooleyi

), and four Apalachicola plants (

Euphorbia telephioides, Macbridea alba, Pinguicula ionantha, Scutellaria floridana

). The Key Largo woodrat and Key Largo cotton mouse are restricted to the north half of Key Largo, Monroe County, Florida.
The Gulf sturgeon occurs in most major rivers from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River, and marine waters of
the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico and Florida Bay. The two Hernando County plants occur in the hilly countryside
north of Tampa. The four Apalachicola plants occur in the pinelands and wetlands in Liberty, Franklin, Gulf, and Bay
Counties in the Florida panhandle. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on these draft plans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
plans describe actions necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels
for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice, and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
The Key Largo woodrat and cotton mouse were listed as endangered species on August 31, 1984. Both species require tropical
hardwood hammock forests for food and cover. An estimated 6,500 woodrats and 18,000 cotton mice occur on 2,100 acres
of forested uplands. Both species originally occurred throughout all of the hardwood hammocks of Key Largo, but are
now restricted to only north Key Largo, representing about one-half their original distribution. Primary threats
to these species include habitat destruction and fragmentation, road mortality, and vulnerability to catastrophic
events such as storms or fires. Current habitat acquisition by both the State and Federal governments will provide
nearly complete public ownership for the remaining hardwood hammocks on north Key Largo. Specific recovery actions
include additional habitat purchase and protection and the future reestablishment of both species to the southern
portion of Key Largo.
The Gulf sturgeon, a subspecies of the Atlantic sturgeon 

Acipenser oxyrinchus

, was listed as a threatened species on September 30, 1991. The Gulf sturgeon is an anadromous fish which migrates from
salt water into large coastal rivers to spawn and spend the warmer months. The majority of its life is spent in fresh
water. The current population levels of Gulf sturgeon in rivers other than the Suwannee and Apalachicola rivers are
unknown, but are thought to be reduced from historic levels. Historically, the subspecies occurred in most major
rivers from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River, and marine waters of the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico
to Florida Bay. Major factors in the decline of the Gulf sturgeon include barriers (dams) to historical spawning habitats,
habitat loss, water quality degradation, and overfishing.
The recovery plan for the Gulf sturgeon was prepared by a Recovery Team containing members from the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, the National Marine Fisheries
Service, the National Biological Survey, university researchers, commercial fishing interests, conservation
organizations, and the Service. The draft plan currently available for public comment resulted from a technical
review during the summer of 1992. Major recovery actions include identifying and restoring essential habitats of
the Gulf sturgeon. Initial restoration efforts will focus on riverine habitats. Another recovery action includes
reducing incidental catch of the fish by commercial fishermen. The ultimate recovery goal for the Gulf sturgeon is
to establish population levels that would allow delisting of the fish in selected river systems. After delisting,
the goal is to establish populations that could support commercial fishing in those selected river systems.
The two Hernando County plants 

Campanula robinsiae 

(Brooksville bellflower) and 

Justicia cooleyi

 (Cooley's water-willow) were listed as endangered species on August 28, 1989. Brooksville bellflower inhabits
wet ``prairies'' and lake margins in the hill country of Hernando County. Cooley's water-willow primarily inhabits
hardwood forests, but appears to persist or thrive in clearings, pastures, and roadsides. Its distribution appears
to be primarily in the hills of Hernando County, but it is also known from Sumter County, near Mascotte. The draft recovery
plan emphasizes better information on the life history of the bellflower, an annual that grows in late winter and is
often under water. For Cooley's water-willow, immediate efforts are needed to control the spread of alien pest vines,
especially air-potato (a tropical yam that produces tubers on its vines) and skunkvine (an Asian vine that can cover
the ground in a forest, and whose leaves have a fecal odor when brused). Recovery efforts for these plants will begin
on land owned by Federal and State agencies.

Three Apalachicola plants were listed as threatened species on May 8, 1992: 

Euphorbia telephioides

 (Telephus spurge), 

Macbridea alba

 (white birds-in-a-nest), and 

Scutellaria floridana

 (Florida skullcap). The fourth species, 

Pinguicula ionantha

 (Godfrey's butterwort) was listed as a threatened species on July 12, 1993. These four plants overlap in their distributions
and habitats in the low-lying outer Coastal Plain near the Apalachicola River, roughly from the southwestern portion
of Apalachicola National Forest west to Panama City. Telephus spurge occupies low sand ridges. White birds-in-a-nest
and Florida skullcap occur in grassy pinelands and savannahs; Godfrey's butterwort occurs in savannahs, bogs, and
seasonal ponds. Three of the four species occur in Apalachicola National Forest, where ongoing management, especially
prescribed burning, is needed to ensure that they are secure. Telephus spurge, which does not occur on public land,
and the other species outside of Apalachicola National Forest are threatened by habitat degradation due to lack of
prescribed fire and by forestry practices, including planting practices. The recovery plan calls for ensuring that
habitat for the three plants is appropriately managed in the National Forest and, to the extent feasible, privately-owned
habitat be protected through conservation easements or purchase by public conservation agencies.


Public Comments Solicited


The Service solicits written comments on the four recovery plans described. All comments received by the date specified
will be considered prior to the approval of the plans.





Authority:

 The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Notice of meeting.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Geographic Data Committee has organized a Framework Working Group to gather information for and create
the structure for a national geospatial data framework for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. The purpose
of the meeting is to receive public comments on different perspectives on the framework, and the need for and approaches
to providing elevation and cadastral data to the framework.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Admittance will be limited to the seating available. Persons planning to attend the meeting should contact Mr. Goreham
as described above.


As part of this effort the working group will hold open meetings to receive input from any interested parties. The public
is invited to prepare a presentation on any of the topics listed in the Summary section of this notice. Presentations
should be limited to 15 minutes. (Presentations may be limited to a shorter time if necessary so that all may be heard.)
An overhead projector and slide projector will be supplied. The working group will also accept written comments,
which should be received by Mr. Goreham before January 18, 1994.
This meeting is part of a series on developing a geospatial data framework for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure.
The framework will provide a minimum set of geographic data that is useful to a maximum number of users within any geographic
area or nationwide. Framework data will be produced to known standards in the fastest time frame possible and for the
most reasonable cost. Creation of such a geospatial data framework will eliminate much of the redundancy in data capture
by making available a basic set of geospatial data to which other data can be related. The framework data would be of
recognized quality and would be available in ``standard'' formats. The geospatial data framework also will provide
a means to integrate data from numerous collection activities in various agencies and will encourage data sharing
among different disciplines. The components of the framework will likely include digital ortho imagery, geographic
and cadastral reference systems, elevation, and spatial representations of transportation, hydrography, and
administrative and political units. This meeting will address elevation and cadastral data; subsequent meeting
will address the other themes.
The Framework Working Group consists of representatives of Federal, State, regional, and local government agencies
engaged in the collection, maintenance, and development of geospatial data. The working group will define the components,
identify the standards for the initial collection and maintenance, recommend a time frame for production and maintenance,
and develop a plan for funding a framework of geospatial data as the foundation for the NSDI.

Public Administration Assistance Program in Central and Eastern Europe (RFP: OP/A/EE-94-P-003
Due 02/28/94) POC Contact Point: Dana Doo-Soghoian, Contract Specialist, 703/875-1995, Contracting Officer,
Diane M. Howard





The following notice appeared in the Commerce Business Daily on Monday, December 20, 1993:

This notice is a reissuance of a notice published on 12/7/93 and is for the same RFP. Any requests for this RFP that have
already been submitted in response to the earlier notice will be honored, and a new request is not necessary.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is soliciting proposals for up to two contracts to provide
public administration services throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Activities under the contract(s) will be
focused primarily in Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Albania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and possibly
the republics of the former Yugoslavia, and secondarily, in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland.



Each contract term is expected to be for two years, with the option to extend the contract(s) for 50% of the level of effort
in the 2-year base period. The contract(s) will be based on a level-of-effort, and contract resources will be accessed
through individual Technical Service Orders (TSOs). In addition, the contract(s) will provide a set amount of funds
for equipment and U.S.-based training for which the Contractor will be logistically responsible. Contractor(s)
shall furnish qualified personnel to provide technical assistance and training in the field of public administration
in, but not limited to, the following categories of activity: public management training, personnel systems, organizational
management, budgeting systems, regulatory systems, transparency of process, accountability, decentralization,
intergovernmental finance, local self-governments, procurement, and future public administrators.



Given the scope of activities, USAID encourages proposals from consortia or organizations joining together under
one proposal. All responsible sources may submit a proposal to be considered by USAID. Proposals will be evaluated
in accordance with the selection criteria stated in the RFP, with award(s) based on the proposal(s) that are most advantageous
to the Government, cost and other factors considered. To help identify potential subcontractors, the RFP will contain
an attachment listing all organizations who requested the RFP up to the time the RFP goes to print. By providing a list,
USAID does not endorse any of the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID
verify the claimed status of the organizations known to USAID prior to the issuance of the RFP. All requestors are encouraged
to state in their requests for the RFP whether their organization is a small business or a disadvantaged enterprise.
USAID promotes participation of small business concerns and disadvantaged enterprises (firms owned by minorities
or women, historically black colleges and universities, college and universities with more than 40 percent Hispanic
American students, and private voluntary organizations controlled by minorities or women) as contractors or subcontractors.
Accordingly, the prime contractor(s) will make reasonable efforts to identify the use of such groups. All other selection

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>







<DOCTITLE>Abel J. Sands, M.D.; Denial of Application</DOCTITLE>




On May 14, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Abel J. Sands, M.D. (Respondent) of 316 South Midwest Boulevard, Midwest City,
Oklahoma 73110. The Order to Show Cause, which proposed to deny Respondent's application for registration pursuant
to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The
Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances to undercover agents
of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (OBN) for other than legitimate medical purposes; that
OBN took action against Respondent's state license to handle controlled substances; and that Respondent failed
to keep complete and accurate records of this purchasing and dispensing of controlled substances.



Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing and the matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge
Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on December
15, 1992. On September 8, 1993, the administrative law judge issued her findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended
ruling. On September 30, 1993, Respondent filed exceptions to the recommended ruling of the administrative law judge.
On October 12, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator.
Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Acting Administrator hereby issues
his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below.




It was proven at the hearing that on numerous occasions, Respondent wrote prescriptions to undercover agents in the
absence of a legitimate medical purpose. OBN first became aware of Respondent's prescribing practices after Respondent's
name arose in the course of an investigation into the street purchase of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance,
Valium and Xanax, both Schedule IV controlled substances. OBN agents posed as patients and visited Respondent's
office in an attempt to obtain prescriptions for controlled substances without legitimate medical reason. The OBN
agents conducted a total of seven successful undercover operations at Respondent's office between December 1988
and April 1989. On each occasion, the OBN agents were able to obtain prescriptions for Xanax without legitimate medical
purpose. All of these undercover operations were taped and transcribed.


On the first undercover visit on December 14, 1988, the undercover agent told Respondent that a friend from whom he
had been purchasing Xanax advised him that he could obtain a prescription for Respondent. The agent told Respondent
that the Xanax made him ``feel good.'' After initially refusing to provide the prescription, Respondent informed
the agent that he would make a patient chart for him, the charge for which would be $25.00. Respondent proceeded to perform
a cursory examination of the agent, which included taking his weight and blood pressure. The agent told Respondent
that he needed Xanax to ``function'' at work after he used cocaine. Respondent ultimately provided the agent with
a prescription for 60 Xanax, stating that writing for 100 would get him (Respondent) in ``trouble.''



OBN agents conducted similar undercover operations on six other occasions and obtained prescriptions for Xanax
each time. The lead agent testified, and the transcripts provided corroboration, that he never complained of any
medical problem which warranted the use of Xanax. The administrative law judge determined that Respondent did not
establish a physician-patient relationship with the OBN agents and concluded that none of the prescriptions at issue
was for a legitimate medical purpose.

<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The administrative law judge further noted that Respondent's taped comments to the OBN agents demonstrated that
he was aware of the illegitimacy of the prescriptions and was concerned that his conduct would become known to law enforcement.
As a result, the administrative law judge concluded that Respondent's contention that he issued the prescriptions
pursuant to a valid physician-patient relationship was disingenuous and did not ``bode well for the proposition
that [Respondent] is likely in the future to accept and discharge the responsibilities of a DEA registrant.''

Also proven at the administrative hearing was the fact that Respondent, after surrendering his DEA Certificate of
Registration and after his state controlled substance license had been suspended, was found to be in possession of
controlled substances. On January 29, 1990, OBN agents and DEA Diversion Investigators delivered to Respondent
an ``imminent danger letter'' from OBN, which suspended Respondent's state controlled substance registration.
The same day, Respondent signed a DEA Form 104, voluntarily surrendering his DEA Certificate of Registration. An
investigation by Medical Board investigators revealed that on June 4, 1990, Respondent was in possession of Equagesic
and Halcion, both controlled substances.

The Medical Board investigation also revealed that Respondent had failed to keep accurate records of his purchase
and dispensing of controlled substances. After a Medical Board hearing was scheduled, but before the hearing date,
the Medical Board proposed and Respondent accepted a five year probation period during which Respondent was prohibited
from prescribing, administering or dispensing any Schedule II or III controlled substances. On April 16, 1991, OBN
granted Respondent a state controlled substance registration limited to Schedules IV and V for the period of his Medical
Board probation.

The Acting Administrator also finds that on November 15, 1989, Respondent was indicted in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on seven counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 842(a)(1). This indictment was based
on Respondent's writing of prescriptions to the undercover OBN agents. Respondent was acquitted of all charges on
February 22, 1990, following a jury trial.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or deny
an application for registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.
Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State
licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting
research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws
relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance with applicable
State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the
public health and safety.

The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application
should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks,
M.D., 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly found that all these factors, with the exception
of 21 U.S.C. 823(f)(3), were relevant to a determination of whether Respondent's registration would be in the public
interest.

Two Oklahoma authorities which exercise control over the licensing of physicians, OBN, which issues controlled
substances registrations, and the Oklahoma Medical Board (Medical Board), which issues medical licenses, have
taken action against Respondent. With respect to Respondent's experience with dispensing controlled substances,
the OBN investigation clearly demonstrates that Respondent cannot be trusted to fulfill his responsibilities as
a DEA registrant. This conduct, combined with his recordkeeping violations as discovered by the Medical Board, indicates
that Respondent has not complied with Federal and State regulations relating to controlled substances.

Finally, Respondent's cavalier conduct when issuing prescriptions, as evidenced by comments made during the undercover
operations, is disturbing. As the Administrative law judge correctly noted, the transcripts clearly indicate that
Respondent was aware of the illegality of his actions. Respondent's knowledge of the illicit nature of his conduct
demonstrates that Respondent cannot fulfill the significant responsibilities which come with a DEA registration.
Additionally, it is further evidence that the public health and safety would be comprised were Respondent given the
opportunity to return to his prior conduct. After considering these elements, the administrative law judge concluded
that Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and recommended that Respondent's application
be denied.

On September 30, 1993, Respondent filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's recommended decision. In these
exceptions, Respondent took issue with the administrative law judge's reliance on the testimony of the OBN agent
and the transcripts of the undercover operations. Respondent maintained that the agent's credibility was damaged
given the discrepancies between his testimony before the grand jury and his testimony during the criminal trial.
The Acting Administrator finds, however, that the administrative law judge carefully considered these issues and
concluded that the alleged inconsistencies in testimonies did not affect the administrative hearing. The inconsistencies
were adequately explained by the agent at the administrative hearing. Furthermore, as the administrative law judge
correctly noted, some of the agent's statements which Respondent insisted were contradictory were not necessarily
inconsistent. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the transcripts of the undercover operations, the accuracy
of which was not challenged by Respondent, speak for themselves.

Respondent asserts that the administrative law judge did not base her opinion on all the evidence presented, and instead
relied exclusively on the transcripts of the undercover operations. This contention, however, is not supported
by the detailed opinion and recommended ruling prepared by the administrative law judge. The Acting Administrator
finds that the administrative law judge properly weighed the evidence presented by both the Government and Respondent.

The Acting Administrator agrees with the administrative law judge that, after considering the applicable factors
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and adopts her recommended
decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that Abel J. Sands' application
for registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective January 6, 1994.

This notice announces the application of Wyle Laboratories for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory
(NRTL) under 29 CFR 1910.7, and presents the Agency's preliminary finding.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice of Application



Notice is hereby given that Wyle Laboratories (WL) has made application pursuant to section 6(b) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, (84 Stat. 1593, 29 U.S.C. 655), Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1-90 (55 FR 9033),
and 29 CFR 1910.7 for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.

The address of the laboratory covered by this application is: Wyle Laboratories, 7800 Governors Drive, P.O. Box 077777,
Huntsville, Alabama 35807.

Regarding the merits of the application, the applicant contends that it meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for
recognition to certify products in the areas of testing which it has specified.

Wyle Laboratories states that its application demonstrates that for each specified item of equipment or material
to be certified, it has the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written
testing procedures, quality control and calibration programs) to perform testing and examination of equipment
and materials for workplace safety purposes to determine conformance with appropriate product test standards.
In summary, it claims that it has the experience, expertise, personnel, organization, equipment, and facilities
suitable for accreditation as an OSHA Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.

The Calibration Laboratory maintains, repairs, and calibrates more than 7400 pieces of test equipment. Test equipment
is available in the laboratory to perform the testing specified in the standard. If equipment is not available, it
may be purchased, rented, or leased only under specified, stringent conditions.

The applicant states that it has pertinent testing and certification experience. The Huntsville facility has been
conducting testing related to product safety for over 30 years. Since the commercial product safety market has only
recently become available, WL's experience has been in other markets including telecommunications. The applicant
states the WL has tested equipment to standards which compare with UL standards for which they are requesting accreditation
to test and certify as an NRTL. In addition, Wyle has had experience in the certification of products (although not
necessarily related to those required by OSHA), having been a certified Department of Transportation (DOT) Third
Party Testing Laboratory since July, 1985. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 6).

WL's Huntsville facility employs some 350 people and has about 320,000 square feet of engineering and test facilities
situated on 126 acres. The floor space of the Product Safety Testing and Certification Laboratory including the storage
and office area, is 2,700 square feet. Some twenty key personnel are presently assigned to this Division including
Calibration Laboratory and Quality staff. Product safety testing has been allocated 1,500 square feet of floor space.
If additional floor space is necessary for product testing, WL can expand into the 320,000 square feet that is available
at this facility. (See Exhibits 3.A.(1) and 2.A.(2), Appendices II and III, and IV).

WL has written testing procedures and has supplied examples of typical procedures for five of the test standards for
which it has applied for NRTL recognition. (See Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix VI).

Wyle Laboratories states that all instrumentation, measuring, and test equipment used in the performance of the
testing programs are calibrated in accordance with Wyle Laboratories' Quality Assurance Program. Standards used
in performing all calibrations are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by report
number and date. Where no national standards exist, the standards are traceable to international standards or the
basis for calibration is otherwise documented. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 10, and Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix
VIII, Section 12, and Appendix XII).

WL has submitted an unrestricted copy of its Quality Assurance Program Manual (Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix VIII) which
describes the overall Quality Assurance Program used at WL's Huntsville facility. The Manual includes various control
procedures.

Wyle Laboratories states that it will implement control procedures for identifying products which have been certified.
It will maintain a controlled and secure file for each product tested. This file will contain the technical and business
records of the test program, including the services agreement, test results, correspondence, transmittals, the
Factory Inspection Reports, and the product documentation. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 7).

The applicant further states that products bearing the Wyle label will be considered evaluated, certified, and listed
by Wyle. It will certify that these products are in compliance with the applicable safety standards to which they were
tested. Wyle will thereafter have unannounced and unrestricted access to conduct inspections at approximately
three-month intervals at manufacturing and other facilities where products certified by them may be fabricated,
processed, or stored. Wyle will conduct field inspections to monitor and assure proper use of its certification label
after the products are delivered to the end user. (See Exhibit 2.A(1), Sections 5 and 9, and Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix
XI).

WL states that its Product Safety Certification activities are performed completely independent of its clients.
No Wyle clients have ownership positions in Wyle or have any sort of influence on WL's activities. No WL employees are
under the influence or control of manufacturers or suppliers. (See Exhibits 2.A; 2.A.(1), Section 3; and Exhibits
2.A.(2), Appendix I).

The applicant appears to maintain effective procedures for producing creditable findings or reports that are objective
and without bias. (See Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendices IV and VIII).

Wyle asserts that its Appeals Procedure (see Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix X) includes a system which provides an unbiased
review of any controversial matter. The Appeals Procedure is available for any interested party, including users.

All other pertinent aspects of Wyle Laboratories' program are detailed in Exhibited 2.A and 3.A.



Background



The applicant states that Wyle Laboratories was founded in 1949 in El Segundo, California, as an independent test
laboratory to support the nation's fledgling aerospace industry. As manned spaceflight became a national priority
and support of spaceflight development was required, Wyle expanded to a new location in Norco, California, which
was dedicated in 1959. To complement the propellent and vibration testing capabilities of the California locations,
Wyle states that it created the Huntsville facility in 1962 to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) and the establishment of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, with testing,
engineering, and research capabilities. Of the three major operations at the Huntsville facility, the one of interest
to the NRTL Accreditation program is the Test Operations Division, which includes the Product Safety Department.
The Product Safety Testing and Certification Division of the Test Operations Division is responsible for the testing,
certification, and factory follow-up inspections of the products.

The applicant states that over its 42 year history, Wyle Laboratories_Scientific & Systems (3S) Group has expended
and diversified into various business disciplines. At the same time, the applicant states that the Company has continuously
maintained its independent laboratory status as a major provider of conformity assessment services to North America's
most quality-conscious industries. Wyle's focus continues to be on the science of evaluation, test and measurement
engineering, as well as the business of regulatory compliance.

Wyle Laboratories desires recognition for testing and certification of products when tested for compliance with
the following test standards:

Preliminary Finding



Wyle Laboratories addressed all of the criteria which must be met for recognition as an NRTL in its initial application
and in its further correspondence. For example, the applicant submitted a list of its test equipment and instrumentation;
a roster of its personnel including resumes of those in key positions and copies of position descriptions; copies
of a typical test report; a factory inspection form and an inspection summary; a summary of its listing, labeling,
and follow-up services; a statement of its independence as a testing laboratory; appeals procedure; typical calibration
forms; and a copy of its Quality Assurance Manual. This QA Manual includes a description of its document control; identification
and control of materials, parts, and components; inspection; test control; control of measuring and test equipment;
inspection, test, and operating status; quality assurance records; and audits.

Nine major areas were examined in depth during the on-site laboratory evaluation: Facility; test equipment; calibration
program; test and evaluation procedures; test reports; records; quality assurance program; follow-up listing
program; and personnel.

The discrepancies noted during the on-site evaluation were adequately responded to [Ex. 3.A.(2)] prior to the preparation
of the final on-site evaluation [Ex. 3. A.(1)]. With the preparation of the final report, the survey team was satisfied
that the testing facility appeared to meet the necessary criteria required by the standard, and so noted in the On-Site
Review Report (Survey). (See Ex. 3.A.)

Following a review of the application file and the on-site survey report of the WL facility, the NRTL Recognition Program
staff concluded that the applicant appeared to have met the requirements for recognition as a Nationally Recognized
Testing Laboratory and, therefore, recommended to the Assistant Secretary that the application be preliminarily
approved.

Based upon a review of the completed application file and the recommendation of the staff, the Assistant Secretary
has made a preliminary finding that Wyle Laboratories can meet the requirements for recognition as required by 29

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., et al., Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding
of No Significant Impact





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an extension to the latest construction
completion date specified in Construction Permit No. CPPR-149 issued to The Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company, et al., for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 2. The facility is located on the applicant's site in Lake County,
Ohio, approximately 35 miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio and approximately 7 miles northeast of Painesville, Ohio.






Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action




The proposed action would extend the latest construction completion date of Construction Permit No. CPPR-149
to November 30, 2001. The proposed action is in response to the applicant's request of October 28, 1991, as supplemented
on February 20, 1992.



The Need for the Proposed Action




The proposed action is needed because the construction of the facility is not yet completed and the licensee wants
to maintain the facility as a potential electrical power source.




Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action





Since the proposed action involves extending the construction permit, there are no radiological impacts associated
with this action. The impacts that are involved are all non-radiological and are associated with continued construction.
The impact of construction was evaluated in the Final Environmental Statement for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,
Units 1 and 2 (NUREG-0844, dated August 1982).



Based on the foregoing, the NRC staff concludes that the proposed extension of the construction permit would have
no significant environmental impact.




Alternatives Considered




A possible alternative to the proposed action would be to deny the request. Under this alternative, the applicant
would not be able to complete construction of the facility. This would result in denial of the potential benefit of
the facility. This option would not eliminate the environmental impacts of construction already incurred. If construction
were halted and not completed, site redress activities would restore some small areas to their natural state. This
would be a slight environmental benefit, but much outweighed by the economic losses from denial of the use of the facility,
if completed. Therefore, this alternative is rejected.



Another alternative is to take no action on the request for extension. The construction permit would not be deemed
to have expired until the application has been finally processed (10 CFR 2.109). In effect, the construction permit
could be in effect as long as no action was taken on a timely application for an extension. To take no action on the applicant's
request would not be responsive; therefore, this alternative is rejected.




Alternative Use of Resources






This action does not involve the use of resources other that those evaluated in the Final Environmental Statement,
NUREG-0884, dated August 1982, prepared as part of the NRC staff's review of the construction permit application.



Agencies and Persons Consulted





The NRC staff reviewed the applicant's request and applicable documents referenced therein that support this extension.
The NRC did not consult other agencies or persons.




Finding of No Significant Impact





The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this action. Based upon the environmental
assessment, we conclude that this action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.


For details with respect to this action, see the request for extension of October 28, 1991, as supplemented on February
20, 1992, which is available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, located at the Perry Public Library,
3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081.

<DOCTITLE>Iowa Electric Light and Power Co.; Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-49, issued to Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Duane
Arnold Energy Center (DAEC), located in Linn County, Iowa.



Identification of Proposed Action



The amendment would consist of a change to the Operating License that would increase the storage capacity of the spent
fuel pool to 3152 fuel assemblies, including a rack which can be used for temporary storage of 323 fuel assemblies.

The amendment to the TS is responsive to the licensee's application dated March 26, 1993, and supplemented by additional
correspondence dated September 15 and November 23, 1993. The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment
of the proposed action.



Summary of Environmental Assessment



The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor
Fuel'' (NUREG-0575), Volumes 1-3 (1979), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage
of spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation
of nuclear power with the accompanying spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommended
evaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis. For DAEC, the expansion of the storage capacity of
the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiological effects or nonradiological environmental
impacts beyond those assessed in the Commission's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in March 1973 related
to the operation of DAEC, and in the Safety Evaluation Report issued July 7, 1978, in support of a previous license amendment
concerning storage capacity.

The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expanded spent fuel pool is estimated to be less
than 2 percent of the total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facility relative to the requirements set forth
in 10 CFR part 51. Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological
impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have
no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, no environmental
impact statement needs to be prepared for this action.

For further details with respect to this action see

(1) The application for amendment dated March 26, 1993, and supplemental correspondence dated September 15 and November
23, 1993,

(2) The FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575),

(3) The FES for DAEC dated March 1973 and

(4) The Environmental Assessment dated December 29, 1993.

These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the Cedar Rapids Public Library, 500 First Street, SE., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401.

<DOCTITLE>Boston Edison Co., (Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



The Boston Edison Company (BECo, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DRP-35, which
authorizes the operation of Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station (the facility), at steady state power levels not in excess
of 1998 megawatts thermal. This facility is a boiling water reactor located in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The license
provides, among other things, that Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders
of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.



II



BECo is preparing to implement the Final Rule on Standards for Protection Against Radiation, 10 CFR part 20, on January
1, 1994. Section 20.1902(d) of the Final Rule specifies posting requirements for airborne radioactivity areas (ARA)
and  20.1003 defines an ARA based on the derived air concentrations (DAC) values of radionuclides provided
in Table 1 of Appendix B to 10 CFR part 20.



III



By letter dated September 13, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, from the DAC values
for Kr-89 and Xe-137 in Table 1 of appendix B to 10 CFR part 20 and provided alternative values in order to
use more appropriate specific DAC values for these radionuclides. The requested exemption would constitute a permanent
change to the Final Rule values for Kr-89 and Xe-137 for the facility.

Based on the NRC staff evaluation, it was calculated that the dose equivalent, in units of rem, that corresponds to
an exposure of 2,000 hours at the requested DACs of 10

^6

 uCi/cm for Kr-89 and 10

^5

 uCi/cm for Xe-137 is below the limiting dose values used for determining the radionuclide-specific DAC values
in Appendix B to 10 CFR 20.001-20.2402 (and in Federal Guidance Report No. 11). Therefore, the staff finds the
specific DAC values acceptable alternatives for use in place of the generic DAC value of 10

^7

 uCi/ml for these radionuclides when determining whether an area is, and requires posting as, an airborne radioactivity
area.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, the requested exemption from the DAC
values for Kr-89 and Xe-137 in Table 1 of Appendix A to 10 CFR part 20 and use of the values specified in the
licensee's request is authorized by law, and will not result in undue hazard to life or property. The exemption request
has been evaluated in a Safety Evaluation dated December 29, 1993.

Therefore, the Commission hereby grants BECo and exemption from the values in the Final Rule for Kr-89 and Xe-137
and approves the use of the proposed values in their request when determining whether an area is, and requires posting
as, an airborne radioactivity area. This exemption constitutes a permanent change to the applicability of the Regulations
in this regard for the facility.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (58 FR 68672 dated December 28, 1993).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc., (Indian Point Station, Unit 1); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



The Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., (the licensee), is the holder of Provisional Operating License
No. DPR-5 which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Indian Point Station, Unit 1 (IP-1). The
license provides, among other things, that the plant is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission
now or hereafter in effect.

The plant is a permanently shutdown light water reactor located at the licensee site in Westchester County, New York.



II



IP-1 has been shut down since October 31, 1974. There is presently no fuel in the reactor and, under the terms of
an April 14, 1977 amendment to License No. DPR-5 (Appendix A, Technical Specification 3.2.1), no fuel may be
loaded into the reactor core or moved into the reactor containment building without prior review and authorization
by the Commission. In addition, the Commission revoked authority to operate IP-1 by order dated June 19, 1980.
In order to reflect the permanently shutdown and defueled status of the plant, the NRC is granting an exemption from
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.120. This rule states the following:




 * * * each nuclear power plant licensee, by November 22, 1993, shall establish, implement, and maintain
a training program derived from a systems approach to training as defined in 10 CFR 55.4.




This exemption will relieve the licensee from all training program requirements of 10 CFR 50.120. However, it does
not relieve the licensee from previous requirements or commitments to train and qualify facility personnel.



III



The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are (1) authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances.

Section 50.12(a)(2)(ii) of 10 CFR part 50 provides that special circumstances exist when application of the regulations
in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the
underlying purpose of the rule.

The purpose of 10 CFR 50.120 is to ensure that civilian nuclear power plant operating personnel are trained and qualified
to safely operate and maintain the facility commensurate with the safety status of the facility.

The licensee in its letter dated July 31, 1993, addressed the special circumstances related to the NRC requiring the
Indian Point training programs to comply with 10 CFR 50.120. The reactor is permanently shut down, defueled, and the
fuel moved to the spent fuel pool.

The licensee has stated that the training requirements necessary to assure adequate protection of the public health
and safety in a permanently shutdown and defueled facility are significantly less than the training requirements
necessary to assure the public health and safety at an operating facility. The current Indian Point training programs
for the personnel categories required by 10 CFR 50.120 are as follows:



Non-licensed Operators



At Indian Point, non-licensed operators are known as ``Nuclear Plant Operators'' and are trained as part of the IP-2
staff. Their training specifically address the IP-1 systems that are required to remain in service and also
those that support IP-2 operations.



Shift Supervisor



The Indian Point shift supervisors are known as ``Senior Watch Supervisors.'' Individuals in this category are part
of the IP-2 staff and receive ongoing training under the IP-2 program, which includes training on IP-1
activities.



Shift Technical Advisor (STA)



The Indian Point shift technical advisor is known as ``Watch Engineer.'' Individuals in this category are part of
the IP-2 staff and receive ongoing training under the Indian Point IP-2 program, which includes training
on IP-1 activities.



Instrumentation and Control, Electrical, and Mechanical Maintenance



These individuals are part of the Unit 2 staff and receive training under the IP-2 training program. The IP-2
program contains training in IP-1 activities.



Radiation Protection and Chemistry Technician



These individuals are part of the IP-2 staff and receive training under the IP-2 training program. The
IP-2 program contains training in IP-1 activities.



Engineering Support



These individuals are part of the IP-2 staff and receive training under the IP-2 training program. The
IP-2 program contains training in IP-1 activities.

The tasks and activities associated with maintaining the fuel are relatively simple compared to the tasks and activities
required to maintain an operating nuclear power plant. Therefore, requiring IP-1 to comply with the literal
training requirements specified in 10 CFR 50.120 is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

The licensee contends that the regulation was established for power operation conditions because such conditions
could result in the potential for an accident with significant offsite consequences. In an NRC Show Cause Order to
Consolidated Edison dated February 11, 1980, the NRC stated that the NRC and the licensee had performed calculations
that showed that the spent fuel fission products had decayed such that, in the event of a loss of water from the spent
fuel pool, the fuel would adequately cool in air. Since February 11, 1980, the spent fuel radionuclides have decayed
an additional 13 years which further reduces the heat load in the event of a loss of water.

The staff has also determined that the tasks that remain to be performed by the IP-1 staff are fewer in number and
significantly less complicated than the tasks performed by the staff of an operating nuclear plant. Thus, the NRC
staff concludes the licensee justification for exemption is reasonable based on (1) the significantly reduced risk
to the public health and safety due to IP-1 being permanently shut down, and (2) the reduced number and complexity
of tasks to be performed by the IP-1 site staff.



IV



Based on the analyses presented in Section III above, the staff concludes that sufficient bases exits for approval
of this exemption. In addition, the staff finds that the special circumstance present satisfies the requirement
of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) in that requiring compliance with 10 CFR 50.120 is not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.



V



Based on the above evaluation, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(1), this exemption
is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common
defense and security.

Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants Indian Point Station Unit 1 and exemption to 10 CFR 50.120. This exemption
does not relieve the licensee of any other training requirements or commitments which they have made to the NRC.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (58 FR 67871, dated December 22, 1993).

This exemption is effective as of its date of issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Houston Lighting & Power Co. (South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



On March 22, 1988, and March 28, 1989, the Commission issued Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-76 and NPF-80
to Houston Lighting & Power Company, et al. (the licensee) for South Texas Project, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively.
These licenses provided, among other things, that the facilities are subject to all rules, regulations, and orders
of the Commission.



II



Appendix A of part 20 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, ``Protection Factors for Respirators,'' establishes
protection factors of air-purifying respirators for protection against particulates only. Furthermore, footnoted
d-2(c) states, ``No allowance is to be made for the use of sorbents against radioactive material in the form of
gases or vapors.'' This restriction was needed since an inadequate data base has existed for evaluating the complex
interaction of many factors affecting the service life and removal efficiency of radioactive gases and vapors by
sorbent canisters. Also, due to the lack of a data base, a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/Mine
Safety and Health Administration (NIOSH/MSHA) certification schedule has not been established to ensure that the
canisters meet acceptable performance criteria.

Section 20.103(e) of 10 CFR part 20 allows the Commission to authorize the use of respiratory equipment in lieu of an
NIOSH/MSHA certification when such an action is justified based on adequate testing of material and performance
characteristics.

By letter dated December 19, 1991, as supplemented by letters dated July 1, 1993, and November 3, 1993, HL&P requested
an exemption based on 10 CFR 20.501 to allow the use of radioiodine Mine Safety Appliance Company (MSA) GMR-1
canisters with a protection factor of 50 for personnel respiratory protection. In support of the exemption request,
HL&P cited test results and a quality assurance plan that satisfies the recommended qualification process of
NUREG/CR-3403, ``Criteria and Test Methods for Certifying Air-Purifying Respirator Cartridges and Canisters
Against Radioiodine.''



III



The NRC staff evaluated the information provided by HL&P. The licensee provided reliable test information verifying
that the MSA GMR-1 canister is capable of providing a protection factor of 50 over a period of 8 hours of continuous
use, provided that the total challenge of radioactive and non-radioactive iodine and other halogenated compounds
does not exceed 1 ppm, and temperature does not exceed 110
 F provided the dewpoint does not exceed 107
  F. The data showed the breakthrough point to be well beyond 8 hours.

Testing has been conducted under acceptable conditions of cyclic flow and under worst-case conditions for those
environmental factors affecting service life (i.e., temperature, relative humidity, and challenge concentration
of CH

3

I (methyliodide/methyl radioiodide), the most penetrating of the challenge forms). The data showed that the MSA
GMR-I canisters performed adequately under acceptable test conditions. These conditions, including criteria
and test methods, are consistent with those derived by the NRC staff from NUREG/CR-3403, ``Criteria and Test
Methods for Certifying Air-Purifying Respirator Cartridges and Canisters Against Radioiodine.''

HL&P, through acceptance of MSA QA controls, has provided commitments that the MSA GMR-1 canisters will
meet standards for quality assurance and quality control that are recognized by NIOSH and are compatible with NRC
staff positions. This includes a commitment to establish a 1 percent AQL (acceptable quality limit) in a 5 to 10 ppm
challenge concentration of CH

3

I, 90 percent relative humidity, 110
 F, 64 liters per minute cyclic flow, for a service life of 8 hours or more at a penetration equal to 1 percent of the
challenge concentration. Test data referenced by HL&P demonstrate that performance (i.e., service life) of
canisters at 100 percent relative humidity is acceptable.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.501, this exemption is authorized by law and
will not result in undue hazard to life or property.

Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section III above from 10 CFR part 20, appendix

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change by the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating To Extending the AUTOM Pilot Program



December 30, 1993.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 1, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx is requesting Commission approval to extend the Exchange's Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'') system,
a pilot program, until December 31, 1994. AUTOM is an electronic delivery system of small options orders to the Phlx
trading floor, with an automatic execution feature.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included states concerning the purpose of and
basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these
statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared
summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On March 31, 1988, the Commission approved the establishment of AUTOM as a pilot program.
 The Exchange currently is proposing to extend the AUTOM pilot program until December 31, 1994. The Exchange represents
that, from the date of the last Commission order extending the AUTOM pilot program, AUTOM has operated efficiently
and without any material problems being reported by Phlx members or AUTOM users.





The AUTOM system is an online system that allows electronic delivery of options orders from member firms directly
to the appropriate specialist on the Phlx options trading floor, with electronic confirmation of order executions.
Specifically, once AUTOM orders are entered into the system and routed to the specialists' post, they are executed
manually by the specialist who, upon execution of the order, enters the relevant trade information into the system.
An execution report is then automatically transmitted to the firm that placed the order.

The AUTOM system also has an automatic execution feature called ``Auto-X.'' Currently, Auto-X is available to public
customer market and marketable limit orders of up to 20 contracts. Orders eligible for automatic execution through
AUTOM are: (1) Printed in hard copy form at the floor representative booth of the delivering member organization;
(2) displayed on the trading crowd screen with buy/sell information omitted; and (3) printed in hard copy form at the
specialist post. The order is priced and executed automatically at the best displayed bid or offer, and the execution
is reported automatically to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). A report of the execution also is
electronically sent to the delivering member organization. Under Auto-X, the specialist is the contra-side of all
trades. However, the specialist is required to ensure participation of bids and offers on the limit order book and
in the trading crowd that are entitled to execution pursuant to the Phlx's rules of priority, parity, and precedence.

<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Phlx represents that, as a general matter, the AUTOM system has functioned well, servicing member firms options
orders. The Phlx states that two major groups of figures best reflect the performance of AUTOM: (1) The capacity figures;
and (2) the order flow figures.
 First, the Phlx believes that information regarding AUTOM's system capacity shows that AUTOM continues to have the
ability to service the volume of incoming orders. Specifically, the Phlx represented, in February 1993, that it would
make enhancements to systems capacity (

i.e., 

the ability of the system's hardware to properly route orders and service potential order volume) if order volume
during peak time exceeded 80% of CPU capacity. The Exchange represents that since making these representations with
respect to AUTOM's capacity, this 80% level has not been attained.





Second, the Phlx also believes that an analysis of current customer order flow demonstrates that the system capacity
is adequate to handle the current and potential number of orders transmitted through the system. Specifically, the
Phlx represents that only about two-thirds of all orders placed on AUTOM are executed because the other one-third
of the orders are too far away from the market to receive execution. The orders routed through AUTOM that receive execution
are either automatically executed through Auto-X or are manually executed by the receiving Phlx specialist.

Accordingly, the Phlx believes that AUTOM continues to facilitate smooth and liquid markets on the equity options
floor, and otherwise represents a favorable development for all concerned parties. The Phlx further believes that
AUTOM has performed well, servicing member firms' options orders.

The Phlx, therefore, believes that it is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
for the Commission to permanently approve the AUTOM system. Specifically, the Phlx believes that the current proposal
is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade
and to protect investors and the public interest.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change will not impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to section
19(b)(2) of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,
and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6 and 11A.
 Specifically, the Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation of the AUTOM system provides
for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in Phlx equity options through the use of new data processing and
communications techniques, thereby improving order processing and turnaround time. The Commission also believes
that the extension of the pilot program until December 31, 1994, will provide the Exchange with a better opportunity
to study its operation and effectiveness prior to permanent approval of the program.

<DOCNO> FR940106-2-00121 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940106-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission further notes that the Exchange has represented that from January 1, 1993 until present, AUTOM has
not suffered any operational failures and the Phlx has not received any formal complaints with respect to the system's
operation.
 Finally, since the pilot program is being extended without expansion of the scope of the pilot, the Commission does
not believe that the capacity of the Exchange's automated systems will be adversely effected by this extension.






The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to permit the Phlx to continue the AUTOM pilot program on an uninterrupted basis. Specifically, the Commission
believes that the Phlx's proposal to extend the AUTOM pilot program does not raise any new issues since it merely extends
the pilot program as it is currently operating. Further, the Commission believes that the pilot is beneficial in maintaining
the quality and efficiency of the Phlx's market. 
The Commission also notes that there have been no adverse comments concerning the pilot program since its implementation.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate
and consistent with Sections 6 and 11A of the Act. 


IV. Solicitation of Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change,
including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies
thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies
of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that
are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission
and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552,
will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW.,
Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of
the above mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption
above and should be submitted by January 27, 1994. 


It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-93-57) is approved through December 31, 1994.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

Coast Guard, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of eligibility.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (the Act) clarifies the criteria which determine when vessels are required
to be certificated by the Coast Guard for passenger carriage. To accomplish this, the Act, among other things, redefines
the terms ``passenger,'' ``passenger vessel,'' ``small passenger vessel,'' and ``uninspected passenger vessel.''
The Act also provides definitions for the terms ``passenger for hire'' and ``consideration.'' The Act establishes
an extension period for its applicability to charter vessels that will operate as charters with no crew provided.
The extension period is only available to those vessels whose owners make application to the Coast Guard by June 21,
1994. The Act further calls for the possible modification of existing requirements for certain charter vessels of
over 100 gross tons, and the establishment of new requirements for uninspected passenger vessels of at least 100 gross
tons carrying not more than 12 passengers. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Applicability 


Although most of the Act is effective immediately, it does not apply to passenger and small passenger vessels chartered
without a crew until six months after enactment. An additional 30 months extension of inapplicability is also available
for these vessels only. To receive this extension the vessel owner must: 
(a) Make application for inspection with the local Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) by June
21, 1994; 
(b) Make the vessel available for examination by the Coast Guard prior to the carriage of passengers; 
(c) Correct especially any hazardous conditions involving the vessel's structure, electrical system, and machinery
installation such as: (i) Grossly inadequate, missing, unsound, or severely deteriorated frames or major structural
members; (ii) wiring systems or electrical appliances without proper grounding or overcurrent protection; and
(iii) significant fuel or exhaust system leaks; 
(d) Equip the vessel with lifesaving and firefighting equipment, or the portable equivalent, required for the route
and number of persons carried; 
(e) Verify through stability tests, calculations, or other practical means (which may include a history of safe operations)
that the vessel's stability is satisfactory for the size, route and number of passengers; and 
(f) Develop a work plan approved by the Coast Guard to complete in a good faith effort all requirements necessary for
issuance of a Certificate of Inspection as soon as practicable. If a vessel qualifies for an extension, the Coast Guard
will issue a letter to the owner which establishes the conditions of operation for the vessel during the extension
period. The letter will specifically indicate the conditions of route, service, number of passengers, manning,
and equipment. 
Depending on the condition and outfitting of these vessels, the process to receive a Coast Guard extension letter
may take several weeks or months. Therefore, vessel owners desiring extensions are encouraged to apply early. Under
the Act, vessels chartered without a crew that carry more than 12 passengers, as defined by the Act, must have an extension
letter from the Coast Guard or have obtained a Certificate of Inspection to continue operations after June 21, 1994.



Possible Modified Regulations for Certain Existing Passenger Vessels 


The Act also permits the establishment of different structural fire protection, manning, operating and equipment
requirements for certain existing charter vessels if they are not necessary for safe operation. Such requirements
would apply to existing charter vessels carrying not more than 150 passengers on domestic voyages that are: 
(a) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons, and; 
(b) Former public vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 500 gross tons. 
These modified requirements will seek to ensure an equivalent degree of safety is achieved for those existing vessels
that cannot come into full compliance with the current passenger vessel regulations because of their construction.
To be eligible for these modified requirements, the owner of the vessel must: 
(1) Make application for inspection with the local Coast Guard OCMI before June 21, 1994; and 
(2) Provide satisfactory documentation that the vessel was chartered at least once within the period December 20,
1992 to December 20, 1993. 


New Regulations for Uninspected Passenger Vessels 


The new definition of the term ``uninspected passenger vessel'' will now include vessels of at least 100 gross tons,
that are: carrying not more than 12 passengers, including at least one passenger for hire; or, that is chartered with
the crew provided or specified by the owner or the owner's representative and is carrying not more than 12 passengers.
New regulations will be developed for these vessels within 24 months.

<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the Noise Compatibility Program submitted
by the county of San Joaquin, Stockton, California, under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise
Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On May 10, 1991, the FAA determined
that the Noise Exposure Maps submitted by under part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On November
22, 1993, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Noise Compatibility Program for Metropolitan
Oakland International Airport. Twenty-eight (28) of the proposed measures were approved, and two (2) measures were
disapproved.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the Noise Compatibility Program for Stockton
Metropolitan Airport, effective November 22, 1993.




Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a Noise Exposure Map, may submit to the FAA a Noise Compatibility
Program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the Noise Exposure Maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport Noise Compatibility Program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

a. The Noise Compatibility Program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;

b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and 

d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport Noise Compatibility Program are delineated
in FAR part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Burlingame, California.

The county of San Joaquin submitted to the FAA on February 28, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other
documentation produced during the Noise Compatibility Planning study conducted from May 1988, through October
1990. The Stockton Metropolitan Airport Noise Exposure Maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable
requirements on May 10, 1991. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 28, 1991.

The Stockton Metropolitan Airport study contains a proposed Noise Compatibility Program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to,
or beyond, the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a Noise Compatibility
Program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on May 26, 1993 and was required
by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an
approval of such program. 

The submitted program contained thirty (30) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA
completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR part 150 have
been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Airports
effective November 22, 1993. 

Outright approval was granted for twenty-eight (28) of the specific program elements. Two (2) elements were disapproved.
The approved elements included existing preferential runway usage, existing flight procedures, existing aircraft
category procedures, existing pattern procedures, practice circling maneuvers, education of airport users, amend
county development title, residential/nonresidential noise sensitive land use exclusion area, sound attenuation
in new construction, acoustical studies, real estate disclosure, residential soundproofing program, noise abatement
departures, informational signs, noise abatement advisories, noise abatement hotlines, interagency coordination
procedures, review committee, amend airport land use plan, and Weston Ranch easement area. 

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Acting Assistant Administrator
for Airports on November 22, 1993. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents
comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices
of the Santa Clara County.

<USBUREAU>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</USBUREAU>





American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Denial of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance



American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) of Torrance, California determined that certain passenger cars failed to
comply with 49 CFR 571.208, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' and filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. Honda also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy
requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.

Notice of receipt of the petition was published on May 21, 1993 (58 FR 29689). This notice denies that petition.

Paragraph S4.1.4.2 of Standard No. 208 requires that motor vehicles be equipped with seat belt assemblies that comply
with Standard No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies.'' Paragraph S4.3(j)(3) of Standard No. 209 requires that




An emergency locking retractor of a Type 1 or Type 2 seat belt assembly * * * shall not lock, if the retractor
is sensitive to vehicle acceleration, when the retractor is rotated in any direction to any angle of 15 degrees or less
from its orientation in the vehicle * * *




Honda determined that the seat belt assemblies for the rear outside seating positions of approximately 1.2 million
model year 1990, 1991, 1992, and early 1993 two-door and four-door Accords do not comply with S4.3(j)(3), the emergency
locking retractor requirements of Standard No. 209. When the vehicle in which the noncomplying belt is installed
is in certain parking positions such as on a steep uphill grade, the rear seat occupants are sometimes unable to pull
the belt out of the retractor, and thus cannot fasten their belts. The vehicle must be moved to a more level position
for the rear seat occupant to be able to put on the seat belt.

Honda supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following arguments:

In the petitioner's opinion, the noncompliance does not affect the occupant protection performance of the subject
seat belt assemblies. To verify this, Honda tested the belts to determine whether they meet the locking requirements
of Standard No. 209. All the belts complied with these requirements. Further, Honda performed dynamic sled test comparisons
of the noncompliant belts to complaint belts at a test speed of 30 miles per hour. Honda found that the performance of
the noncompliant belts was almost the same as that of the compliant belts.

Honda stated that the primary effect of the noncompliant seat belts is inconvenience due to the rear seat occupant's
inability to pull the belt out from the retractor under certain parking conditions, as when the vehicle is in a significant
uphill parking position in excess of 11 degrees, or when the vehicle has been parked such that one side of the vehicle
is substantially higher than the other (at least nine degrees). Honda argued that the opportunities for parking an
affected vehicle in this type of situation are very uncommon and would present a high level of discomfort to rear seat
occupants from sitting at this angle. Honda has found that when the vehicle is parked on ground at lesser angles than
previously noted, the noncompliant belts work completely normally.

Honda reviewed its consumer records for complaints relating to the noncompliance. It found that consumers had registered
a total of 173 complaints regarding the 4-door sedan and 34 complaints regarding the 2-door coupe. These complaints
are known to be related to the subject noncompliance, as the problem is clearly described in the complaint. In addition,
Honda received 168 complaints regarding the 4-door sedan and 46 complaints regarding the 2-door coupe which were
not clearly defined and may not be related to the subject noncompliance. The consumer complaint ratios, taking into
account only the known related complaints, are 0.026 percent for the 4-door sedan and 0.014 percent for the 2-door
coupe.

Since Honda offers a lifetime warranty for seat belts, it will replace, free of charge, any unit that has a functional
problem at any time during the life of the vehicle. In this instance, Honda will notify owners of the subject vehicles
that it will replace the sensor in the noncompliant seat belt retractors if the customer experiences the locking problem.


Honda concluded by stating that, although the noncomplying retractors may, in certain situations, result in the
belt not being able to be pulled out of the retractor, this is a temporary condition which is remedied if the vehicle
is moved from an uphill position of greater than 11 degrees or a lateral angle of greater than nine degrees. There is
no risk to safety once the belt has been successfully fastened, since the performance of the belts is equal to those
which are in total compliance with Standard No. 209. Because the seat belts have a lifetime warranty, any complaint
concerning the ability to activate the belts will result in Honda replacing the belt with no cost to the consumer. 

No comments were received on the petition.

Occupant protection has been a primary safety goal of the agency since its inception. Therefore, noncompliances
with occupant protection requirements are treated with particular concern. The noncompliance described in the
petition is one that occurs only under specific circumstances of vehicle attitude. That these circumstances are
not isolated and occur with a degree of frequency is borne out by the number of complaints that Honda has received. Generally,
a petitioner for a determination of inconsequentiality supports its arguments with the statement that no complaints
have been received. In this instance, there have been sufficiently numerous expressions of concern to cause Honda
to formulate a ``Product Improvement Campaign''. Honda has submitted to NHTSA a draft of its proposed letter to owners.
The letter does not address the safety issue to NHTSA's satisfaction. The agency is concerned that the average recipient
will not understand the safety-relatedness of the problem described in the letter. As a result, the recipient would
be less likely to respond to it than to a letter meeting the requirements of Part 577.

NHTSA has concluded that the noncompliance is one that will have the immediate effect of creating frustration when
the rear seat passenger is unable to pull the belt out of its retractor. This can deter the passenger from further efforts
to wear the belt until the vehicle is once more at an attitude at which the belt may be fastened, or even create the impression
that the belt is broken and that further attempts to dislodge it will be useless. Another possibility is that a parent
may be unable initially to secure a child safety seat, then neglect to get out of the car to secure it when the vehicle
is moved. 

Alternatively, the parent may respond by moving the child seat from the rear seat position to the front. This would
be contrary to the agency's policy of encouraging parents to install child safety seats in the rear in view of the greater
safety of that location. In NHTSA's view, any noncompliance that has the potential to decrease the chances of use of
a seat belt is not one that is inconsequential. Therefore, both the notification letter and the remedy must be in accordance
with Federal requirements.

In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that the petitioner has not met its burden of persuasion that
the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is
denied.

<DOCTITLE>Theft Data; Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Publication of final theft data.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document publishes the final data on passenger motor vehicle thefts that occurred in calendar years 1990-1991.
As provided in the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, these data were used to determine the theft rates for existing passenger
motor vehicle lines manufactured in model years 1990 and 1991 and to determine the median theft rate for all those lines.
Vehicle lines with theft rates exceeding the median theft rate of 3.5866 per thousand vehicles produced, are subject
to selection for coverage under the Theft Prevention Standard.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Original Base Median Theft Rate (1983-1984 Median Theft Rate)



The Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Theft Act), added title VI to the Motor Vehicle Information and
Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act). Pursuant to title VI, NHTSA promulgated 49 CFR part 541, Federal Motor Vehicle
Theft Prevention Standard. Part 541 establishes performance requirements for inscribing or affixing vehicle identification
numbers (VINs) onto certain major original equipment and replacement parts of high theft lines of passenger motor
vehicles.

Section 603 of the Cost Savings Act, as originally enacted, specified three categories of car lines that were high
theft lines within the meaning of title VI. These three types were:

Existing lines that had a theft rate exceeding the median theft rate for calendar years (CYs) 1983-1984 (section
603(a)(1)(A));

New lines that were likely to have a theft rate exceeding that median theft rate (section 603(a)(1)(B)); and

Lines with theft rates below the median theft rate, but which had a majority of major parts interchangeable with lines
whose theft rate exceeded or was likely to exceed the median theft rate (section 603(a)(1)(C)).

Section 603(b) of the Cost Savings Act provided that the median theft rate was the combined rate determined for CYs
1983-1984. Section 603(b) also set forth the equation NHTSA must use to determine the theft rates for each of
the vehicle lines. After applying this equation to each existing line, NHTSA was directed by section 603(b) to rank
the lines by theft rates to calculate the median theft rate.

In a 

Federal Register

 document of November 12, 1985 (50 FR 46666), NHTSA published the final theft data reflecting passenger motor vehicle
thefts in CYs 1983-1984. In that document, NHTSA also explained how it decided on the data source to be used and
how it calculated the final theft rates. Based on its calculations, NHTSA determined that the median theft rate for
CYs 1983 and 1984 was 3.2712 thefts per thousand vehicles.



Request for Comments Concerning New Median Theft Rate (1990-1991 Median Theft Rate)



1. The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992



The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (ACTA), which became law on October 25, 1992, amended title VI, Theft Prevention, of the
Cost Savings Act. Title VI was amended to require the agency to calculate theft rates for passenger motor vehicle lines
for the CY 1990-1991 period and then to establish a new median theft rate, based on that same period.

Title VI was also amended to redefine ``passenger motor vehicle'' to include ``any multipurpose passenger vehicle
and light-duty truck that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.'' See Section 601(1) of title VI. Before
title VI was amended, ``passenger motor vehicle'' was defined for title VI purposes to include passenger cars only.
Given the new definition of ``passenger motor vehicle,'' NHTSA must calculate the CY 1990 and 1991 theft rates not
only for passenger cars, but also for multipurpose passenger vehicle (MPV) and light-duty truck (LDT) lines that
are rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less. Depending on their theft rates, certain MPV and LDT lines
may be determined to be likely high theft lines, and thus may be subject to the parts marking requirements of the Theft
Prevention Standard.



2. Preliminary Theft Rates of Vehicle Lines and Median Theft Rate



On August 5, 1993, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 41834), for review and comment, a document setting forth data on passenger motor vehicle thefts that occurred
in CYs 1990-91, including preliminary theft rates of vehicle lines and the preliminary median theft rate for
all lines. In calculating the preliminary CY 1990-1991 theft rates, NHTSA followed the same procedures it used
in calculating the 1983-1984 theft rates, with minor exceptions. The calculation procedure, based on National
Crime Information Center data and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of each stolen vehicle, was described
in the August 1993 document.

<TEXT>
 

Out of a total of 226 vehicle lines, NHTSA preliminarily determined that the median theft rate for CYs 1990-1991
was 3.6436 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. Of those vehicle lines with a theft rate higher than 3.6436, 90 were
passenger car lines, 17 were MPV lines, and 6 were LDT lines.

In Table I of the August 1993 document, NHTSA tentatively ranked each of the 226 vehicle lines in descending order of
theft rate. Public comment was sought on the accuracy of the data, especially production volumes of individual vehicle
lines. Public comment was also sought on the methodology used by NHTSA in determining the ranking of the existing passenger
motor vehicle lines.

Based on the preliminary data, NHTSA also published a Table III that listed the previously designated high theft lines
with theft rates that fell below the preliminary median theft rate of 3.6436. The agency noted that lines that are presently
listed in appendix A of 49 CFR part 541 as subject to the requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard will continue
to be so listed regardless of whether they fall below the median theft rate. This is because section 603(d) of the Cost
Savings Act provides that, except for exemptions from parts marking due to NHTSA-approved antitheft devices, the
agency may not ``render the standard inapplicable to any line which at any time has been subject to the standard.''

NHTSA explained that in selecting high theft lines based on the 1990/91 median theft rate, it will follow the procedures
it established in 49 CFR part 542, Procedures for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard. The
agency indicated that it contemplated that newly designated high theft passenger cars would be required to begin
to comply with parts marking requirements in MY 1995, but that compliance for high theft MPV's and LDTs might be delayed
to a later model year since determination of ``major parts'' for these vehicles has not yet been made.



Public Comments and Agency Response



In response to the August 1993 

Federal Register

 document, NHTSA received nine written comments, all from vehicle manufacturers. The commenters addressed four
subjects: NHTSA's methodology in calculating the 1990/91 theft rates, the specific preliminary theft data regarding
the respective commenter's vehicles, the agency's intention to require that newly designated high theft care lines
be marked beginning in model year 1995, and the effect of the 1990/91 theft rates on lines previously determined high
theft.



1. NHTSA's Methodology in Calculating Rates



NHTSA received on comment on its methodology in calculating the new theft rates. Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen)
stated its belief that ACTA sought to alleviate chop-shop related vehicle thefts. It therefore recommended that
only thefts relating to chop-shop activities be counted in determining theft rates.

While chop-shop-related thefts may have been Congress' primary concern in enacting the Theft Act, the relevant language
in that Act (which remained unaltered in the ACTA) directs NHTSA to calculate the theft rate of a passenger motor vehicle
line using a fraction with `` the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line * * *'',
as the numerator. (See section 603(b)(1).) The statute does not direct the agency to make theft motive distinctions
such as those suggested by Volkswagen.

Therefore, NHTSA does not believe it appropriate to only use chop-shop related theft data in calculating theft rates
for a particular line, or the median theft rates for a particular line, or the median theft rate of all lines. The final
data published in this document calculates theft rates for each particular line, using all reported new passenger
motor vehicle thefts for that line, in CY 1990 and 1991.



2. NHTSA's Calculated Theft Rates of Individual Lines



NHTSA received comments from the following seven manufacturers concerning the listing of certain vehicle lines
and preliminary data presented in the August 1993 document: Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler), Fiat Auto R&D
U.S.A. (Fiat), Ford Motor Company (Ford), Mazda (North America), Inc., Nissan Research and Development, Inc. (Nissan),
American Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki), and Volkswagen.

Chrylsler requested that the Chrysler LeBaron line be separated into three lines, to differentiate among the LeBaron
Landau 4-door sedan, the LeBaron 2-door coupe and the LeBaron convertible. NHTSA agrees that the LeBaron line should
be separated, but only into two lines. Since the 2-door coupe and the convertible are built on the same platform, the
agency considers the vehicles to be in the same line, the LeBaron Coupe/Convertible. The LeBaron 4-door sedan is in
a separate line, the LeBaron Sedan.

Chrysler also stated that the Chrysler New Yorker is more accurately listed as the ``New Yorker 5th Avenue/Imperial.''
Listing the 1990/91 New Yorker line as the New Yorker 5th Avenue/Imperial makes that line distinct from the LH series
New Yorker, that Chrysler introduced in model year 1994. NHTSA concurs with this comment.

Ford commented that only 16 percent of its model year 1990 and 1991 E150 light duty truck line had a gross vehicle weight
rating (GVWR) of 6,000 lbs. or less, and that model year 1996, each vehicle in its E150 line will be over 6,000 lbs. GVWR.
Thus, by model year 1996, that company's E150 light duty trucks will not meet the ACTA's definition of ``passenger
motor vehicle,'' since they will have a GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds. Ford stated that it assumes that the effective
date of the parts marking standard for MPV's and LDT's will be no earlier than the 1996 model year and that, therefore,
it has concluded that no E150 vans will be subject to parts making. As discussed below, NHTSA has decided that manufacturers
of liens designated as high theft pursuant to the 1990/91 median theft rate must begin marking their vehicles in model
year 1996. The agency agrees that if the Ford E150 line does not fall within the statutory definition of ``passenger
motor vehicle,'' the vehicles are not subject to the theft prevention standard.

Mazda noted two errors concerning the listing of Mazda lines in Table III of the August 1993 

Federal Register

 document. As discussed above, Table III listed the previously designated high theft lines with theft rates that fell
below the preliminary median theft rate. The Mazda 323/Protege line was erroneously listed as a high theft line, and
the Mazda 929 was not listed. NHTSA has corrected the table for this document by removing the 323/Protege and including
the 929.

Volkswagen noted that Table III listed the ``Quattro,'' which that company assumed refers to the Audi V8 Quattro Sedan.
Since the line was determined by NHTSA to be likely low theft, Volkswagen asked that the line be removed from Table III.
NHTSA concurs that listing the ``Quattro'' in Table III was an error, and has removed it from the final data.

Commenters also identified several typographical errors in the theft data presented in the August 1993 document.
In light of those comments, the agency has corrected the theft rate for the Ford Tempo and Nissan NX Coupe, and the 1990
production number for the Suzuki Sidekick. NHTSA has also corrected production data for the Jetta line for model year
1991, based on Volkswagen's comment. Based on comments from Rolls-Royce, NHTSA added three Rolls-Royce lines. Two
Maserati lines were also added. No thefts were reported for any of the Rolls-Royce or Maserati lines in 1990 or 1991.

Suzuki provided model year 1990 production numbers for the Chevrolet Sprint, Firefly and GEO Metro (including production
numbers for both the hardtop and convertible models) lines. The Sprint is sold in Puerto Rico as the Firefly. General
Motors (GM) has already provided NHTSA with production figures for the Chevrolet Sprint (including the Firefly).
Since GM certifies compliance with the theft prevention standard for the Sprint line, NHTSA will base the final theft
rates for these lines using GM's production numbers.

GM also certifies theft standard compliance for the GEO Metro. GM's data, however, did not include production numbers
for the convertible GEO Metros. Therefore, the final theft rates for the GEO Metro reflect the additional information
provided by Suzuki.

In addition to the above changes, NHTSA is making the following corrections to the list of high theft lines with theft
rates below the median theft rate. Two lines that were inadvertently omitted, the Saturn SC and Lotus Elan, are added.
One line that was inadvertently included, the Mercedes-Benz 129 line, is removed.

Fiat noted that the production figures shown in the agency's August 1993 document correspond to the figures in the
1990 and 1991 model year CAFE reports, and expressed the belief that NHTSA's theft regulation requires theft marking
subjection to be based on actual calendar year production. As indicated above, the equation that NHTSA must use in
determining the theft rates for each vehicle line is set forth in section 603(b) of the Coast Savings Act. That section
provides that the agency is to use ``the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of
[a] line (as reported to the Environmental Protection Agency under title V of this Act) which are of [two specified]


model years.

'' (Emphasis added.) Therefore, it is correct to use model year production figures rather than the calendar year production
figures suggested by Fiat.



3. Implementation Date



Four commenters discussed whether, for the new vehicle lines determined to be high theft based on the CY 1990-1991
theft data, parts marking should begin in MY 1995. Each of the four commenters, Honda, Nissan, Toyata, and Volkswagen,
asked that the required marking begin with MY 1996. Essentially, each manufacturer stated it needed more leadtime
to be able to comply, and it would be a hardship to begin marking in MY 1995. Some commenters cited start up difficulties
since they would be parts marking for the first time. Volkswagen noted that for some manufacturers, requiring parts
marking in model year 1995 may not provide enough leadtime for the manufacturers to be able to submit timely petitions
for exemption from parts marking, pursuant to part 543, Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard.

Based on these comments, NHTSA has decided that requiring parts marking in MY 1995 for the new vehicle lines determined
to be high theft based on the CY 1990-1991 theft data would impose an undue burden on manufacturers. The agency
also agrees with Volkswagen that requiring newly designated high theft lines to be marked beginning with model year
1995 may not permit some manufacturers to submit timely petitions for exemption from parts marking for its vehicle
lines, pursuant to part 543. Section 543.5(b)(4) requires a manufacturer to submit a petition ``at least 8 months
before the commencement of production of the line(s).'' For a manufacturer which plans to introduce its model year
1995 lines in the summer of 1994, Part 543 petitions may already be due at NHTSA. Delaying parts marking to model year
1996 would permit all manufacturers to submit timely petitions for exemption from parts marking.

For these reasons, NHTSA plans to apply the parts marking requirement for newly designated high theft lines, including
cars and MPV's/LDT's, pursuant to the 1990/91 median theft rates, beginning with model year 1996. This expectation
will be reflected in a future rulemaking to amend the Theft Prevention Standard.



4. Effect of 1990/91 Median Theft Rate on Lines Previously Determined To Be High Theft



Nissan made several observations regarding the effect of the 1990/91 median theft rate on Nissan vehicle lines previously
determined to be high theft. NHTSA confirms Nissan's understanding that the Infiniti Q45, although ranked no. 177
in the final theft rates, continues to be a high theft line subject to the theft prevention standard. Section 603(a)(5)
of the ACTA provides that any line subject to parts marking when the original Motor Vehicle Theft Act was enacted continues
to be so subject, and that the only exemptions are for vehicles with NHTSA-approved antitheft devices. See also section
603(d). In model year 1990, the Infiniti Q45 was granted an exemption from parts marking, based on a standard antitheft
device on all vehicles in the line. (See 53 FR 45181; November 8, 1988.) Thus, Nissan may continue to place the antitheft
device on all vehicles in the Q45 line, in lieu of parts marking.

NHTSA also confirms that the publication of this final theft data has no effect on the Nissan Infiniti J30, which was
not yet introduced in 1990 or 1991. The Infiniti J30, a high theft line introduced in model year 1993, was also granted
an exemption from parts marking, beginning with model year 1993. (See 56 FR 47983; September 23, 1991.)



Final Theft Data and Final Median Rate



In Table I of this document, the agency lists each of the 231 vehicle lines manufactured in model years 1990 and 1991
in descending order according to theft rate. Based on the data set forth in Table I, NHTSA has determined the final median
theft rate for 1990 and 1991 to be 3.5866 thefts per 1000 vehicles produced. The final median is the theft rate ranked
116th (3.5866 thefts per thousand) in the table, according to the instructions in section 603(b)(2) of the Cost Savings
Act.

If NHTSA has not previously determined the line to be high theft, each line shown in positions 1 through 115, inclusive,
in Table I, will be subject to selection as a high theft line. In selecting high theft lines based on the 1990/91 median
theft rate, NHTSA will follow the procedures it established in 49 CFR part 542 Procedures for Selecting Lines to be
Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard, and provide affected manufacturers an opportunity to comment on NHTSA's
preliminary determination that a line is high theft. Final selection by NHTSA will mean that the vehicles in these
lines and their major replacement parts will have to be marked as specified in 49 CFR part 541, the vehicle theft prevention
standard, beginning with model year 1996.

In addition, Table II of this document lists previously designated high theft lines with theft rates below the median
theft rate of 3.5866, and Table III lists lines that have theft rates above the median theft rate and have major parts
interchangeable with those of lines that have theft rates below the median theft rate.
