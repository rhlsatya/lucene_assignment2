ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule revises the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) regulations governing
the Agricultural Conservation Program (ACP), Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), and the Forestry Incentives
Program (FIP). This proposed rule incorporates amendments made to the ACP, ECP, and FIP; revises procedures to reflect
current policies; and incorporates the Water Quality Incentive Projects (WQIP) into the ACP.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Paperwork Reduction Act 



Information collection requirements contained in the current regulation at 7 CFR part 701 have been approved by the
Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Number 0560-0082.
ASCS will resubmit these requirements to OMB for review in light of the amendments set forth in this proposed rule.




Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the Department,
it has been determined that this proposed rule: 

(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 

(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 

(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.



Federal Assistance Program 



The titles and numbers of the Federal Assistance Programs, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,
to which this rule applies are: Agricultural Conservation Program (ACP)_10.063; Emergency Conservation Program
(ECP)_10.054; and Forestry Incentives Program (FIP)_10.064. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this rule since ASCS is not required
by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter
of this rule. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality
of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental
Impact Statement is needed. 


Executive Order 12372 



This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 
48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule
are not retroactive and preempt State laws to the extent they are not consistent with the provisions of this proposed
rule. Before any judicial action may be brought regarding the provisions of this proposed rule, the administrative
appeal provisions of 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. 



Background 



The ACP is authorized generally by Sections 7-17 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act as amended
(the Act) (16 U.S.C. 22590g 

et seq.

). The program provides financial and technical assistance to encourage agricultural producers to voluntarily
perform enduring soil and water conservation, water quality, and pollution abatement measures, including practices
or programs which are deemed essential to maintain soil productivity, prevent soil depletion, maintain water quality,
or prevent increased cost of production. 

A WQIP is authorized by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3831 

et seq.

). However, Congress funded WQIP as a part of the ACP. Accordingly, the WQIP is a voluntary incentive program conducted
pursuant to the Act to develop and implement 
agricultural water quality protection plans on up to 10 million acres.

The ECP is authorized by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2201 

et seq.

). This program is designed to provide cost-share assistance for emergency restoration work to meet only the critical
needs of agricultural producers due to drought or other natural disaster. 

The FIP is authorized by section 4 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2103) and is designed
to increase the nation's supply of timber products from private nonindustrial forest lands. The purpose of FIP is
to encourage private landowners to apply forestry practices that will provide for afforestation of suitable open
lands and reforestation of cut-over or other nonstocked forest lands and to encourage intensive multi-purpose forest
resource management and protection so as to provide for cost-effective timber production and other related forest
resources needs. 

The regulation governing these programs is being restructured and simplified to provide an easier and more effective
structure for the use of this regulation. The ACP is being revised to: 

(1) Incorporate several amendments that have been published in the 

Federal Register

; 

(2) Incorporate the WQIP; 

(3) Clarify that producers wanting to participate with practice WP4, Agricultural Waste Control Facilities, must
have been in operation for at least 5 years; 

(4) Adjust the LTA payment limitation to reflect that the payment limitation shall be based on the number of years remaining
on the LTA; and 

(5) reflect that payments shall be based on attribution. The ECP is being revised to: 

(1) Reflect that the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 
(16 U.S.C. 2202) authorized assistance for confined livestock operations; and 

(2) Define land subject to frequent damage which is ineligible for cost-share assistance. 




The FIP is being restructured for clarity. 




Currently, ACP practices are prioritized locally by county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation committees
to ensure that the most severe conservation and environmental problems are addressed. However, this county committee
prioritization process has been criticized as not addressing the most severe conservation and environmental problems.
Therefore, comments are requested regarding the manner in which ACP practices and allocation of funds could be prioritized
to achieve greater conservation and environmental benefits at the least Federal cost. Although not exclusive, such
considerations for prioritization may be based on temporary versus longer-term practices or type of conservation
or environmental benefit. Further, consideration should be given to whether priorities should be established by
the National, State, or county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices. Moreover, for ACP,
ECP and FIP, comments are requested on ways in which the programs can best be targeted in order to ensure that public
benefits, rather than private benefits are maximized with Federal expenditures. For example, the use of ACP for temporary
practices may not provide large public benefits. 

Comments are requested as to whether funds should be targeted toward designated areas with impaired water quality.
Similarly, cost-share practices could be selected for a region where they will contribute to an identified problem.
Thus, nutrient management practices would be designated as a cost-share option in areas where nutrients have been
identified as a water quality problem.

The regulations in part 796 of this chapter prohibiting the making of payments to program participants who harvest
or knowingly permit to be harvested for illegal use, marijuana or other such prohibited drug-producing plants on
any part of the land owned or controlled by such program participants are applicable to these programs. 



 701.5 



Practice specifications. 



(a) Minimum specifications that practices must satisfy to be eligible for cost-share assistance shall be set forth
in the county program within the authority established by the STC and Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations
(DASCO) or incorporated by specific reference to a standard publication or other written document containing such
specifications. 

(b) Practice specifications shall represent the minimum levels of performance needed in order for the practice to
be effective in meeting the program objective. Cost-share assistance shall be limited to these minimum levels. 



 701.6 



Responsibility for referred technical phases of practices. 



The SCS and the FS are responsible for technical phases of practices as assigned and such assignment will be specified
in State and county programs. 

(a) The SCS State Conservationist may use the expertise from private consultants, State, or Federal agencies in performing
the assigned responsibilities if SCS certifies that assigned practices are completed properly. No responsibilities
will be assigned for counties when DASCO and the Chief, SCS, determine that it would not be administratively practicable
for the SCS to discharge such responsibilities. In such counties, these responsibilities shall be assumed by COC's.
The SCS may utilize resources of the State forestry agencies in performing assigned responsibilities for practices
involving the establishment of windbreaks or shelterbelts on farmland to prevent wind erosion. 

(b) The FS is responsible for the technical phases of practices or components of practices involving the planting
of trees for forestry purposes and those involving the improving or protecting of a stand of forest trees as specified

Repair, upkeep, and maintenance of practices. 



Cost-share assistance shall not be authorized for repairs or for normal upkeep or maintenance of any practice. 



 701.9 



Public benefits when installing practices. 



Persons responsible for any aspect of performing practices shall install the practices to promote public 
benefits by: 

(a) Improving or preserving environmental quality and ecological balance by preventing or abating pollution and
other environmental degradation; 

(b) Benefiting the community by such means as preserving open space or enhancing the appearance of the area; 

(c) Benefiting wildlife and other desirable life forms; 

(d) Preserving historic, archeological, or scenic sites, wetlands, ecologically critical areas, and prime farmlands;


(e) Avoiding the creation of hazards to persons or animals; and 

(f) Avoiding actions that may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or flood plains. 



 701.10 



Payments for uncompleted practices. 



Cost-share assistance approved under these programs shall not be considered earned until all components of the approved
practice are completed according to applicable specifications and program provisions. Cost-share assistance
for completed components of an approved practice may be paid only on the condition that the eligible participant will
complete the remaining components of the practice within the time prescribed by the COC regardless of whether cost-share
assistance is offered for them unless the COC subsequently determines they are prevented from doing so because of
reasons beyond their control. 



 701.11 



Practices involving the establishment or improvement of vegetative cover. 



(a) Costs may be shared even though an adequate stand is not established, for practices involving the establishment
or improvement of vegetative cover, including trees, if the COC determines, according to standards approved by the
STC, that the practice was carried out in a manner which could normally result in the establishment of an adequate stand
and that failure to establish an adequate stand was due to weather or other conditions beyond the control of the participant.
The COC may require, as a condition of cost-share assistance in such cases, that the area be reseeded or replanted or
that other needed protective measures be performed. Cost-share assistance in such cases may also be approved for
repeat applications of measures previously performed or for additional eligible measures. Cost-share assistance
for such measures may be approved to the extent such measures are needed to ensure an adequate stand even though the
measures may be less than that required by the applicable practice wording for initial approvals. 

(b) In the case of FIP, replanting of trees is required where the landowner received cost-share assistance for site
preparation. 



 701.12 



Failure to meet minimum requirements or failure to comply fully with program provisions. 



(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of these programs, costs may be shared for performance actually rendered even
though the minimum requirements for a practice are not satisfied, if the participant establishes to the satisfaction
of the COC and the county representative of any other agency having responsibility for technical phases of the practice
that a reasonable effort was made to satisfy the minimum requirements and that the practice as performed adequately
solves the need for the practice.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, the Deputy Administrator may in accordance
with part 791 of this chapter authorize relief when a participant acting in good faith failed to fully comply with the
program provisions. 



 701.13 



Practices carried out with aid from ineligible persons. 



Financial assistance which is made available, or will be made available, to a program participant from a person ineligible
for cost-share assistance under this part for the practice, including aid from a State or Federal agency other than
aid made available under this part, shall be deducted from the program participant's total costs incurred for the
practice for purposes of determining the applicant's eligible reimbursable costs under this part. 



 701.14



Division of cost-share assistance. 



(a) The cost-share assistance shall be credited to the participant who performed the practice. If more than one person
contributed to the performance of the practice, the cost-share assistance for the practice shall be divided among
those persons in the proportion that the COC determines they contributed to the performance of the practice. In making
this determination, the COC shall consider the value of the labor, equipment, or material contributed by each person
toward performance. 

(b) The allowance by an eligible person of a credit to another eligible person in the form of an adjustment in rental,
an exchange of cash or other consideration shall not be considered as a contribution to the performance of any practice,
unless ASCS is satisfied that such credit is directly related to the cost of the practice. A person fully reimbursed
through an adjustment in rental, an exchange of cash, or other consideration shall not be considered as having contributed
to the practice performance. 



 701.15 



Applying cost-share assistance limitations. 



(a) All or any part of cost-share assistance which otherwise would be due any participant for a program year may be withheld,
or required to be refunded, if, with respect to that program year, the participant has adopted, or participated in
adopting, any scheme or device designed to evade a maximum cost-share limitation. 

(b) The provisions of 7 CFR 1497.109(a), which provide that payments shall be attributed to each member of an entity,
shall apply in determining whether certain individuals or other entities are to be considered as separate persons
for the purpose of applying any maximum payment limitations provided for in this part. 



 701.16 



Persons eligible to file application for payment of cost-share assistance. 



Any eligible person as defined in   701.104, 701.202, and 701.302, who bore a part of the cost of an approved
practice, is eligible to file an application for cost-share assistance. For ACP practice WP4, Agricultural Waste
Control Facilities, an eligible person is one who has been in an operation from which the agricultural waste is produced
for at least 5 years. 



 701.17 



Time and manner of filing application and required information. 



(a) Participants shall submit to the county office the information needed to establish the extent of the performance
of approved practices and compliance with applicable program provisions. The time limits for submission of such

shall afford a full and fair opportunity to those eligible to submit the information within the period prescribed.
At least 2 weeks notice of any general time limit prescribed shall be provided to the public. 

(b) Other means of notification of program availability including radio announcements and individual notices to
the person affected, shall be used to the extent practicable. Notice of such time limits which are applicable to individual
persons, such as time limits for reporting performance of approved practices, shall be issued in writing to the person
affected. Exceptions to the time limits may be made in cases where failure to submit required forms and information
within the applicable time limits is due to reasons beyond the control of the farmer or rancher. 



 701.18 



Death, incompetency, or disappearance. 



In case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, any cost shares due shall be paid to the successor,
determined in accordance with provisions of the regulations in part 707 of this chapter.

 701.22 



Maintenance and use of practice. 



Each participant receiving cost-share assistance is responsible for the required maintenance and proper use of
the practice. Each practice shall have an established lifespan or minimum period of time that it is expected to function
as a conservation practice with proper maintenance. If ASCS determines that a practice has not been properly maintained
for the established lifespan, the participant receiving the cost-share assistance shall refund all or any part of
such cost-share assistance as determined appropriate by the ASC COC. Further, any agreement providing for cost-share
assistance will be terminated, with respect to the land on which the practice is located, if there is voluntary loss
of control of the land by the participant receiving the cost-share assistance and the person acquiring control of
such land elects not to become a successor in interest to the agreement. If the agreement providing for cost-share
assistance is terminated as a result of the voluntary loss of control of the land, each participant receiving cost-share
assistance under that agreement shall be liable for refunding to ASCS any cost-share assistance which has been received
with respect to the practice. In addition, such person shall forfeit any right to receive any further cost-share assistance
with respect to the land on which the practice is located. 



 701.23 



Actions defeating purpose of program. 



If the STC or COC determines that a participant has taken any action which tends to defeat the purposes of these programs,
the participant may be required to refund all or part of any of these program payments otherwise due or paid that participant
during the program year. These actions include, but are not limited to, failure to properly maintain or deliberately
destroying a practice carried out under a prior program year. 



 701.24 



Depriving others of cost-share assistance. 



If the STC or COC determines that any participant has employed any scheme or device to deprive any other person of cost-share
assistance, the participant may be required to refund all or part of any of these program payments otherwise due or
paid that person during the program year. A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation.




 701.25 



Filing false claims. 



If the STC or COC determines that any person has knowingly supplied false information or filed a false claim, that person
is ineligible for cost-share assistance under the program year with respect to which information or claim was filed.
False information or a false claim includes, but is not limited to, a request for payment for a practice not carried
out or for practices which do not meet the required specifications. Any amounts paid under these circumstances shall
be refunded and any amounts otherwise due the participant shall be withheld. The withholding or refunding of cost
shares will be in addition to any other penalty or liability otherwise imposed by law. 



 701.26 



Cost-share assistance not subject to claims. 



Any cost-share assistance or portion thereof due any participant shall be allowed without regard to questions of
title under State law, and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the
owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations issued by the Secretary governing
offsets and withholdings at part 1403 of this title shall be applicable to these programs.

 701.109 

Selection of practices. 



The practices to be included in the State or county ACP shall be only those practices authorized by Deputy Administrator
for which cost-share assistance is essential to permit accomplishment of the ACP objective. 


 701.110 

Levels and rates of cost-share assistance. 



(a) The maximum level of cost-share assistance for each practice shall be the percentage of the average cost of performing
the practice considered necessary to obtain the needed performance of the practice and established at a level such
that the participant will make a significant contribution to the cost of performing the practice. 

(b) Levels of cost-share assistance under annual agreements for each practice shall not be in excess of 
seventy-five (75) percent of the average cost of performing the practice as determined by the COC. Where the Deputy
Administrator determines a higher level of cost-share assistance is necessary to provide adequate incentive for
a participant to perform a conservation practice, the Deputy Administrator may specifically authorize a higher
level. See  701.116 for special provision for low-income farmers. 

(c) Levels of cost-share assistance under long-term agreements shall not be in excess of seventy-five (75) percent
nor less than 50 percent of the average cost for each practice as determined by the COC. 

(d) For the purpose of establishing rates of cost-share assistance, the average cost of performing a practice may
be the average cost for either a county or a part of a county as determined by the COC. 



 701.111 

Starting practices. 



Costs will not be shared for practices or components of practices that are started before COC approval. 


 701.112 

Method of approval. 



(a) The COC shall determine the extent to which Federal funds may be made available to share the cost of each approved
practice, taking into consideration the county allocation, the conservation and environmental problems in the
county, the land involved, and the practices for which requested cost-share assistance is considered by the COC as
most needed. The method approved shall provide for the issuance of notices of approval showing for each approved practice
the number of units of the practice for which the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the cost-share
assistance for the performance of that number of units of the practice. To the extent practicable, notices of approved
practices shall be issued before performance of the practice is started. No practice may be approved for cost-share
assistance except as authorized by the county program, or according to procedures incorporated therein. Available
funds for cost-share assistance shall not be allocated on a proportionate share basis; however, cost-share funds
shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most enduring benefits attainable. 

(b) Cost-share assistance may be approved under annual agreements or long-term agreements. 

(c) Annual agreements may be approved in all counties. Long-term agreements are limited to farms or ranches which
are within Soil Conservation Districts (or comparable districts) through which the SCS provides planning and technical
services, except: 

(1) Farms and ranches located within a county designated for the Great Plains Conservation Program (GPCP) are only
eligible if not covered by GPCP contract. 

(2) Farms and ranches not located within a Soil Conservation District or comparable district may be eligible for a
long-term agreement provided CPO's are developed by the farmer or rancher in cooperation with the SCS and approved
by an appropriate State official or, in cases where an appropriate State official is not available, approved by the
SCS. 



 701.113 

Long-term agreements. 



(a) The period of a long-term agreement shall be for not less than three (3) program years nor more than ten (10) program
years. The COC and the signors to the long-term agreement in consultation with the SCS representative shall mutually
determine the period of the agreement. 

(b) The long-term agreement will be based on a CPO for the farm or ranch or portion thereof which has been approved by
the Soil Conservation District or comparable district or for farms or ranches not located in a Soil Conservation District
or comparable district, by an appropriate State Official or the SCS, as applicable. 

(c) The long-term agreement will provide that the farmer or rancher will perform those measures in the CPO's which
are determined to be essential to meeting the basic conservation needs of the farm or ranch, or portion thereof, regardless
of whether cost-share assistance is approved for such measures. 

(d) The owner of the farm or ranch will be required to sign a long-term agreement regardless of whether that person contributes
to the cost of approved practices thereon except in cases where the long-term agreement consists wholly of integrated
crop management practices. 

(e) Any party to a long-term agreement who is not an owner of the farm or ranch shall provide assurance of control of the
land for the duration of the period of the agreement.

<TEXT>
 


(f) The level of cost-share assistance as provided in 
 701.110, in effect for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level in effect at the beginning
year of the agreement. The rate of cost-share assistance for payment purposes for such practice shall be based on the
average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is performed. 



(g) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to fully comply with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting
with the Soil Conservation District or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS,
the State or COC determines that the seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action. If the agreement is canceled,
the parties to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit
all rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case, no other refund or forfeiture provisions of these
regulations apply. 



(h) A long-term agreement may be revised according to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator by mutual agreement
between the parties to the agreement and the COC based on approved changes in the CPO's for the farm or ranch.

(i) An otherwise eligible person who acquires control of land under an approved agreement may elect to become a successor
in interest under such agreement. 



(j) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which loss of control has occurred and where the person
acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the agreement. If the loss of control
is for reasons beyond the control of the parties to the agreement, the COC will determine whether any cost-share assistance
previously paid shall be refunded; however, in no event shall the refund be greater than would be required in cases
where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary on the part of the signatories to the agreement,
the signatories will be jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all
rights to further payments, with respect to the land for which control is lost. However, a refund will not be required
for cost shares where the COC or the STC determine, after consulting with a representative of the SCS, that failure
to perform the remaining practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which have
been performed and that the completed practices have provided conservation benefits consistent with the cost shares
which have been paid. 



(k) An agreement may be terminated by the COC, after considering the recommendation of the Soil Conservation District
or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS if such action is in the public interest.
The COC will determine the amount of cost shares previously paid that shall be refunded. 



(l) An agreement may be terminated by the COC upon the written request of the participant to a long-term agreement where
no cost-share assistance has been paid for any of the scheduled practices and where the participant does not intend
to perform any of the scheduled practices. 




 701.114 



Replacement, enlargement, or restoration. 





The establishment or installation of a practice, for the purposes of the program shall be deemed to include the replacement,
enlargement, or restoration of a practice for which cost-share assistance has been allowed if the practice has served
its normal lifespan or if all of the following conditions exist: 



(a) Replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is needed to solve the related conservation or environmental
problem. 



(b) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of proper maintenance by the current operator. 



(c) The COC believes that the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice merits consideration to an
equal extent with other practices. 



(d) The replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is not being performed because the producer has
increased his operation to where these measures are needed to solve the increased conservation or environmental
problem. 




 701.115 



Pooling agreements. 





Eligible persons in any local area may agree in writing with the approval of the COC to perform designated practices
which will solve a mutual conservation, pollution, or other environmental problem on the land of the participants.
For purposes of eligibility for cost-share assistance, practices carried out under such an approved written agreement
shall be regarded as having been carried out on the land of the persons who performed the practices. 




 701.116 



Special provisions for low-income farmers and 
ranchers. 





(a) Except as otherwise provided in  701.110(c), the COC may approve in the case of low-income farmers and ranchers
as defined in this section a level of cost-share assistance of up to eighty (80) percent of the average cost of performing
practices. 



(b) A low-income farmer or rancher is one who as determined by the COC is a small producer whose livelihood is largely
dependent on the farm or ranch and whose prospective income and financial resources for the current year are such that
the low-income farmer or rancher could not reasonably be expected to perform needed conservation practices at levels
of cost-share assistance applicable to other persons in the county. 




 701.117 



Maximum cost-share assistance limitation. 





For each program year, the total amount which may be received by any person under this subpart for approved practices
shall not exceed $3,500 except that: 



(a) The total amount received for approved practices, including those carried out under pooling agreements, shall
not exceed $10,000; and 



(b) The total amount received under an ACP long-term agreement (LTA) shall not exceed the annual payment limitation
($3,500) multiplied by the number of years remaining in the LTA. The payment limitation in effect after the first year
of LTA or after an LTA payment has been made shall be equal to the lessor of the following: 



(1) The number of years remaining in the LTA times the annual payment limitation; or

(2) The difference between the LTA's maximum payment limitation and the ACP cost-share assistance previously earned
during the contract period. 




 701.118 



Completion of practices. 





Cost-share assistance for the practices contained in this part is conditioned upon the performance of the practice
according to all applicable specifications and program provisions. 




 701.119 



Time of filing payment application. 





Payment of cost-share assistance will be made only upon application submitted on the prescribed form to the county
office by a date established by the COC. Any application for payment may be denied if any form or information required
of the applicant is not submitted to the county office within the applicable time limit. 




 701.120

(b) The cost-share payments which may be made by ASCS for a practice under the program shall, subject to the maximum

payment amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section and any other limitation as may apply, be further limited
to the level of cost-share assistance established by the COC not to exceed: 
(1) Sixty four (64) percent of the first $62,500 of the eligible cost of restoring the loss; 
(2) Forty (40) percent of the second $62,500 of the eligible cost of restoring the loss; and 
(3) Twenty (20) percent of the eligible cost above $125,000 to restore the loss. 


 701.206 

Eligible costs. 


Upon determination that a person is eligible for ECP assistance, cost-share assistance may be authorized for all
reasonable costs incurred in the completion of the practice. Such costs may include personal labor, equipment, and
other such costs which are determined by the COC to be related to the costs of performing the practice. COC's shall limit
costs for the use of personal equipment to an amount that reflects out-of-pocket expenses. Expenses for personal
labor and personal equipment shall be less than rates charged by contractors who expect to make a profit for their efforts.



 701.207 

Filing requests. 


(a) The COC shall establish an enrollment period for filing cost-sharing requests immediately after the COC's authorization
or the Deputy Administrator's authorization in cases of drought to implement the ECP in the county. Such periods shall
be at least 30 days in length. Late-filed requests may be accepted by the COC in justifiable cases. 
(b) Costs will not be shared for practices or components of practices that are started before a request is filed with
the county office. 


 701.208 

Approving requests. 


COC's shall issue practice approvals only when: 
(a) Funds are available; 
(b) The requested practice has been determined eligible for cost-share assistance; and 
(c) The eligible person has indicated a readiness to start the practice. 


 701.209 

Pooling agreements. 


Pooling agreements may be used on the same basis as provided for at  701.115.

[Reserved] 


Subpart D_Forestry Incentives Program 


 701.300 

Program objective. 


The objective of the FIP is to help ensure a future supply of timber will be accomplished by encouraging landowners
to apply forestry practices for: 
(a) Production of softwood and hardwood timber and other associated forest resources to increase afforestation
of suitable open lands. 
(b) Reforestation of cutover and understocked forest lands. 
(c) Timber stand improvement. 
(d) Intensive multipurpose management. 
(e) Protection of forest resources. 


 701.301 

Designated counties. 


The STC in consultation with the State Forester will designate the counties or parts of counties in which FIP will be
operated. The following will be considered in making the designations: 
(a) The total acreage in the county devoted to desirable types of softwood and hardwood timber. 
(b) The estimated area in the county that is under eligible ownership. 
(c) The estimated acreage suitable for the production of forest products. 
(d) The availability of funds. 
(e) The enhancement of other forest resources. 


 701.302 

Eligible person, land, and ownerships. 


(a) An eligible person is a private individual, group, Native American Tribe or other native group, association,
corporation excluding corporations whose stocks are publicly traded, or other legal entity which owns eligible
land. Firms principally engaged in the manufacture of wood products are not eligible. However, forest landowners
who manufacture forest products on a part-time or irregular basis are eligible. 
(b) Eligible land is nonindustrial private forest land capable of producing at least fifty (50) cubic feet of wood
per acre per year. 
(c) Eligible farms are those not exceeding a total of 1,000 acres of eligible private nonindustrial forest land in
the United States or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. The STC with the concurrence
of the State Forester may approve cost-share assistance with landowners owning more than 1,000 acres but not more
than 5,000 acres of eligible forest land where it is deemed to be to the public's significant benefit. 
(d) Significant public benefits are primarily those resulting from cost-effective timber production with related
benefits to aesthetics, recreation, wildlife habitat, watershed protection, erosion reduction, and other resource
values. 


 701.303 

Program funds. 


(a) Each designated State and county will receive a share of the funds provided for the program. Funds will be distributed
on the basis of the forest production opportunities in each State, considering the acreage of private nonindustrial
forest lands, the number of eligible owners, the potential productivity of such lands and the need for reforestation,
timber stand improvement, other forestry management needs, and the enhancement of other forest resources. The Deputy
Administrator will allocate funds after consultation with representatives of the FS and a committee of not less than
five State foresters or equivalent State officials selected by a majority of the State foresters or equivalent State
officials. The STC will consult with the State forester when determining the allocation of such funds to the designated
counties. 
(b) A limitation on the amount of funds which may be obligated under long-term agreements shall be established by the
STC according to guidelines provided by the Deputy Administrator. 


 701.304 

Eligible practices and cost-share assistance requirements. 


(a)(1) Cost-share assistance may be available for the following National practices and authority: 
(i) Planting Trees. 
(ii) Improving a Stand of Forest Trees. 
(iii) Special Forestry Practices. 
(2) The Deputy Administrator after consultation with the FS, may approve special forestry practices needed to solve
a significant and unique local condition for which the National practices are not adequate. Such practices may be
approved for inclusion in a county program after consultation with the program development group and the recommendation
of the COC, the service forester, the STC, and the State forester. 
(b) A forest management plan is required as a condition for cost-share assistance. The Forest Management plan will
be developed in consultation with the landowner, approved by the service forester, and will contain information
for accurate evaluation of practice effectiveness. The participant will be required to perform those measures in
the Forest Management plan which are essential to the effectiveness of the practice for which costs are shared. In
the development of the Forest Management plan, consideration will be given to wildlife, watershed protection, recreation,
erosion control, aesthetics, and other associated forest resources values as well as cost-effective timber production.



 701.305 

The National FIP. 


The National FIP is jointly developed by ASCS, the FS and the committee of State foresters provided for in  701.303.



 701.306 

Development of State FIP. 


(a) A State FIP shall be developed in each applicable State or territory according to the provisions contained in this
part and in the National FIP. The State FIP shall be developed by the State forestry committee as provided in  701.303.

(b) The State FIP shall be: 
(1) Recommended by the STC and State forester; and 
(2) Approved by the Deputy Administrator after consulting with the FS.

 701.307 

Development of county FIP. 


(a) A county FIP shall be developed in each designated county according to the provisions of the State FIP. The county
FIP shall be developed by the CCRG. The CCRG, working with the governing body of the conservation district, the State
forestry agency representatives, the county supervisor of the Farmers Home Administration, and others with conservation
and environmental interest shall develop recommendations for the county program. 
(b) The county FIP shall be recommended by the COC and service forester and approved by the STC and State forester. 


 701.308 

Adaptation of practices. 


(a) The practices included in the State FIP shall satisfy the conditions and requirements of the National FIP. The
STC and State Forester may modify or delete National FIP provisions to make practices more restrictive where such
changes satisfy the objectives of the program. 
(b) The practices included in the county FIP must meet the conditions and requirements of the State FIP. The COC in consultation
with State Forestry representative or Service Forester may modify or delete State FIP provisions to make practices
more restrictive where such changes satisfy the objectives of the program. 


 701.309 

Levels and rates of cost-share assistance. 


(a) The maximum cost-share assistance for each practice shall be the percentage of the actual cost of performing the
practice considered necessary by ASCS to ensure completion of the practice by the participants. 
(b) Levels of cost-share assistance shall be approved by the STC and shall not be in excess of sixty-five (65) percent
of actual costs incurred by the landowners. 
(c) For the purpose of establishing rates of cost-share assistance, the average cost of performing a practice may
be the average cost for a State, a county or a part of a county, as determined by the STC. 
(d) The rates of cost-share assistance for practices included in the county FIP may be lower than the rates approved
for general use in the State, as determined by the COC. 


 701.310 

Prior approval for cost-share assistance. 


Costs will be shared only for those practices, or components of practices, for which cost-share assistance is requested
and approval issued before performance is started. 


 701.311 

Methods of approval. 


The COC shall determine the extent to which Federal funds may be made available to share the cost of each approved practice.
Approvals shall be made based on consideration of the county allocation, cost-effective opportunities for increasing
timber production, potential for enhancing other forest resources, the forestry needs in the county, and the practices
for which requested cost-share assistance is considered by the COC as most needed. The method approved shall provide
for the issuance of notices of approval showing for each approved practice the number of units of the practice for which
the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the cost share for the performance of that number of units
of the practice. Notices of approved requests shall be issued before the practice may be started. No practice may be
approved for cost-share assistance except as authorized by the county FIP. Available funds for cost-share assistance
shall not be allocated on a pro-rata basis, but shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most production attainable.

(a) Cost-share assistance may be approved under annual agreements or long-term agreements. 
(b) Land covered by a GPCP contract is not excluded from an annual or long-term agreement if the land is otherwise eligible.

(c) The same practices, cost-share levels, and general program provisions apply to both annual agreements and long-term
agreements.

 701.312 

Long-term agreements. 


(a) The period of a long-term agreement shall be for not less than three (3) years nor more than ten (10) years. The COC
and the parties to the agreement in consultation with the State forestry representative will mutually determine
the scheduling of essential practices and practice cost-sharing over the period of the agreement. 
(b) The long-term agreement shall be based on a forest management plan for the land which shall be developed by the service
forester. 
(c) The long-term agreement shall provide that the owner shall perform those measures in the forest management plan
which are determined to be essential regardless of whether cost-share assistance is approved for such measures.

(d) The level of cost-share assistance in effect for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level
in effect for the beginning year of the agreement. The rate of cost-sharing for payment purposes for such practices
will be based on the average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is performed. 
(e) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to fully comply with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting
with the service forester, the STC or COC determines that the seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action.
If the agreement is canceled, the signors to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for refunding all
cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case, no other refund
or forfeiture provisions of these regulations apply. 
(f) A long-term agreement may be revised in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator where
there is a change in status of the participants or the land under agreement. 
(g) An eligible person who acquires control of land under an approved agreement may elect to become a successor in interest
under such agreement. 
(h) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which loss of control has occurred and where the person
acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the agreement. If the loss of control
is for reasons beyond the control of the signatories to the agreement, the COC will determine whether or not any cost-share
assistance previously paid shall be refunded; however, in no event shall the refund be greater than would be required
in cases where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary on the part of the signatories, they
will be jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further
payments, with respect to the land for which control is lost. A refund will not be required for cost-share assistance
where the COC or the STC determines, after consulting with the service forester, that failure to perform the remaining
practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which have been performed and that the
completed practices will provide forestry benefits consistent with the cost-share assistance which have been paid.

(i) An agreement may be terminated if, after considering the recommendation of the service forester, the STC or COC
recommends that such action is in the public interest. 


 701.313 

Restoration of practices. 


(a) Cost-share assistance may be authorized under FIP for the establishment or installation of the practices contained
in this part. Cost-share assistance may not be authorized for repeating any of the practices in this part with the same
owner on the same acreage, except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. 
(b) Cost-share assistance may be authorized for the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of practices for which
such assistance has been allowed under the program only if all of the following conditions exist: 
(1) Replacement or restoration of the practice is needed to solve a conservation or environmental problem. 
(2) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of proper maintenance by the current operator. 
(3) The COC believes that the replacement or restoration of the practice merits consideration under the program to
an equal extent with other practices cost-shared. 
(c) Cost-share assistance may be authorized for timber stand improvement measures carried out in repetitive steps
where the stand treatment warrants such silvicultural practice in the judgment of the service forester. 


 701.314 

FIP maximum cost-share assistance limitations. 


For each program year, the total amount which may be received by any person under this subpart shall not exceed $10,000
with respect to eligible owners ( 701.302) in the United States or any commonwealth, territory, or possessions
of the United States for approved practices performed under annual or long-term agreements. 


 701.315 

Completion of practice. 


Cost-share assistance for the practices contained in this subpart is conditioned upon the performance of the practices
according to all applicable specifications and program provisions. 


 701.316 

Time of filing payment application. 


Cost-share assistance will be made only upon an application submitted to the county office by the prescribed time
limit or any authorized extension. Any application for payment may be rejected if any information required of the
applicant is not submitted to the county office within the 
applicable time limit.

Milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Marketing Areas; Revised
Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Orders 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed suspension of rules.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal that would suspend for nearly two years certain provisions of
the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Federal milk orders. If adopted,
the proposal would regulate a plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, under the Tennessee Valley order, instead of the Carolina
order, and it would keep regulated under the Tennessee Valley order a plant at Somerset, Kentucky, that otherwise
might become regulated under the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order. The proposals were submitted by Land-O-Sun
Dairies, which operates the Kingsport, Tennessee, plant, and Southern Bell Dairy, Inc., which operates the Somerset,
Kentucky, plant. These handlers contend that without the suspension they would be subject to pricing disparities
that could jeopardize their business.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 



Notice of Proposed Suspension (DA-93-29): Issued October 22, 1993; published October 28, 1993 (58 FR
57970). 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action
would lessen the regulatory burden on small entities by removing pricing disparities that are causing or could cause
financial hardship for certain distributing plants. 

The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not
intended to have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the
order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57970) on October 28, 1993, concerning the proposed suspension of certain provisions of the Georgia, Carolina,
and Tennessee Valley Federal milk orders (DA-93-29). The public was afforded the opportunity to comment
on the notice by submitting written data, views, and arguments by November 4, 1993. Six comment letters were received
concerning the three-market proposed suspension. 

Subsequent to the issuance of the above proposed suspension, a suspension request was received from a handler regulated
under the Tennessee Valley order that in effect expands the initial suspension issue to the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
order. It also affects a proposed suspension that was issued earlier for the Louisville order. Because of the interrelationship
of these several requests, it has been determined that a revised proposed suspension involving all four orders should
be issued for comment. Therefore, notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), the suspension of the following provisions of the orders
regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
marketing areas is being considered for a 23-month period beginning February 1, 1994: 

1. In  1005.7(d)(3) of the Carolina order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route disposition,
except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; 

2. In  1007.7(e)(3) of the Georgia order, the words ``, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section,'';


3. In  1007.7 of the Georgia order, paragraph (e)(4); 

4. In  1011.7(d)(3) of the Tennessee Valley order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route
disposition, except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; and 

5. In  1046.2 of the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order, the word ``Pulaski''.

All persons who desire to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington,
DC 20090-6456, by the 10th day after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 

The comment period is limited to 10 days so that the suspension, if found appropriate, can be implemented quickly and
thereby minimize financial hardship and disruptive marketing conditions. 

The comments that are sent will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business
hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). 



Statement of Consideration 



This proposed suspension would allow a distributing plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, that is located within the Tennessee
Valley marketing area and that meets all of the pooling standards of the Tennessee Valley order to be regulated under
that order rather than the Carolina order, as now, despite the plant having greater sales in the Carolina marketing
area. It would also allow a distributing plant located at Somerset, Kentucky, that has been regulated under the Tennessee
Valley order to remain regulated there even if it should develop greater sales in the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
(Order 46) marketing area. In addition, the proposed suspension would allow a supply plant at Springfield, Kentucky,
that has been supplying the Somerset plant to remain pooled under the Tennessee Valley order without having to make
uneconomic shipments of milk that it contends would be necessary if the Southern Belle plant shifted to Order 46. 



1. The problem of Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc. 

In recent months, the blend price to producers at Kingsport, Tennessee, under the Tennessee Valley order has been
significantly higher than the blend price at that location under the Carolina order. For example, during the months
of July through October 1993, the Tennessee Valley blend price at Kingsport was 32 cents, 29 cents, 20 cents, and 20
cents, respectively, higher than the Carolina blend price at Kingsport. Although the Class I price at Kingsport is
identical under both of these orders, the Tennessee Valley order's higher Class I utilization has resulted in a higher
blend price at Kingsport during nearly every month for the past two years. 

The difference in blend prices at Kingsport requires Land-O-Sun Dairies, as a Carolina order handler, to pay significant
over-order prices to retain its milk supply in competition with nearby handlers regulated under the Tennessee Valley
order. Land-O-Sun has indicated that it cannot continue to pay these over-order prices without jeopardizing the
existence of its business. It therefore proposed a suspension of certain provisions of Orders 5 and 11 that would allow
it to become regulated under Order 11. 

As noted in the earlier proposed suspension, the paragraph that is proposed to be suspended from the Georgia order
is merely a conforming change to preserve the status quo between the Carolina and Georgia orders. This change is necessary
to continue the regulation of a Greenville, South Carolina, plant under the Georgia order. Without the suspension,
the plant would become regulated under the Carolina order. 



2. The problem of Southern Belle Dairy Company. 

Southern Belle Dairy at Somerset, Kentucky, has been regulated under Order 11 for the past four years. However, recently
it has acquired accounts that could cause it to shift to Order 46. 

In recent months, the blend price at Somerset under Order 11 has been significantly higher than the blend price at that
location under Order 46. For example, during the months of July through October 1993, the blend price under Order 11
at Somerset was 67 cents, 62 cents, 49 cents, and 25 cents, respectively, higher than the Order 46 price at that location.
Of these amounts, 19 cents is attributable to a 19-cent higher Class I price at that location under Order 11. Southern
Belle contends that if it should shift to Order 46 it would have to pay substantial over-order prices to its producers
to retain its milk supply. Moreover, slight changes in sales could cause it to shift back and forth between the two orders,
causing market instability and uncertainty under the base-excess programs applicable to both orders. 



3. The problem of Armour Food Ingredients Company. 

Armour Food operates a supply plant and a nonpool manufacturing plant at Springfield, Kentucky. The supply plant
has been regulated under Order 11 since August 1992. If the Southern Belle plant shifts to Order 46, Armour's supply
plant would also become subject to the regulations of Order 46 because the plant is supplying milk to the Southern Belle
plant. Armour contends that the plant would not qualify as a pool plant based on its present milk handling practices
because, under the net shipment provision of Order 46, all of the shipments sent to its manufacturing facility from
pool distributing plants for surplus disposal would be subtracted from its shipments to pool distributing plants.
Armour states that to keep the milk of its producers pooled under Order 46 it would have to incur substantial increases
in transportation and assembly costs. To avoid these costs, Armour proposed suspending language in the net shipment
provision of Order 46. 



4. Industry responses to the earlier proposed suspensions (DA-93-29 and DA-93-26). 

On the basis of the Land-O-Sun request, a notice of proposed suspension of provisions in Orders 5, 7, and 11 was issued
on October 22, 1993 (DA-93-29)(58 FR 57970). Four comments were submitted in support of the action, and
two comments were filed in opposition to it. 

Milkco, Inc., a handler regulated under the Carolina order with a plant in Asheville, North Carolina, stated that
it supported the proposed suspension. Southern Belle Dairy also submitted a letter in support of the suspension.


A letter supporting the suspension also was received from Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., on behalf of Southern Milk
Sales, Inc., a dairy cooperative with producer milk pooled on the Tennessee Valley, Georgia, and Carolina orders.
The cooperative notes in its letter that ``paying higher over-order values to maintain its supply of milk would jeopardize
the existence of the affected distributing plant.''

Additionally, an individual dairy farmer who supplies producer milk to Land-O-Sun filed a comment in support of the
suspension. He stated that if Land-O-Sun paid him a lesser price for his milk he would have to sell to another handler.

Coburg Dairy, a Carolina order handler located in Charleston, South Carolina, filed a comment opposing the suspension.
Coburg competes with the Kingsport plant for Class I sales in the Carolina market. The handler argued that the regulation
of the Kingsport plant under the Tennessee Valley order would give the plant a competitive advantage in the Carolina
market since it has a lower Class I price and because it presumably would not have to pay over-order prices to its producers.

The North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, a general farm organization, also objected to the proposed suspension
on the grounds that regulation of the Kingsport plant under Order 11 would jeopardize the over-order prices in the
Carolina market. The Federation indicated that eroding Class I premiums and lower Class I utilization were threatening
the health of the dairy industry in North Carolina. 
In response to the Armour Food request, a notice of proposed suspension of the net shipment provision of Order 46 was
issued on September 22, 1993 (DA-93-26) (58 FR 50526). Three comments were submitted. 
Southern Belle supported the suspension, indicating that Armour was supplying it with milk and could encounter problems
of assembly and transportation if the plant became subject to the provisions of Order 46 because of a shift in regulation
of the Southern Belle plant from Order 11 to Order 46. 
Milk Marketing, Inc., a cooperative association with 688 dairy farmers under Order 46, and The Kroger Company, a handler
operating Winchester Farms Dairy at Winchester, Kentucky, filed comments opposing the proposed suspension of the
net shipment provision. MMI argued that if the net shipment provision is suspended, the intent of the order would not
be carried out appropriately and that the needs of the order would not be met in an efficient manner. Kroger stated that
there was not an abundant amount of milk available for fluid use under Order 46 and that the net shipment provision was
needed to help assure that distributing plants have sufficient supplies of milk to meet their fluid requirements.
It contends that there is no justification to relax the performance provisions of the order during the season when
milk availability is reduced and Class I sales increase simply because there is a ``possibility'' that a distributing
plant may switch regulation from Order 11 to Order 46. 
No final action has been taken on Armour's request to suspend the net shipment provision. However, since that issue
would become moot under the proposed suspension being considered herein, final action on the Armour proposal is being
held in abeyance pending the outcome of the current proposal.

Milk in the New Orleans-Mississippi Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of a Provision of the Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed suspension of rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend, for 23 months, the 45 percent delivery requirement
for a plant operated by a cooperative association that is located within the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area.
The suspension was requested by Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood,
Louisiana. The association states that without the suspension, it will be forced to make inefficient qualifying
shipments of milk merely to keep the milk of its producers qualified for pooling under the order. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such action would lessen the regulatory
impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their
milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 


The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This proposed action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, suspension
of the following provision of the order regulating the handling of milk in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing
area is being considered for the period from February 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995: 
In  1094.7(c), the words ``45 percent or more of the''. 
All persons wishing to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of their views to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 
20090-6456 by the 10th day after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The filing period is limited to ten days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete the required
procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective.

Statement of Consideration 



The proposed action would suspend for the months of February 1994 through December 1995 the 45 percent delivery requirement
for a cooperative association plant that is located in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area. 

Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana, that is regulated under
Order 94 submitted the suspension request. The cooperative stated that because of the present 45 percent delivery
requirement applicable to a cooperative association that wishes to qualify a manufacturing plant for pooling, it
has had to shift some of its producers to neighboring Greater Louisiana (Order 96) pool plants to keep its Kentwood
plant qualified as a pool plant under Order 94. It indicated that Order 96 requires that six days' production of a producer
must be received at pool plants each month in order to qualify the milk for pooling by diversion to a nonpool plant. Accordingly,
it has had to move the milk of selected producers to Order 96 pool plants six days per month. Since this milk is not actually
needed by these pool plants, the cooperative has then had to back-haul the milk to its Kentwood manufacturing plant
for processing. The problem is now particularly acute, according to the cooperative, because two Order 94 pool plants
have notified Gulf Dairy Association that they will no longer purchase milk from them after February 1, 1994. 

Gulf Dairy Association noted that the problem it is experiencing will be resolved through the proposed merger of milk
orders that is now under consideration by the Department. It urged that the proposed suspension be effective pending
the completion of that proceeding.

Adjustment to the Examinations Fee Schedule



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule proposes to adjust the current Examinations Fee schedule for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) in order to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs of providing immigration and naturalization services,
and to change procedures and charges for the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, Form I-129, in response to INS
and user experiences. The fee adjustment is needed to comply with specific Federal immigration laws and the Federal
user fee statute and regulations, which require the recipients of special benefits from Government services that
are not directed to the public at large to bear the costs to the Government of providing those services. The fees proposed
in this rule result from an analysis of adjudication and naturalization services and associated costs for fiscal
years 1993 and 1994, and are calculated to recover the costs of providing these special services and benefits. This
proposed rule ensures that funds will be available to continue to improve the quality of service to users. Its financial
impact on users of the services is small. In most cases the proposed fee increase is five dollars. In the aggregate this
proposed fee increase is slightly less than the projected change in the consumer price index since the last general
fee increase in April 1991.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 


The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is required by law to charge fees
to the users of its services. Such fees presently comprise about 36 percent of the INS budget. There are four fee accounts,
and the fees which are collected in each account are used to fund specific services. The four fee accounts are the Immigration
Examinations Fee Account, the Immigration User Fee Account, the Land Border Inspection Fee Account, and the Legalization
Fee Account. Because the fees in each of these accounts are designed to recover the costs which are incurred to provide
specific services, they must be reviewed regularly and adjusted as costs change or more precise cost determination
processes become available. This rule proposes to modify the examinations fee schedule. 
The Immigration Examinations Fee Account (Examinations Fee Account) provides funds for immigration adjudication
and naturalization services. It is funded by a total of 32 separate fees for processing the various applications used
by INS. Examples include applications for permanent resident status, petitions for relatives, employment authorization
applications, reentry permits, and extensions of temporary stay. The separate fees currently range from $30 to $140.

To cover the costs of providing adjudication and naturalization services, it has been determined that a fee increase
of 7.5 percent is needed. This increase reflects inflation since the last general fee increase in April 1991, the assignment
of certain additional costs to the Examinations Fee Account for services that support adjudications and naturalization
functions, and the costs of investments to improve services to users. This proposed rule would adjust the current
fee schedule by 7.5 percent. 


A. Refining the Fee Development Process 


INS has initiated a process of continuous improvement in the management of the finances of the fee accounts and the
development of fee schedules. Areas that are being addressed over a projected multi-year time horizon include: Identifying
the INS resources consumed in providing services to our customers which by law must be recovered through fee revenues;
refining definitions of direct and indirect costs; and refining cost measurement systems, in concert with wider
Department of Justice initiatives to improve financial management information systems. 
Of necessity, to ensure the availability of necessary funds for maintaining operations, the first phase of this effort
has been identification of INS resource use that must be recovered through fees. Prior to 1992, INS had not analyzed
rigorously the full extent of its costs related to fee-supported services. In 1992, INS undertook a comprehensive
review of the work that should properly be charged to fee accounts in order to meet statutory requirements. Extensive
information gathering and analysis were performed as part of this effort. The aggregate cost of the work in support
of the Examinations Fee Account was computed based on the budget for fiscal year 1993 and the estimated budget for fiscal
year 1994. 
This information was used to compute the percentage revenue increase required to cover the costs, and that percentage,
with limited exceptions, was applied to the existing fee schedule that has been in place since 1991 to arrive at the
proposed fees, through the steps explained in this proposed rule. 
Instead of using the existing fee schedule as a base for the percentage increases, INS also considered whether it would
have been feasible to base the proposed fees on 1992 cost measurements. INS rejected this approach because of problems
with 1992 data caused by the transition to a more automated system of productivity measurement. 
Future fee adjustments will reflect efforts to refine direct and indirect cost definitions and measurements, and
will address alternative approaches to the allocation of indirect costs among applicants for services. At this time,
however, the current fee schedule, with the adjustments specifically identified below, reflects the best available
comprehensive data on service costs, and was therefore judged to be the soundest foundation for computing the proposed
fee schedules for fiscal year 1994. 


II. Directives and Guidelines 


INS's examinations fees have been designed in accordance with legislation, guidance from the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) and the Department, and accepted principles of ratemaking in regulated public and commercial enterprises.
The overall principle employed is one of cost causation, which means the fees are designed to cover the costs associated
with providing the services funded through the Examinations Fee Account.

A. Legislation



The enabling legislation for the Examinations Fee Account is the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the
Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-459), a U.S.C. 1356(n), which provides
that the receipts collected shall ``* * * remain available * * * to reimburse any appropriation
the amount paid out of such appropriation for expenses in providing immigration adjudication and naturalization
services and the collection, safeguarding and accounting for fees * * *''. The Departments of Commerce,
Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Pub. L. 101-515), 8 U.S.C.
1356(m), provides further ``* * * that fees for providing adjudication and naturalization services
may be set at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing all such services, including the costs
of similar services provided without charge to asylum applicants or other immigrants. Such fees may also be set at
a level that will recover any additional costs associated with the administration of the fees collected.'' The general
authority to assess fees for services is found in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1952 (Pub. L. 82-137)
(IOAA), 31 U.S.C. 9701, frequently referred to as the ``user fee statute,'' which provides for Federal agencies to
define special services provided to unique segments of the population and to charge fees for those services instead
of supporting them through general tax revenues. The IOAA provides that ``* * * each service or thing
of value provided by an agency * * * to a person * * * is to be self-sustaining to the extent
possible.'' These charges, among other things, are to be based on ``* * * [t]he costs to the Government
* * *.''

In 1986, proposed fee increases for adjudication services were challenged in the Federal District Court for the District
of Columbia on the grounds that the Attorney General lacked authority to impose fees for the services in question and
that, even if the fees were legally permissible, the specific fees under challenge were arbitrarily excessive. In


Ayuda, Inc. 

v. 

Attorney General, 

661 F. Supp. 33 (D.D.C., 1987), the District Court rejected these arguments:





Accordingly, it appearing that the service fees were established through appropriate administrative procedures
after adequate cost analysis and with opportunity for public participation, and that they are in all respects consistent
with the statutes being implemented, summary judgment must be granted to the Attorney General and denied to plaintiffs.




661 F.Supp. at 36.



In upholding the District Court decision, the Court of Appeals held that:





In light of settled law, we are constrained to conclude that the INS fees at issue are for a ``service or thing of value''
which provides the recipients with a special benefit * * *. Since these procedures are triggered only
at the instance of the individual who seeks, obviously, to benefit from them, this fee regime cannot in fairness be
characterized as an INS effort to charge for activities that are carried on principally to benefit the public generally.
The benefit is simply too direct and immediate to a specific, identifiable beneficiary to consider such services
as constituting primarily a broad part of INS' overall mission to serve the public.







Ayuda, Inc. 

v. 

Attorney General, 

848 F.2d 1297, at 1301 (D.C. Cir. 1988).



B. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines



OMB circular A-25, User Charges, states that as a general policy ``a user charge * * * will be assessed
against each identifiable recipient for special benefits derived from Federal activities beyond those received
by the general public.'' The following discussion is provided:





When a service (or privilege) provides special benefits to an identifiable recipient beyond those that accrue to
the general public, a charge will be imposed (to recover the full cost to the Federal Government for providing the special
benefit, or the market price). For example, a special benefit will be considered to accrue and a user charge will be
imposed when a Government service:

(a) Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may not be measurable
in monetary terms) than those that accrue to the general public (e.g., receiving a patent, insurance, or guarantee
provision, or a license to carry on a specific activity or business or various kinds of public land use); or

(b) Provides business stability or contributes to public confidence in the business activity of the beneficiary
(e.g., insuring deposits in commercial banks); or

(c) Is performed at the request of or for the convenience of the recipient, and is beyond the services regularly received
by other members of the same industry or group or by the general public (e.g., receiving a passport, visa, airman's
certificate, or a Custom's inspection after regular duty hours).




Circular No. A-25, User Charges, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, July 8,
1993, pp. 2-3.



C. Department of Justice Guidelines



The Department of Justice issued guidance on User Fee Programs in April 1993. The guidance states that as a general
policy ``a charge shall be imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal Government of rendering a service that provides
specific benefits to an identifiable recipient above and beyond those that accrue to the public at large.'' The following
discussion is provided:





Cost is a financial measurement of resources used in accomplishing a specified purpose, carrying out an activity,
or completing a unit of work or a specific project * * *. Direct costs are those which are proximate and
directly traceable to the unit of output for which the fee is charged. Indirect costs are those which are more distant,
general in nature, and not directly traceable to the product or service produced.

* * * [E]xisting legislation may require the inclusion of costs for selected activities not directly
related to the unit of performance or product for which a fee is charged. Where this occurs, both the direct and indirect
costs of such activities should be included in the cost computation.





User Fee Programs, Department of Justice, Justice Management Division, April 1993, pp. 3 and 12. The policies and
procedures followed in the development of the proposed fee schedules are consistent with this guidance.

D. Ratemaking Principles


The above-stated policies, as set forth by statute and more fully developed by OMB and the Department, comport with
reasonable standards for user charges and are strongly supported by the prescriptions of economic experts with widely
recognized credentials in the field of ratemaking policy. Any other approach would burden taxpayers with costs that
can be traced directly to the needs of specific individuals, not to society at large.
One of many similar statements on cost of service as a basic standard of reasonableness is stated as follows in the authoritative
text by Bonbright, Danielsen, and Kamerschen:



No writer whose views on public utility rates command respect purports to find a single yardstick by sole reference
to which rates may be judged reasonable or socially desirable as distinguished from rates that are unreasonable or
adverse to the public interest. A complex of tests of acceptability is required just as would be the case with the tests
of a good automobile, a good income-tax law, or a good poem. Nevertheless, one standard of reasonable rates can fairly
be said to outrank all others in the importance attached to it by experts and public opinion alike_the standard of costs
of service, often qualified by the stipulation that the relevant cost is necessary, true (i.e., private and social)
cost or cost reasonably or prudently incurred.* * *
A cost standard of ratemaking has been most generally accepted in the regulation of the levels of rates charged by private
utility companies. But even more significant is the widespread adherence to cost, or to some approximation of cost,
as a basis of ratemaking under public ownership* * * *



Bonbright, Danielsen, and Kamerschen, Principles of Public Utility Rates, Public Utilities Reports, Inc., Arlington,
Va., 2nd ed. 1988, pp. 109-110.


While the foregoing reference is extracted from a discussion of public utility rates, the rate standard cited also
is applicable to other pricing situations that require cost recovery in a fair and reasonable manner.


III. Examinations Fee Account


This section describes the major programs funded by the Examinations Fee Account.


A. Adjudications and Naturalization Program


The function of this program is to process, adjudicate, and ultimately grant or deny applications and petitions for
benefits provided under the immigration laws of the United States. Adjudications activities include processing
applications for permanent resident status, petitions for relatives, temporary and permanent worker petitions,
reentry permits, refugee travel documents, extensions of temporary stay, employment authorizations, and temporary
protected status. Naturalization activities include the examination of aliens to determine their qualifications
for naturalization, administration of the oath for citizenship, and issuance of citizenship documents.


B. Refugees and Overseas Program


The function of this program is to adjudicate refugee and asylum applications, conduct investigations for preference
and relative visa petitions, and conduct other records checks and background investigations as are required at overseas
INS offices. Officers assigned to this program also provide assistance to citizens and lawful permanent residents
abroad regarding adoptions, immigration, or parole of alien spouses and children, and other benefits under the Immigration
and Nationality Act. They also review requests for the Attorney General to grant humanitarian parole into the United
States for deserving persons.

C. Information and Records Management


The Information and Records Management program provides a variety of services critical to the adjudications and
naturalization processes. These services include: Creating, updating, storing, retrieving, and tracking alien
files; responding to inquiries on application status; providing information to the public, both in-person and by
telephone, on immigration-related matters; printing and distributing application forms and instructions and
providing them to the public.


D. Data and Communications


The Data and Communications program develops and operates INS automated information systems which support the adjudications
and naturalization program, and operates the identification card production facility. Adjudications and naturalization
support systems are currently being integrated and consolidated into the Computer Linked Application Information
Management System (CLAIMS), which provides adjudication support to service centers, district offices, and ports
of entry. The system, which is operating in the service centers and is being installed in other field offices, reduces
application processing time and response time to inquiries.


IV. Fee Setting Procedures


This section provides a description of INS fee-setting procedures, including an explanation of the cost bases for
setting fees. Descriptions of the examinations fees and their cost components and an explanation of the procedures
employed by INS to calculate the costs are included.


A. History of Current Examinations Fees


Policies pertaining to the assessment of INS user fees and their underlying costs have evolved over 25 years, beginning
in 1968. The Examinations Fee Account itself has a more recent history, starting in 1989. Prior to 1989, all examinations
fee revenues were treated as general revenues of the Federal Government. They are now credited to the Examinations
Fee Account and used to fund related services.
Procedures to compute examinations fees involve the development and summation of three cost components: direct
costs, indirect costs, and a surcharge to recover the costs of the Refugees and Overseas program. These three cost
components are described more fully below.
Salient developments preceding the analyses that led to this proposed rule include the issuance in December 1992
of an audit report prepared by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Justice. That report,
entitled ``Controls Over Established User Fee Accounts in the Immigration and Naturalization Service'' (DOJ OIG
Audit Report No. 93-3), stated that INS's accounting system did not identify properly all costs that ought to
be recovered from user fee accounts. This view is summarized below:



The review of actual program costs disclosed that all identified costs were charged to the proper user fee accounts.
However, the INS accounting system does not provide usable cost data applicable to the user fee program and INS program
managers had not identified all the direct program costs that should have been reimbursed from the user fee accounts.
In addition, various INS units providing indirect support of personnel and services were not receiving user fee reimbursement
commensurate with the level of resources expended * * * Since valid direct and indirect program costs
went unidentified, appropriated funds essentially subsidized user fee related program costs that should have been
reimbursed from user fee revenue.




DOJ OIG Audit Report No. 93-3, at p. i.


The finding that all program costs were not being recovered from user fee accounts triggered several actions by INS
that culminated in the current proposed rule. At the same time that the OIG was conducting its audit, a senior Justice
Department official reviewed the fee-setting process and proposed changes. As a result, the OIG deferred additional
work in this area. According to the audit report:



A plan was developed and approved and the same Justice official was detailed to compile user fee costs, revise fee schedules
as necessary to collect revenues sufficient to make each account self-sustaining, and obtain Congressional approval
to reprogram INS appropriations accordingly. This project was initiated in March 1992 and is scheduled to be completed
by the end of FY 1992. Since the project covered most of the problem areas disclosed by our audit, we deferred additional
audit work in this area.



DOJ OIG Audit Report No. 93-3, at p. ii.


The review of the process conducted during 1992 consisted of a detailed survey and extensive consultations with all
INS program offices to review the extent to which they provide services to fee account activities, whether they were
commensurately reimbursed for those services, and whether specific service improvement investments would be appropriate
if additional fee account revenues were available.
An initial reallocation (reprogramming) of program costs proposed earlier by the Attorney General was approved
by Congress, with the effect of properly assigning some costs of user fee activities to the fee accounts. The budget
enacted by Congress for fiscal year 1993 reflected these reallocations.
The 1992 review found that the Attorney General's reprogramming had substantially corrected the assignment of costs
identifiable at that point as related to fee account activities, with two exceptions: The costs of legal proceedings
and the costs of management and administration. In the case of these two programs, some costs are being charged to fee
accounts, but not enough to cover the substantial work associated with the fee account activities.
The review also concluded that although a number of investments were recommended by review participants, the recommendations
generally anticipated actions that were planned in future budget cycles. Therefore the investments would generally
be addressed as part of INS's normal budget review process, rather than as a part of the current fee adjustment process.
This proposed fee increase incorporates the results of this extensive review of INS programs, inflationary cost
increases since the last general fee increase in April 1991, and the projected costs of presently budgeted program
investments to improve services to INS's customers.

B. Costs


1. Cost Components


OMB Circular A-25, in its discussion of cost determination for purposes of setting fees, provides that ``user
charges will be sufficient to recover the full cost to the Federal Government * * * of providing the
service * * *.'' It also provides that those costs shall include an ``appropriate share of the management
and supervisory costs.'' Circular No. A-25, User Charges, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management
and Budget, July 8, 1993, pp. 3-5. Direct costs are only the most readily identifiable costs of providing user
services. Each service also has indirect components which, although not as easily identifiable, are nevertheless
causally related to the costs of providing services. Each examinations fee has three components: direct costs, indirect
costs, and a surcharge to cover the costs of the Refugees and Overseas Program. 


a. Direct costs. 

Direct costs are those costs directly related to the processing of a particular application form for a particular
benefit. Direct costs include: the pay of the Adjudications officers and clerical staff working on each type of application
and the costs of their associated personnel benefits; the costs of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) name and
fingerprint checks; where applicable, the costs by application of naturalization ceremonies conducted by United
States Courts; and the costs of INS immigration document and card production. The pay costs are calculated by multiplying
average adjudications processing time by the hourly pay for the average grade levels of adjudicators and clerks.



b. Indirect costs. 

Indirect costs reflected in the current fee structure are defined as the costs of supervisory, management, and administrative
activities, related staff training, records, data processing, and files services, legal services, and space and
support costs of providing immigration benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act and related statutes.

Indirect costs also include costs in the management and administration portion of the INS budget, such as the costs
of the personnel administration work needed to recruit and pay the officers and clerks who process customers' applications
for benefits. The activities associated with these costs are no less essential to providing INS services to its customers
than are the direct costs. These indirect costs are distinguished only by the somewhat greater complexity of determining
the portion of such costs that are attributable to work done for fee-paying customers. In addition, indirect costs
include the cost of auditing the Examinations Fee Account by the Department of Justice Inspector General. 


c. Surcharge. 

The costs to carry out the Refugees and Overseas Program are borne by the Examinations Fee Account, at the direction
of Congress. See section 286(m) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1356(m). These costs are treated as a surcharge that is added to
the examinations fees. 


2. Cost Transfers


A transfer is the shift of costs from one account to another. Transfers arise when costs from one account are identified
as appropriately charged to another account. Transfers have been prompted by cost reviews such as that conducted
in 1992 to refine the identification of costs attributable to user fee activities. Transfers found in the 1992 review
to be necessary to meet statutory requirements are as follows: 


a. 

Legal proceedings. 

A review of INS workload statistics identified the equivalent of 78 additional positions and work years of legal activities
that properly should be charged to Examinations Fee Account activities. These legal activities include appearances
before the Immigration Court for hearings related to asylum, adjustment of status, registry, waivers of inadmissibility,
and rescission; the preparation of arguments and briefs for such hearings; appearances before Federal and state
courts for contested naturalization hearings; appearances in U.S. District Courts in mandamus and declaratory
judgment cases; preparation of arguments, briefs, and litigation reports in such cases; and associated legal consultations
and preparation of legal memoranda. Also included are resources for support staff, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney,
Regional Counsel, and District Counsel positions chargeable for Examinations work. INS will propose to transfer
these 78 positions, work years, and associated costs from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Examinations
Fee Account. Copies of this review are available upon request.

b. 

Management and administration. 

Management and Administration (M&A) resources have been assigned to the Examinations Fee Account using a ``distribution-key''
concept. Distribution-key is a term borrowed from the U.S. Postal Service's cost allocation practice. With this
practice, costs which cannot be directly related to a certain class or account are distributed on the basis of costs
which can be directly assigned. For example, in the case of mail processing, the costs associated with supervision
of mail clerks (where no direct statistical assignment mechanisms are in place) are distributed on the same basis
as are the costs for the mail clerks themselves (where statistical workload measurement systems are in place). See,
for example, Postal Rate Commission, Docket No. R90-1, United States Postal Service Library Reference F-1,
Summary Description of USPS Cost Development by Segments and Components, fiscal year 1988, pp. 2-2 through
2-5.

For this process, a full-time equivalent work year (referred to as ``work year'' or ``FTE'') was chosen as the distribution-key.
Costs were allocated based upon the percentage distribution of work years between the Examinations Fee Account and
all other accounts in INS. See Exhibit 1, Derivation of Management and Administration Distribution Key.

At INS, examinations officer work years relate directly to workload volume, and the management and administration
work that supports the examinations officers are dependent upon the number of officer work years. Work years are a
useful gauge of the resources needed in each program because they include the contributions of both full and part-time
staff. Other possible distribution-keys (positions and dollars) are believed to be inferior to work years. Positions
alone are inferior as a distribution-key because they include only full-time permanent staff and vacancies. The
use of positions would understate proper assignment levels to the extent that part-time workers are ignored, but
would overstate proper assignment levels to the extent that vacancies are included. Dollars are also an inferior
distribution-key because they may be skewed by the inclusion of one-time expenditures or other unique costs. 
 
The distribution-key concept is consistent with the guidance provided by the Department. The following discussion
is provided: 
 


 
 

For each overhead activity * * *, estimate, on a rational basis, approximately what percentage of
the amount is indirectly relatable or incidental to the functions and costs * * * . The percentage assigned
ordinarily should be based on the relative amount of time or outputs traceable to the particular unit of performance.
In the case of very general, non-traceable activities (e.g., executive direction or congressional and public affairs),
where there are labor-intensive performance units, general or non-traceable cost allocations may be predicated
on relative employment (costs or full time personnel equivalents) devoted directly to the fee account revenue-generating
programs vis-a-vis all other programs. 
 


 
 

User Fee Programs, Department of Justice, Justice Management Division, April 1993, pp. 10-11. 
 


To distribute costs properly, based on the distribution-key concept, INS will propose to transfer 143 positions,
133 work years, and associated costs from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation to the Examinations Fee Account.
However, INS will not propose to use all of the resources potentially available as a result of the transfer to correct
documented deficiencies in M&A program support activities in fiscal year 1994. Rather, INS will propose to use
part of these resources to support additional work years for the Adjudications and Naturalization Program to ensure
good service during the period of transition when more work will be shifted from district offices to service centers
(the ``Direct Mail III'' program). INS will defer full use of the resources for program support activities until fiscal
year 1995 or 1996, as conditions warrant. 
 


3. Investments to Improve Service Quality 
 


Service quality improvements are made possible by investments in staff additions and capital assets. One investment
which will be financed by the examinations fee increase will be the continued expansion of INS service center operations.
These expanded automation-intensive facilities will improve productivity and reduce delays in application processing
operations. The transfer of work now conducted at the district offices to the service centers will improve processing
at district offices and allow district office staff to devote more time to those applications which require personal
contact with people applying for benefits. 
 


C. Proposed Fee Increase 
 


The need for increased revenues which underlies the proposed fee increase was calculated by adjusting the projected
total costs of providing adjudications and naturalization services to include the transfers and service improvements
described above, and comparing the costs to the revenue projected under the current fee schedule. Because they are
reflected in INS budget projections, the calculation incorporates the effects of inflation-based cost increases
that have occurred since the last general fee increase in April 1991 and all other mandatory adjustments to the cost
base. This calculation yields a required percentage revenue increase which, with limited exceptions, was then uniformly
applied to the existing schedule of fees. The exceptions to this procedure, required because of (i) the consolidation
of forms and (ii) certain technical adjustments, are described below. 
 
Exhibit 2, Projected Examinations Fee Account, shows the projected fiscal year 1994 resource allocations to the
Examinations Fee Account. The projected transfers from the Salaries and Expenses appropriation, which are incorporated
in Exhibit 2, are shown in Exhibit 3, Projected Transfers From Salaries and Expenses Appropriation to Examinations
Fee Account. 
 
Exhibit 4, Proposed Examinations Fee Revenue Adjustment, shows how the proposed fee increase was computed. The calculations
are based on the projected fiscal year 1994 budget, and begin with an estimate of the funds that will remain in the Examinations
Fee Account at the close of fiscal year 1993.

INS projects that $18.7 million will be carried forward in the Examinations Fee Account from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal
year 1994 (Line 1). Revenue of $314.7 million is anticipated in fiscal year 1994 at the fee levels currently in place
(Line 2). The sum of these two amounts is $333.4 million, which is the total amount projected to be available for the
Examinations Fee Account for fiscal year 1994 in the absence of a fee increase (Line 3). 

INS projects that the costs of Examinations Fee Account programs for fiscal year 1994 will be $331.5 million (Line
4). Because of the impossibility of predicting precisely the number of applications and associated revenue and workload
in any given time period, and in order to ensure that there are sufficient resources to adjudicate applications, including
those currently in process, INS has determined the need to retain a balance equivalent to one month of costs, or $27.6
million (Line 5). The remainder of that amount, if any, would be carried forward to the next fiscal year to continue
processing applications. The existence of a carryforward balance is consistent with INS' past practice. As explained
below, technical adjustments were applied to the fee base for some forms to ensure fair distribution of costs among
users. The net effect of those adjustments is subtracted so that they will have no net impact on the aggregate INS fee
revenue requirement (Line 6). The algebraic sum of these three amounts is the total revenue requirement of $356.9
million (Line 7). 

Subtracting the revenue requirement from the funds available shows a revenue shortfall of $23.5 million (Line 8).
Dividing this shortfall by the revenues projected under the current fee schedule produces the percentage by which
the fees must be increased, 7.5 percent (Line 9). 



D. Computation of the Fees 



The proposed fees for most Immigration and Naturalization forms were calculated by applying the increase of 7.5 percent
to the current fee, and rounding the result upward or downward to the nearest $5.00. Fees adjusted in this manner are
shown on Exhibit 5. 

There were two exceptions to this computational procedure. One exception is a consequence of forms consolidation
actions affecting the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, 
I-129, where procedures and charges have been altered in response to experience with the consolidated forms
and suggestions from users. The new charges associated with the I-129 are described below, and presented in
Exhibit 6. The other exception is associated with technical adjustments to the computational base for certain forms,
as described below and shown in Exhibit 7. 



1. Petition For a Nonimmigrant Worker, I-129 



On October 4, 1991, INS published a proposed revision of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (56 FR
50350). This revision consolidated a number of separate application and petition processes that had previously
been handled on separate application forms, each with separate fees. To the extent possible, the new form retained
the original fee structure, which was based upon the costs associated with each separate adjudication. 

After the consolidation of Form I-129, INS received a number of comments and questions regarding the I-129
process. As a result, INS proposes to revise Form I-129 to incorporate several additional processes created
by the Immigration Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-649) and the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization
Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-232), and to simplify the application procedures in response to public comments.
For example, INS proposes to revise procedures in instances where an employer is filing for one worker to allow the
worker's dependents to be included in the petition instead of requiring separate applications. In addition, INS
would no longer require separate petitions for groups where the members will be applying for visas at more than one
consulate or for visa-exempt workers applying for admission at different ports of entry. 

Current Form I-129 Fee Structure: 

The fee for a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker consists of a base fee of $70 plus either: 

 


_$10 per worker if requesting consulate or port-of-entry notification for visa issuance or admission; 

_$80 per worker if requesting a change of status; or 

_$50 per worker if requesting an extension of stay. 

 


Proposed Form I-129 Fee Structure: 

The proposed fee for a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker is $120 per petition plus $10 for each dependent if filing
for one worker, and $100 per petition plus $20 for each worker if filing for more than one worker. The changes simplify
the application process and more fairly distribute the costs of processing. 

Because INS has consolidated actions which were previously separate, data are not yet available for establishing
a fee based upon actual cost experience. Therefore, the proposed fee is based upon estimates of these costs. 



2. Technical Adjustments to Computation Base for Certain Applications 



Before undertaking the percentage computations to arrive at the fee schedules proposed in this rule, INS reviewed
the cost information supporting the current fee schedule. The information on processing times and related costs,
the costs of FBI name and fingerprint checks, the costs of naturalization ceremonies conducted by United States Courts,
the costs of INS immigration document and card production, the indirect costs and the surcharge were examined. (Copies
of this analysis are available upon request.) Some differences were found between the current fees and the statistical
information on the associated costs. The differences are small, and probably result from data corrections after
the fees were computed. 

In order to ensure fair distribution of costs among users, INS adjusted, upward or downward as necessary, the current
fees for forms where differences were identified, before computing the proposed fee increase for those forms. INS
ensured that this process had no net effect on the total revenue increase proposal by deducting the revenue increase
that would be caused by the technical adjustments from the total revenue requirement before calculating the percentage
fee revenue adjustment that would be applied to all forms. As previously noted, this deduction appears on Line 6 of
Exhibit 4, where the fee revision requirement is calculated. 



V. Proposed Fee Adjustments 



Proposed fee adjustments are shown in Exhibits 5-7. 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the
meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612. 

The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been cleared by the Office of Management and
Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Clearance numbers for these collections are contained
in 8 CFR 299.5, Display of Control Numbers.

Conditional Permanent Resident Regulations for Alien Entrepreneurs, Spouses, and Children



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule implements provisions of section 121 of the Immigration Act of 1990, by providing for conditional resident
status to certain alien entrepreneurs, their spouses, and their unmarried minor children. It also provides for the
removal of the conditional basis of such status through the filing of a petition by the alien entrepreneur. This rule
will allow alien entrepreneurs to continue their commercial enterprises while providing jobs in the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (the Service) notes that the legislative history on conditional permanent
residence status for alien entrepreneurs is limited in its guidance; therefore, this rule relies heavily on the language
of the statute itself. Congress, however, did indicate that the two-year conditional status for alien entrepreneurs
exists for the primary purpose of ensuring that ``all aliens receiving visas in this section * * * continue
their new commercial enterprises so that the creation of U.S. jobs and the infusion of capital into the U.S. economy
is sustained.'' S. Rep. No. 101-55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1989).



Accordingly the Service proposes to amend 8 CFR parts 211, 216, 235, and 242 by providing conditional permanent resident
status for certain alien entrepreneurs, their spouses, and their children.

Petition for Removal of Conditions



The Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-649,
November 29, 1990, requires that an alien entrepreneur file a petition for removal of conditions during the 90-day
period before the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident status (section 216A(d)(2)(A)
of the Act). The petition should include any spouse or children accorded conditional permanent resident status.
Children who have reached the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence
will remain eligible for removal of conditions. The statute also calls for a personal interview of the alien within
90 days after the date the alien files the petition for removal of conditions. The Service may waive the requirement
of an interview in appropriate cases (section 216A(d)(3) of the Act).

This rule provides that the required petition shall be filed with the Service Center having jurisdiction over the
location of the alien's commercial enterprise. The petition will be reviewed by the Service Center, and a determination
will be made on the necessity of an interview. If the Service Center director determines in his or her discretion that
a decision may be made on the basis of the petition and accompanying evidence without the necessity of an interview,
the decision on the petition will be rendered at the Service Center. If the director determines that an interview is
needed, the Service Center director will schedule the alien for an interview to be held at the local Service district
office or sub-office having jurisdiction over the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.
The local district office will then take responsibility for the case to its conclusion. 



Decision on Petition



If the alien's petition is approved, the conditional basis of the beneficiaries' permanent resident status will
be removed as of the second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent resident. Denial of a petition
will result in termination of the alien's lawful permanent resident status and issuance by the Service of an order
to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United States. There is no appeal from this denial, but the
alien may seek review of the decision by the immigration judge in deportation proceedings. In such deportation proceedings,
the burden shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information
in the alien's petition for removal of conditions are not true.

The Service explored the possibility of establishing by regulation some form of hardship waiver similar to that set
forth at 8 CFR 216.5 for removal of conditions for certain alien spouses and sons and daughters. The Service has concluded
that such a waiver cannot, consistent with the statute, be created by regulation for alien entrepreneurs. Section
216A(c)(3)(C) of the Act sets out a mandatory instruction: The Attorney General shall terminate the permanent resident
status of an alien entrepreneur who has failed to comply with the requirements for removal of conditions. Unlike section
216, section 216A of the Act does not provide for the waiver of these requirements in cases of hardship. 

Although the statute does not provide for a waiver of requirements for removal of conditions for alien entrepreneurs,
the requirement that an alien entrepreneur has sustained his or her investment of the requisite capital during the
two years of conditional residence will be interpreted flexibly. The alien entrepreneur will be considered to have
``sustained'' the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the
capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the
two years of conditional residence. This liberal interpretation of the term ``sustained'' in section 216A(a)(1)(C)
of the Act permits the Service maximum flexibility in determining whether the prerequisites for removal of the conditions
have been met in light of the congressional intent underlying this provision. The Service recognizes that a bona-fide
and good faith investment may not meet all of the expectations envisioned when the alien entrepreneur obtained conditional
residence status. For example, the fact that an alien entrepreneur has less than the requisite capital invested in
the enterprise at the end of the two-year conditional period would not necessarily require the denial of the petition
to remove conditions. The petition could be granted if the alien entrepreneur had invested a substantial portion
of the requisite capital, thereby demonstrating that he or she was actively sustaining his or her investment in the
enterprise as required by the statute. The determination of whether an alien entrepreneur had invested a substantial
portion of the requisite capital in good faith will be made on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule reflects this
standard at 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii) and 8 CFR 216.6(c)(1)(iii). 

The following example illustrates how the alien entrepreneur can ``substantially meet'' the capital investment
requirement. An alien entrepreneur is granted conditional residence based on a business plan which envisioned an
investment of $1.2 million. At the end of the conditional residence period, he or she has invested only $800,000 in
a non-targeted employment area, because through circumstances beyond the alien's control, construction of a facility
took longer than anticipated. The Service may remove the conditions, if the entrepreneur can show that he or she can
and will invest the additional capital within a reasonable time to complete the investment. On the other hand, if the
entrepreneur cannot show that he or she will be able to generate additional capital within a reasonable time, regardless
of his or her good-faith efforts, the Service will not remove the conditions.

<TEXT>
 

In determining whether an alien entrepreneur has demonstrated that he or she invested in good faith, the Service will
examine his or her intent based on both objective and subjective standards. The following example illustrates the
``good faith'' analysis. An entrepreneur invests $600,000 in a non-targeted employment area prior to obtaining
conditional residence, but is unable to provide the additional capital as envisioned in the Form I-526 application.
At the time he or she obtained conditional residence, he or she had no realistic prospect of obtaining funds to meet
the capital investment requirement and in fact is unable to acquire the additional $400,000 required to complete
the investment. Even though the entrepreneur sincerely wished to make the investment succeed, under the objective
part of the good faith analysis, the entrepreneur will be unable to establish that he or she substantially met the capital
investment requirement in good faith.
This rule also permits the director for good cause to remove conditions for the spouse and/or unmarried minor children
of a deceased principal alien entrepreneur. If the spouse and/or children can show that, despite the entrepreneur's
death, the requirements for removal of conditions have been met, the director may approve the petition and remove
the conditions. This procedure makes humanitarian as well as economic sense and fufills the goals of the statute in
that the economy of the United States will have benefited in the manner sought by Congress notwithstanding the death
of the principal entrepreneur.


Other Reasons for Termination


The statute calls for termination of the alien's conditional permanent residence status during the two-year period
if the Service determines: That establishment of the new commercial enterprise was for the sole purpose of evading
United States immigration laws; that the new commercial enterprise in fact was not established; that the alien did
not invest or was not in the process of investing the prescribed capital; that the alien was not sustaining the new commercial
enterprise or the investment of capital; or that the alien was not otherwise conforming to the requirements of the
status (section 216A(b)(1) of the Act). If the Service determines any of the foregoing, the alien's status will be
terminated and an order to show cause will be issued. The alien may request review of this decision in deportation proceedings.
In such proceedings, the burden of proof will rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence
that one of the foregoing reasons for termination is true.
Termination will also result, and an order to show cause will be issued, if the alien enterpreneur fails to file the
required petition for removal of conditions or, without good cause, fails to appear for a personal interview when
requested by the Service (section 216A(c)(2) of the Act). The decision may be reviewed in deportation proceedings,
but, in either instance, the burden will rest with the alien to show compliance with the filing and interview requirments.
The Service may accept and consider a late petition if the alien demonstrates good cause and extenuating circumstances
for having failed to file a timely petition. Furthermore, the Service may stay deportation proceedings and consider
a petition for an alien who is the subject of deportation proceedings for failure to file a timely petition if the alien
demonstrates good cause and extenuating circumstances.
Finally, the legislative history of this provision at S. Rep. No. 101-55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1989) indicates
Congress's wish that ``* * * processing of an individual visa not continue if it becomes known to the
Government that the money invested was obtained by the alien through other than legal means (such as money received
through the sale of illegal drugs).'' This position is clearly part of Congress's general policy to penalize one who
prospers as a result of an illegal enterprise. That policy is evidenced elsewhere in the federal law, such as the statute
which defines money laundering crimes as aggravated felonies, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43), and the provisions of the United
States Code which provide for the forfeiture of proceeds of unlawful activities to the United States, 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(6)
(forfeiture of proceeds of controlled substance exchange) and 18 U.S.C. 1963(a)(3) (forfeiture of proceeds of racketeering
activity or unlawful debt collection). In light of Congress's specific statement of intent with regard to this provision,
and its overall policy concerning proceeds from illegal activities, termination of status will result at any time
during the two-year conditional residence period or at the time a petition for removal of conditions is filed, if the
Service determines that the alien's investment funds have been obtained through other than legal means.


Application Fee


In accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, 

User Charges,

 ``user charges will be sufficient to recover the full cost to the Federal Government * * * of providing
the service * * *. Full cost shall be determined or estimated from the best available records of the
agency * * *.'' The Service proposes to institute an application fee of $90.00 for filing form I-829.
This fee is based on the estimated costs of processing the petition.
The I-829 fee will be one of many examinations fees assessed for providing adjudication and naturalization
services. Each examinations fee has three components: Direct costs, indirect costs, and a surcharge to cover the
costs of the International Affairs and Outreach Program (formerly the Refugees and Overseas Program).
Direct costs are those costs directly related to the processing of a particular application form for a particular
benefit. Generally, direct costs include: The pay of the adjudications officers and clerical staff working on each
type of application and the costs of their associated personnel benefits; the costs of Federal Bureau of Investigation
name and fingerprint checks; where applicable, the costs by application of naturalization ceremonies conducted
by the United States Courts; and the costs of INS immigration document and card production. The pay costs are calculated
by multiplying average adjudications processing time by the hourly pay for the average grade level of adjudicators
and clerks. For the I-829, the direct costs include the pay costs of the adjudications officers and clerical
staff and the costs of producing the Alien Registration Card.
Indirect costs are defined as the costs of supervisory, management, and administrative activities, related staff
training, records, data processing, files services, legal services, and space and support costs of providing immigration
benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act and related statutes. Indirect costs also include costs in the
management and administration portion of the INS budget, such as the costs of personnel administration work needed
to recruit and pay the officers and clerks who process customers' applications for benefits. The activities associated
with these costs are no less essential to providing INS services to its customers than are the direct costs. These indirect
costs are distinguished only by the somewhat greater complexity of determining the portion of such costs that are
attributable to work done for fee-paying customers.
The costs to carry out the International Affairs and Outreach Program are borne by the Examinations Fee Account, at
the direction of Congress. See section 286(m) of the Act. These costs are treated as a surcharge that is added to the
examinations fees.
The total cost of processing the I-829 is estimated at $90.45. The proposed fee was determined by rounding the
total cost to the nearest $5.00. As the Service gains experience in processing this new application, the fee will be
adjusted as necessary based on improved data.

Technical Changes



The proposed regulation also contains some minor technical changes resulting from the merger of Form I-751
and Form I-752 into the new Form I-751 (see 56 FR 55931 on October 30, 1991; 57 FR 6181 on February 21, 1992).
This regulation eliminates reference to the Form I-752, which has been cancelled.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Insofar as this proposed rule merely sets forth the procedures for terminating the conditional resident status of
alien entrepreneurs already present in the country and for removing the conditional basis of permanent resident
status for such persons, any impact the proposed rule will have on small business entities will be, at most, indirect
or attenuated. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have
Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.

This rule contains information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control numbers for these collections are
contained in 8 CFR 299.5. This rule also contains a new collection requirement which has been forwarded to OMB under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act for review and clearance.

 216.3



Termination of conditional resident status.



(a) 

During the two-year conditional period. 

The director shall send a formal written notice to the conditional permanent resident of the termination of the alien's
conditional permanent resident status if the director determines that any of the conditions set forth in section
216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, or it becomes known to the government that an
alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her investment capital
through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). If the Service issues a notice of Intent
to Terminate an alien's conditional resident status, the director shall not adjudicate Form I-751 or Form I-829
until it has been determined that the alien's status shall not be terminated. During this time, the alien shall continue
to be a lawful conditional permanent resident with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided to
persons possessing such status. Prior to issuing the Notice of Termination, the director shall provide the alien
with an opportunity to review and rebut the evidence upon which the decision is to be based, in accordance with  103.2(b)(2)
of this chapter. The termination of status, and all of the rights and privileges concomitant thereto (including authorization
to accept or continue in employment in this country), shall take effect as of the date of such determination by the director,
although the alien may request a review of such determination in deportation proceedings. In addition to the notice
of termination, the director shall issue an order to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United
States, in accordance with part 242 of this chapter. During the ensuing deportation proceedings, the alien may submit
evidence to rebut the determination of the director. The burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions in section 216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable,
are true, or that an alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her
investment capital through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs).

(b) 

Determination of fraud after two years. 

If, subsequent to the removal of the conditional basis of an alien's permanent resident status, the director determines
that an alien spouse obtained permanent resident status through a marriage which was entered into for the purpose
of evading the immigration laws or an alien entrepreneur obtained permanent resident status through a commercial
enterprise which was improper under section 216A(b)(1) of the Act, the director may institute rescission proceedings
pursuant to section 246 of the Act (if otherwise appropriate) or deportation proceedings under section 242 of the
Act.

15. In  216.4, paragraph (a)(6) is amended in the first sentence by removing the phrase ``or Form I-752''.

General. 

A conditional resident alien who is unable to meet the requirements under section 216 of the Act for a joint petition
for removal of the conditional basis of his or her permanent resident status may file a Petition to Remove the Conditions

 216.6



Petition by entrepreneur to remove conditional basis of lawful permanent resident status.



(a) 

Filing the petition

_(1) 

General procedures. 

A petition to remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status of an alien accorded conditional permanent
residence pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act must be filed by the alien entrepreneur on Form I-829, Petition
by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. The alien entrepreneur must file Form I-829 within the 90-day period
preceding the second anniversary of his or her admission to the United States as a conditional permanent resident.
Before Form I-829 may be considered as properly filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under  103.7(b)(1)
of this chapter, and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and it must be properly signed
by the alien. Upon receipt of a properly filed Form I-829, the alien's conditional permanent resident status
shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as the director has adjudicated the petition. The
entrepreneur's spouse and children should be included in the petition to remove conditions. Children who have reached
the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence may be included in the
petition.

(2) 

Jurisdiction. 

Form I-829 must be filed with the regional service center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien
entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.

<TEXT>
 

(3) 

Physical presence at time of filing. 

A petition may be filed regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United States. However, if the
alien is outside the United States at the time of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her spouse
and children, if necessary, to comply with the interview requirements contained in the Act. Once the petition has
been properly filed, the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in possession of documentation as
set forth in  211.1(b)(1) of this chapter, provided the alien complies with the interview requirements described
in paragraph (b) of this section. An alien who is not physically present in the United States during the filing period
but subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be processed in accordance with  235.11 of
this chapter. 

(4) 

Documentation.

 The petition for removal of conditions must be accompanied by the following evidence: 

(i) Evidence that a commercial enterprise was established by the alien. Such evidence may include, but is not limited
to, Federal income tax returns; 

(ii) Evidence that the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. Such evidence
may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement; and 

(iii) Evidence that the alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section
throughout the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained
the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment
requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional
residence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bank statements, invoices, receipts, contracts, business
licenses, Federal or State income tax returns, and Federal or State quarterly tax statements. 

(iv) Evidence that the alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable time ten full-time jobs for qualifying
employees. In the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien entrepreneur must
submit evidence that the commercial enterprise maintained the number of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment
level for the period following his or her admission as a conditional permanent resident. Such evidence may include
payroll records, relevant tax documents and Forms I-9. 

(5) 

Termination of status for failure to file petition.

 Failure to properly file Form I-829 within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary
of the date on which the alien obtained lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic
termination of the alien's permanent residence status and the initiation of deportation proceedings. The director
shall send a written notice of termination and an order to show cause to an alien entrepreneur who fails to timely file
a petition for removal of conditions. No appeal shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may request a review
of the determination during deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden of proof shall rest
with the alien to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the requirement to file the petition
within the designated period. The director may deem the petition to have been filed prior to the second anniversary
of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent residence status and accept and consider a late petition if the alien
demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that failure to file a timely petition was for good cause and due to extenuating
circumstances. If the late petition is filed prior to jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in deportation
proceedings and the director excuses the late filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's
permanent resident status, remove the conditional basis of such status, and cancel any outstanding order to show
cause in accordance with  242.7 of this chapter. If the petition is not filed until after jurisdiction vests
with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.


(6) 

Death of entrepreneur and effect on spouse and children. 

If an entrepreneur dies during the prescribed two-year period of conditional permanent residence, the spouse and
children of the entrepreneur will be eligible for removal of conditions if it can be demonstrated that the conditions
set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section have been met.

(b) 

Petition review

_(1) 

Authority to waive interview. 

The director of the service center shall review the Form I-829 and the supporting documents to determine whether
to waive the interview required by the Act. If satisfied that the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this
section have been met, the service center director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so satisfied,
then the service center director shall forward the petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the
location of the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States so that an interview of the alien
entrepreneur may be conducted. The director must either waive the requirement for an interview and adjudicate the
petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was properly filed. 
 
(2) 

Location of interview. 

Unless waived, an interview relating to the Form I-829 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other
officer so designated by the district director at the district office that has jurisdiction over the location of the
alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States. 
 
(3) 

Termination of status for failure to appear for interview. 

If the alien fails to appear for an interview in connection with the petition when requested by the Service, the alien's
permanent resident status will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of the date on which the alien
obtained permanent residence. The alien will be provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons
therefore, and an order to show cause shall be issued placing the alien under deportation proceedings. The alien may
seek review of the decision to terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall be on the alien to
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the interview requirements. If the alien
has failed to appear for a scheduled interview, he or she may submit a written request to the district director asking
that the interview be rescheduled or that the interview be waived. That request should explain his or her failure to
appear for the scheduled interview, and if a request for waiver of the interview, the reasons such waiver should be
granted. If the district director determines that there is good cause for granting the request, the interview may
be rescheduled or waived, as appropriate. If the district director waives the interview, he or she shall restore the
alien's conditional permanent resident status, cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with  242.7
of this chapter, and proceed to adjudicate the alien's petition. If the district director reschedules that alien's
interview, he or she shall restore the alien's conditional residence status, and cancel any outstanding order to
show cause in accordance with  242.7 of this chapter. If the interview is rescheduled at the request of the alien,
the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview within the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.

 
(c) 

Adjudication of petition. 

(1) The decision on the petition shall be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the date of interview,
whichever is later. In adjudicating the petition, the director shall determine whether: 
 
(i) A commercial enterprise was established by the alien; 
 
(ii) The alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital; and 
 
(iii) The alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section throughout
the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained the actions
required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement
of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence.

 
(iv) The alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable period of time ten full-time jobs to qualifying
employees. In the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien maintained the number
of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment level for the previous two years. 
 
(2) If derogatory information is determined regarding any of these issues or it becomes known to the government that
the entrepreneur obtained his or her investment funds through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal
drugs), the director shall offer the alien entrepreneur the opportunity to rebut such information. If the alien entrepreneur
fails to overcome such derogatory information or evidence the investment funds were obtained through other than
legal means, the director may deny the petition, terminate the alien's permanent residence, and issue an order to
show cause. If derogatory information not relating to any of these issues is determined during the course of the interview,
such information shall be forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no unresolved derogatory
information is determined relating to these issues, the petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the
alien's permanent residence status removed, regardless of any action taken or contemplated regarding other possible
grounds for deportation. 
 
(d) 

Decision

_(1) 

Approval. 

If, after initial review or after the interview, the director approves the petition, he or she will remove the conditional
basis of the alien's permanent resident status as of the second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent
resident. He or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the alien and shall require the alien to report to
the appropriate district office for processing for a new Alien Registration Receipt Card, Form I-551, at which
time the alien shall surrender any Alien Registration Receipt Card previously issued.
 
(2) 

Denial. 

If, after initial review or after the interview, the director denies the petition, he or she shall provide written
notice to the alien of the decision and the reasons(s) therefor, and shall issue an order to show cause why the alien
should not be deported from the United States. The alien's lawful permanent resident status and that of his or her spouse
and any children shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written decision. The alien shall also be instructed
to surrender any Alien Registration Receipt Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from this decision;
however, the alien may seek review of the decision in deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden
shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information in the alien's
petition for removal of conditions are not true and that the petition was properly denied.

Authority: 

8 U.S.C. 1101, 1103, 1182, 1183, 1201, 1224, 1225, 1226, 1227, 1228, 1252. 




20. In  235.11, paragraphs (a) and (c) are revised to read as follows: 



 235.11 

Admission of conditional permanent residents. 



(a) 

General_

(1) 

Conditional residence based on family relationship. 

An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as the spouse or son or daughter of a United States
citizen or lawful permanent resident shall be examined to determine whether the conditions of section 216 of the Act
apply. If so, the alien shall be admitted conditionally for a period of two years. At the time of admission, the alien
shall be notified that the alien and his or her petitioning spouse must file a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence
(Form I-751) within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission
for permanent residence. 

(2) 

Conditional residence based on entrepreneurship. 

An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section
216A(f)(1) of the Act) or the spouse or unmarried minor child of an alien entrepreneur shall be admitted conditionally
for a period of two years. At the time of admission, the alien shall be notified that the principal alien (entrepreneur)
must file a Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I-829) within the 90-day period immediately
preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence. 



* * * * * 



(c) 

Expired conditional permanent resident alien status. 

The lawful permanent resident alien status of a conditional resident automatically terminates if the conditional
basis of such status is not removed by the Service through approval of a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence
(Form I-751) or, in the case of an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), a Petition
by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I-829). Therefore, an alien who is seeking admission as a returning
resident subsequent to the second anniversary of the date on which conditional residence was obtained (except as
provided in  211.1(b)(1) of this chapter) and whose conditional basis of such residence has not been removed
pursuant to section 216(c) or 216A(c) of the Act, whichever is applicable, shall be placed under exclusion proceedings.
However, in a case where conditional residence was based on a marriage, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and
the alien may be admitted as a returning resident if the required petition (Form 
I-751) is filed jointly, or by the alien alone (if appropriate), and approved by the Service. In the case of an
alien entrepreneur, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and the alien admitted as a returning resident if the
required petition (Form I-829) is filed by the alien entrepreneur and approved by the Service.

adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, or under section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966, or under section
101 or 104 of the Act of October 28, 1977; or for the creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence
under section 249 of the Act. The application shall be subject to the requirements of parts 244, 245, and 249 of this
chapter. The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse
(as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act),
shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance
with the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the
Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the Act or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions
required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the director in accordance with part 216 of the chapter. In conjunction
with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration
judge, if the respondent is inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act and believes that he or she
meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration
judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent of his or her apparent eligibility to apply
for any of the benefits enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an opportunity to make application
therefor during the hearing. In exercising discretionary power when considering an application under this paragraph,
the immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not contained in the record and not made available
for inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is relevant and
is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 (47 14874, April 6, 1982) as requiring protection from unauthorized
disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while
safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge should inform the respondent of the general
nature of the information in order that the respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision
based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the information is material to the decision.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Housing Finance Board (Board) is proposing 
to amend in its entirety its regulation governing the operation of 
the Affordable Housing Program (AHP or Program). The proposed 
rule modifies or carries forward requirements of the Board's 
existing AHP regulation, adds new provisions, and incorporates, 
with modifications, the provisions of the Board's existing policy 
guidelines governing the award of funds to loan funds and loan 
consortia. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Statutory and Regulatory Background 


A. General 


Section 10(j)(1) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Act) 
requires each Federal Home Loan Bank (Bank) to establish a Program 
to subsidize the interest rate on advances to members of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank System (Bank System) engaged in lending for 
long-term, low- and moderate-income, owner-occupied and affordable 
rental housing at subsidized interest rates. The Board is 
required to promulgate regulations governing the Program. 
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(1). The Board's existing regulation governing the operation of the AHP appears at part 960 of the
Board's 
regulations. 12 CFR part 960. 
This proposed rule amends the Board's existing AHP regulation 
to address operational issues that have arisen during the three 
and one-half years that the AHP has been in existence. The 
proposed amendments are intended to make the AHP more responsive 
to low-income housing needs in each of the twelve Federal Home 
Loan Bank Districts (Districts), to increase efficiency in the 
administration of the Program, and to enhance coordination of the 
AHP with other housing programs whose funds are used in 
conjunction with AHP funds. These issues are discussed in greater 
detail below in the Analysis of Proposed Rule section. 


II. Analysis of Proposed Rule 


A. AHP Application Approval Process 



The proposed rule makes a fundamental change to the AHP by 
vesting the Banks, instead of the Board, with the authority to 
approve AHP applications. The current application approval 
process implemented by the Board's existing AHP regulation may be 
briefly described as follows. The Banks receive AHP applications 
and first evaluate them for satisfaction of certain threshold 
requirements contained in the existing regulation. See 12 CFR 
960.5(a)(1), (2). Those applications meeting the threshold 
requirements are evaluated by the Banks to determine if they meet at least three of the priorities contained in the
existing 
regulation. If they do, they are scored by the Banks on the 
priorities and on other scoring objectives contained in the 
existing regulation before applications that meet fewer than three 
priorities. See 

id. 

 960.5(a)(3), (b) through (e). Under the 
existing regulation, the Bank then forwards to the Board the 
highest scoring applications, and submits a summary of such 
applications. See 

id. 

 960.5(f)(1), (2). The Board reviews the 
applications to ensure consistency with the threshold, priorities 
and scoring requirements, and makes final funding decisions on the 
applications. See 

id. 

 960.5(f)(3).

While section 10(j) of the Act requires each Bank to establish 
an AHP, and vests in the Board broad authority to regulate the 
Banks' AHP activities through regulations implementing the Act, 
section 10(j) does not specifically assign the responsibility of 
operating the AHP to the Board. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). The Board 
does have other statutorily designated duties, including issuing 
regulations that specify activities eligible to receive subsidized 
advances under the AHP, ensuring advances are used to assist 
projects for which adequate long-term monitoring is available, 
ensuring that a preponderance of assistance provided under the AHP 
is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income households, and 
ensuring that AHP subsidies provided by Banks to members are 
passed on to the ultimate borrower. See 

id. 

Section 1430(j)(9) (A), (C), 
(D), (E). However, section 10(j) does not specify what entity is 
responsible for administering the AHP, and what entity is 
responsible for determining which AHP applications are approved 
for funding. 

For the following reasons, the Board is proposing that the 
Banks assume the responsibility for determining which AHP 
applications are approved for funding. First, the Banks have had 
three and one-half years of experience with the AHP, which 
experience has included processing AHP applications, scoring the 
applications, and recommending applications for approval to the 
Board as described above. Consequently, the Banks are already 
processing and reviewing applications under the existing system. 

Second, decentralization of the AHP is consistent with the Bank 
System's Strategic Plan, which calls for decentralization of a 
number of functions currently conducted by the Board, with the 
exception of those Board activities involving oversight and 
supervision of the Banks. See ``System 2000: A Long-Term Strategic 
Plan For The Federal Home Loan Bank System.'' 

The details of the proposed new application approval process 
are discussed further below. 

The Board specifically requests comments as to whether the 
Banks should be given the authority to approve and disapprove AHP 
applications. 

The proposed rule also revises the Board's existing AHP 
regulation by allowing each Bank to define more specifically its 
own priorities and scoring criteria, subject to certain overall 
priority and scoring parameters established in the proposed rule. 
The Bank would be required to include such proposed priorities and 
scoring criteria in its AHP implementation plan which must be 
approved by the Board. Under the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
the Banks have much less flexibility in defining priorities and 
scoring criteria. See 12 CFR 960.5 (a) through (e). In addition, 
under the proposed rule, certain point values for scoring 
categories would be revised. 

The details of the proposed revisions for adopting priorities 
and scoring criteria are discussed further below under the scoring 
of AHP applications section. 



B. Bank Establishment of AHP and Adoption of AHP Implementation 
Plan 



Section 960.2(a) of the proposed rule generally reiterates the 
statement in  960.2(a) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
that it is the policy of the Board and the Banks to promote decent 
and safe affordable housing and to address critical affordable 
housing needs through providing subsidized advances and direct 
subsidies to members pursuant to the AHP. See 12 CFR 960.2(a). 

Section 960.2(b) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank's 
board of directors shall establish an AHP, which shall be funded 
pursuant to the requirements of  960.18 of the proposed rule. 
(See discussion below under the required annual AHP contributions 
section.) The Bank is required to make subsidized advances to 
applicants pursuant to its AHP and to operate its AHP in 
conformity with an annual AHP implementation plan and the 
requirements of this part. Direct subsidies provided by a Bank to 
applicants pursuant to its AHP also shall be provided in 
conformity with the Bank's AHP implementation plan and the 
requirements of this part. Each Bank's AHP implementation plan 
shall be approved by the Board before it is effective. 

Section 960.2(b) of the proposed rule further provides that the 
AHP implementation plan must meet the requirements of this part, 
and shall include:

(1) The Bank's AHP funding cycle schedule, including 
application due dates, as required by proposed  960.6(a)(1); 

(2) The Bank's priorities, and scoring criteria for 
applications, as required by proposed   960.8(a) and 960.10; 

(3) The Bank's procedures to ensure satisfaction of the 
long-term requirement, as required by proposed  960.5 (a)(1) and 
(b); 

(4) The Bank's requirements for and verification procedures 
concerning (i) the use of subsidized advances or direct subsidies 
within a reasonable period of time after approval of an AHP 
application, as required by proposed  960.12(a), or (ii) the use of loans or grants within a 
reasonable period of time after repayment of such funds to a loan 
fund or loan consortium, as required by proposed  960.17(c)(5); 

(5) The Bank's verification procedures upon initial 
disbursement of subsidized advances or direct subsidies, as 
required by proposed  960.13; 

(6) The Bank's monitoring plan, as required by proposed 
 960.14(b); 

(7) The Bank's reporting requirements for applicants during the 
construction or rehabilitation phase, as required by proposed 
 960.15(b)(2); 

(8) An explanation of circumstances justifying undue hardship 
waivers by the Bank of imposition of remedial actions, as required 
by proposed  960.16 (c)(1) and (d)(1); and 

(9) The Bank's determination regarding the number of persons 
that may serve on the Bank's Advisory Council and their terms, as 
required by proposed  960.21(a)(1) and (4). 

Section 960.2(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank's 
proposed AHP implementation plan shall be submitted to its 
Advisory Council at least 45 calendar days before it is considered 
by the Bank's board of directors. The Advisory Council shall 
review the proposed plan and submit its recommendations to the 
Bank's board of directors at least seven calendar days before the 
Bank's board of directors is scheduled to vote on the proposed 
plan. The Bank's board of directors shall vote on the proposed 
AHP implementation plan, and shall submit its approved plan to the 
Board for action. The Board shall approve or disapprove the 
proposed plan within 60 calendar days of receipt. The Bank's plan 
is not effective until it is approved by the Board, and it must 
become effective at least 45 calendar days before the due date for 
AHP applications established by the Bank. Each Bank must submit 
its AHP implementation plan to the Board for approval no later 
than 180 calendar days after the publication of this rule as a 
final rule in the 

Federal Register

. 

Section 960.2(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank's 
approved AHP implementation plan shall be made available by the 
Bank to the public upon request. 

Section 960.2(e) of the proposed rule provides that the Board 
will approve or disapprove proposed amendments to a Bank's 
approved AHP implementation plan submitted by the Bank within 60 
calendar days of receipt. 



C. Authorized and Required Uses of AHP Subsidized Advances or 
Direct Subsidies 



Section 960.3 of the proposed rule states the general 
authorized uses of AHP subsidized advances and direct subsidies by 
applicants,  960.4 provides specific examples of such authorized 
and unauthorized uses and other use requirements, and  960.5 sets 
forth the long-term income-eligibility, affordability and 
income-targeting requirements for such uses. These proposed 
sections are discussed further below. 



1. Authorized Uses of Subsidized Advances or Direct 
Subsidies 



Section 960.3 of the proposed rule, consistent with 
 960.3(b) (1) and (2) of the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
provides that applicants may use subsidized advances or direct 
subsidies received from a Bank under the AHP to either: 

(a) Finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of 
owner-occupied housing units by or for low- or moderate-income 
households; or 

(b) Finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of 
rental housing units, at least 20 percent of the units of which 
will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income households. 
See 12 CFR 960.3(b) (1) and (2). 



2. Specific Use Requirements for Subsidized Advances or 
Direct Subsidies 



Section 960.3(c) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
provides that ``Program funds may only be used for direct costs 
required to produce and/or finance affordable housing units.'' 
12 CFR 960.3(c). A number of questions have arisen as to whether 
specific types of costs associated with the financing or 
production of housing may be considered ``direct costs'' for 
purposes of the Board's regulation. Because of the confusion in 
this area, the Board believes that it would be helpful to set 
forth in the rule examples of specific types of costs it considers 
to be authorized and unauthorized for AHP purposes. Accordingly, 
 960.4(a) (1) and (2) of the proposed rule sets forth examples of 
specific costs related to the purchase, construction or 
rehabilitation of housing that are authorized and unauthorized 
uses of AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies. However, 
because it is impossible to anticipate all types of costs that may 
arise in the course of financing or producing housing, the list of 
authorized and unauthorized costs in proposed  960.4(a) is not 
exclusive. Other costs not included arguably may or may not 
qualify as costs of financing the purchase, construction or 
rehabilitation of housing. If an applicant seeks to use funds 
under the AHP to pay for costs not specifically included in this 
rule, it should consult with the Bank before submitting its 
application for approval. The Board specifically asks for 
comments as to whether these authorized and unauthorized costs are 
appropriate.

Specifically,  960.4(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that 
authorized uses of subsidized advances or direct subsidies 
include, but are not limited to, the following costs related to 
the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing: 

(i) Real property purchase and improvement costs; 

(ii) Construction or rehabilitation costs, including labor and 
materials, and contractor profit and overhead allowances; 

(iii) Costs integral to the purchase or development of housing 
including, but not limited to, project-related: Architectural, 
inspection and engineering fees; local building permit and 
planning fees; accounting costs; survey costs; appraisal fees; 
title insurance and other insurance costs; performance bond and 
other bond fees; recording fees; credit report fees; property 
taxes; residential relocation costs where such costs are part of a 
relocation plan; legal fees; syndication fees; costs of 
translating resident documents to another language; loan 
commitment, loan origination and other loan financing fees for 
administrative costs other than costs of administering the AHP 
award; developer's fees; and marketing costs; 

(iv) Prepayment fees imposed by the Bank on an applicant for a 
subsidized advance that is prepaid in connection with the 
purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing, if the 
applicant requires the borrower to pay such fee; 

(v) Capitalization of reserve fund(s) necessary for the 
successful operation of rental housing projects, including 
replacement reserves, rent-up reserves, operating deficit 
reserves, and sinking fund reserves used for the transfer of the 
project to nonprofit ownership when associated with a low income 
housing tax credit transaction (26 U.S.C. 42); 

(vi) Cancellation fees imposed by the Bank on an applicant for 
a subsidized advance commitment that is canceled and converted to 
and disbursed as a direct subsidy in connection with the purchase, 
construction or rehabilitation of housing, if the applicant 
requires the borrower to pay such fee; 

(vii) Refinancing of an existing loan in conjunction with the 
purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing, provided the 
subsidized advance or direct subsidy and the proceeds of the 
refinancing are used only to retire existing debt and to benefit 
low- or moderate-income households and, in the case of refinancing 
in order to rehabilitate a project, there is a minimum of $2,500 
per unit spent on such rehabilitation; and 

(viii) Tenant services, tenant counseling and homeowner 
counseling costs that are a condition imposed by a lender to 
obtain financing from such lender and which are necessary for the 
successful operation of the project.

<TEXT>
 

Cancellation fees identified in paragraph (vi) above, where 
there is purchase, construction or rehabilitation of housing and 
the borrower is required to pay the fee, are a cost of financing 
such purchase, construction or rehabilitation and therefore are 
authorized uses of funds under the AHP. Because the advance would 
be converted to a direct subsidy, such cancellation fees would be 
payable only if the application also meets the requirements for 
modification of applications contained in  960.11 of the proposed 
rule. (These requirements are discussed in greater detail in the 
modification section below.) However, AHP subsidized advances or 
direct subsidies may not be used to pay for cancellation fees in 
situations where the cancellation of the advance is not part of a 
restructuring that results in the purchase, construction or 
rehabilitation of housing. 

The conditions identified in paragraph (vii) above on the use 
of funds under the AHP for refinancing are intended to ensure that 
the funds are not used by the borrower to take out its equity in 
the project and to ensure that the funds are used for authorized 
purposes under the AHP. The Board specifically requests comments 
on whether the $2,500 minimum per unit is a reasonable minimum 
amount to be required to be spent on rehabilitation in conjunction 
with a refinancing. 

Questions have arisen as to whether funds under the AHP should 
be used to pay for pre-development costs that may or may not 
result in the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of AHP 
housing. Pre-development costs are costs incurred prior to the 
closing of a purchase, construction or rehabilitation loan for the 
purpose of determining the feasibility of a proposed project. 
Examples of pre-development costs include architectural and 
engineering fees, legal fees, the costs of surveys and appraisals, 
local building permit and planning fees, and earnest money 
deposits. Since AHP applications are required to meet the 
threshold feasibility requirement provided in proposed  960.9(d) 
in order to be scored, authorizing the use of funds for 
pre-development costs raises the question how applications for 
such costs can or should be scored since the funds would be 
disbursed to applicants before the feasibility of a proposed 
project could be established. 

In addition, there is a greater likelihood that costs incurred 
during the pre-feasibility period, rather than during the 
post-feasibility period, will not result in the purchase, 
construction or rehabilitation of housing. Thus, if applications 
for AHP funds to finance pre-development costs are approved, AHP 
funds in perhaps significant amounts could go towards 
pre-development costs that do not result in the financing or 
production of housing. If such costs are authorized, one option 
for dealing with this concern could be to cap the total amount of 
AHP funds that may be used for pre-development costs at a specific 
dollar amount or percentage, such as the lesser of $200,000 or 5 
percent of the Bank's total AHP contributions for the year. These 
funds could be set aside and disbursed in a separate competitive 
process. 

The Board specifically requests comments on whether funds under 
the AHP should be used for pre-development costs, how applications 
for such costs can or should be scored, and what limits, if any, 
should be placed on the amount of funds used for such purposes 
under the AHP. 



3. Use of Funds Requirements 



Section 960.4(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 
total amount of a direct subsidy provided by the Bank to an 
applicant under the AHP must be passed on by the applicant to the 
recipient. Consistent with  960.9(c) of the Board's existing AHP 
regulation,  960.4(b)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that 
an applicant receiving a subsidized advance shall extend credit to 
the borrower at a rate of interest equal to the rate of interest 
charged on the subsidized advance plus an interest rate spread 
approved by the Bank. See 12 CFR 960.9(c). These provisions 
implement section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act, which provides that the 
Board's AHP regulation shall ensure that AHP subsidies provided by 
Banks to applicants are passed on to the ultimate borrower. See 
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). 

Section 960.4(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
applicant receives a subsidized advance or direct subsidy from a 
Bank or prepayment of a loan originally made under the AHP, any 
interest or other income earned by the applicant on such funds, 
not including any approved fee or interest rate spread charged to 
the borrower, must be forwarded to the Bank to be used for 
additional AHP projects, except for interest or other income 
earned by the applicant within 30 calendar days of receiving the 
subsidized advance or direct subsidy or of receiving prepayment of 
a loan originally made under the AHP. 

Section 960.4(b)(3) of the proposed rule provides that a direct 
subsidy received by an applicant from a Bank that is provided by 
such applicant to a sponsor may be lent by the sponsor in 
connection with an AHP rental housing project involving low-income 
housing tax credits (LIHTC), provided the subsidy is lent by the 
sponsor for a term of not less than 30 years, with all principal 
and interest payments deferred until the end of such term. If 
such a loan is repaid before the end of the 30-year term, the 
entire amount of the direct subsidy must be repaid to the Bank.

<TEXT>
 

For various tax reasons, sponsors prefer to structure LIHTC 
projects so that the AHP direct subsidy is lent to the project for 
a specific long-term period, with principal and interest payments 
deferred until the end of such term. The lending of a direct 
subsidy by a sponsor raises the question whether the subsidy is 
being passed on to the ultimate recipient, as required under 
section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act and proposed  960.4(b)(1)(i), 
since the subsidy ultimately is being repaid to the Bank. See 
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). The Board believes that the lending of a 
direct subsidy for the long-term period of income eligibility and 
affordability required by  960.5 of the proposed rule, with all 
principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such 
term, satisfies section 10(j)(9)(E) and proposed  960.4(b)(1)(i), 
because the project will have had the use of such funds for the 
period the project must remain occupied by and affordable for low- 
or moderate-income households, even though the funds may be repaid 
at the end of such term. As discussed below,  960.5(a)(1) of the 
proposed rule defines this long-term period generally as not less 
than 30 years for rental housing projects. Accordingly, the 
direct subsidy must be lent for a term of 30 years or more, with 
all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such 
term. 

Section 960.4(b)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
applicant receives a subsidized advance or a direct subsidy from a 
Bank, and in turn provides both a loan and a grant to a borrower 
and charges an origination fee for providing the loan, then any 
fee charged by the applicant for providing the grant may not be 
paid with the AHP subsidized advance or direct subsidy. The fee 
may not be paid with the AHP subsidized advance because the 
applicant has already covered the underwriting costs for the loan 
and the grant in its origination fee for the loan. The fee may 
not be paid with the direct subsidy because otherwise the entire 
amount of the AHP subsidy would not be passed through to the 
borrower, as required by section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act and 
proposed  960.4(b)(1)(i). See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). 



4. Long-term Requirements 



a. 

Owner-occupied housing units.

 (1) Long-term requirement. 
Section 10(j)(1) of the Act states that pursuant to regulations 
promulgated by the Board, each Bank shall establish a Program to 
subsidize the interest rate on advances to members engaged in 
lending for long-term, low- and moderate-income, owner-occupied 
housing at subsidized interest rates. 

Id.

  1430(j)(1). In 
addition, section 10(j)(2)(A) of the Act states that the Board's 
regulations shall permit Bank members to use subsidized advances 
received from the Banks to finance homeownership by families with 
incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income for the area. 


Id.

  1430(j)(2)(A). 

The Act permits more than one possible interpretation of the 
requirement that owner-occupied housing must be ``long-term.'' One 
way to interpret this requirement is that owner-occupied housing 
units assisted under the AHP must be added to and retained as part 
of the stock of affordable housing for a long-term period. 
Alternatively, the Act may be interpreted to require that under 
the AHP, assistance must be provided to low- or moderate-income 
households to make owner-occupied housing units affordable to such 
households for as long as they own the unit. These two possible 
interpretations are incorporated in options A and B described 
below. The Board specifically requests comments on these two 
options. 

Option A. Under option A, the long-term requirement would be met by 
providing that owner-occupied housing units be required to be 
retained as affordable units for 30 years or, at the election of 
the sponsor, the remaining useful life of the units, regardless of 
changes in occupancy. In order to enforce this retention 
requirement, owner-occupied units assisted with a loan or a grant 
under the AHP would have to be subject to a deed restriction or 
other legally enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of the 
unit to a low- or moderate-income household if the unit were sold 
within 30 years of the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation 
or prior to the end of the remaining useful life of the unit, as 
the case may be. 

A household purchasing such a unit would have to qualify as a 
low- or moderate-income household only at the time of purchase or 
at the time of closing on the financing for the unit. A household 
rehabilitating a unit would have to qualify as a low- or 
moderate-income household only at the time the household received 
a commitment for funding through the AHP.

If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were 
sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining 
useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that 
was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant 
would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the 
advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that 
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a 
market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate 
of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP 
subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that 
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would 
be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. 

If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP 
were sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining 
useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that 
was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller would 
have to repay to the applicant a 

pro rata

 portion of the grant 
from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any amount 
repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the Bank and 
made available for additional AHP projects. The Bank would have 
the discretion to waive this recapture requirement if imposition 
of the requirement would cause undue hardship on the seller, as 
defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. In addition, for 
owner-occupied units assisted by a grant, the Bank would have to 
monitor the unit during the required long-term period by reviewing 
land title records or reports or certifications from the sponsor 
or a regulatory agency, as determined by each Bank in its AHP 
implementation plan, to determine whether the unit had been sold 
to a household whose income exceeded a low-or moderate-income. 

As an alternative to requiring that each owner-occupied unit 
assisted by a grant be subject to a restriction on transfer, the 
Bank could have a legally binding agreement with the sponsor 
providing that if such unit were sold prior to the end of the 
required long-term period to a household that was not a low- or 
moderate-income household, the sponsor would make another unit 
available to a low- or moderate-income household. 

Option B. 
Under option B, the long-term requirement would be met by 
providing that an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant or a 
loan under the AHP must be affordable for the initial household 
for the duration of that household's occupancy of the unit. 
However, to minimize opportunities for speculation, the unit would 
have to be subject to a deed restriction or other legally 
enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of the unit to a low- 
or moderate-income household if the unit were sold within five 
years of the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of the 
unit. 

As under option A, a household purchasing such a unit under 
option B would have to qualify as a low- or moderate-income 
household only at the time of purchase or at the time of closing 
on the financing for the unit, and a household rehabilitating a 
unit would have to qualify as a low- or moderate-income household 
only at the time the household received a commitment for funding 
through the AHP. 

If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were 
sold prior to the end of the five-year period to a household that 
was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant 
would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the 
advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that 
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a 
market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate 
of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP 
subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that 
portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would 
be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. 

If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP 
were sold prior to the end of the five-year period to a household 
that was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller 
would have to repay to the applicant a 

pro rata

 portion of the 
grant from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any 
amount repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the 
Bank and made available for additional AHP projects. The Bank 
would have the discretion to waive this recapture requirement if 
imposition of the requirement would cause undue hardship on the 
seller, as defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. In 
addition, for owner-occupied units assisted by a grant, the Bank 
would have to monitor the unit during the required long-term 
period by reviewing land title records or reports or 
certifications from the sponsor or a regulatory agency, as 
determined by each Bank in its AHP implementation plan, to 
determine whether the unit had been sold to a household whose 
income exceeded a low or moderate income. 

As under option A, as an alternative to requiring that each 
owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant be subject to a 
restriction on transfer, the Bank under option B could have a 
legally binding agreement with the sponsor providing that if such 
unit were sold prior to the end of the required long-term period 
to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, 
the sponsor would make another unit available to a low- or 
moderate-income household.

(2) Definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and 
``very low-income household''. Section 10(j)(13)(A) of the Act defines the term ``low- or 
moderate-income household'' as a household which has an income of 
80 percent or less of the area median. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(A). 
Section 10(j)(13)(B) of the Act defines the term ``very low-income 
household'' as a household that has an income of 50 percent or less 
of the area median. 

Id.

 section 1430(j)(13)(B). Thus, the term low- or moderate-income household incorporates households that meet the

definition of very low-income household. 
The Board's existing AHP regulation defines ``low- and 
moderate-income households'' as households for which the aggregate 
income is 80 percent or less of the area median income, and ``very 
low-income households'' as households for which the aggregate 
income is 50 percent or less of the area median income. See 
12 CFR 960.1(g), (o). ``Median income'' is defined as ``the median 
family income for an area as determined and published by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development.'' 

Id. 

 960.1(h). 
``Area'' is defined as ``a metropolitan statistical area, a county, 
or a nonmetropolitan area, as established by the U.S. Office of 
Management and Budget.'' 

Id. 

 960.1(c). 
(i) Adjustments of income limit. 
On November 5, 1993, the Board published a proposed rule to 
amend the definitions of these terms. See 58 FR 58988 
(November 5, 1993). As discussed in the preamble to the proposed 
amendment, under section 3 of the United States Housing Act of 
1937, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (Secretary) establishes income limits to be used in 
determining whether a family qualifies as a ``low-income family'' or 
as a ``very low-income family'' that is eligible to receive 
assistance under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
(HUD) housing programs. See 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). These income 
limits are calculated as a percentage of the median income of a 
four-person family living in a particular area. In general, the 
income limit for qualifying as a ``low-income family'' is set at 80 
percent of the area median income, and the income limit for 
qualifying as a ``very low-income family'' is set at 50 percent of 
the area median income. 
The Secretary may adjust the income limits for very low-income 
families and low-income families upward or downward to take into 
account unusually high or low family incomes in an area. See 

id. 


In addition, the income limit for low-income families may be 
adjusted to take into account prevailing levels of construction 
costs. See 

id. 

Then an adjustment in this figure is made to 
establish the comparable income limits for larger and smaller 
families living in the area. See 

id. 
In 31 higher-income metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and 
18 counties, the Secretary adjusts the area-based income limit for 
a four-person, low-income family downward if it would otherwise 
exceed the U.S. median income for a four-person family. In these 
areas, the Secretary caps the income limit for a four-person, 
low-income family at the U.S. median income for a four-person 
family. 
In four MSAs and 107 counties, the Secretary adjusts the 
area-based income limit for four-person, very low- and low-income 
families downward because housing costs are low compared to 
incomes. 
Adjusting the income limit downward decreases the number of 
households in an area that are eligible to receive assistance 
under HUD's housing programs. 
As discussed in the proposed amendment, the Board believes that 
affordable housing financed through the AHP should be available to 
the greatest number of households possible, within the limits 
established by the Act. Further, households should not be 
excluded from affordable housing in a particular local market on 
the basis that housing costs are lower or household incomes are 
higher in that market than in other regions of the United States. 
Applying the income limits that have been adjusted downward for 
prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or unusually 
high household incomes for purposes of administering the AHP 
reduces the number of households eligible to live in affordable 
housing financed through the AHP. This limits a member's ability 
to use funds under the AHP to fulfill its obligation under the 
Community Reinvestment Act. See 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq. 

It also 
limits a member's ability to use funds under the AHP to meet the 
``community investment or service'' requirement of section 10(g) of 
the Act, 12 U.S.C. 1430(g), and the Board's Community Support 
Regulation, 12 CFR part 936. 
Accordingly, the Board is proposing that in administering the 
AHP and in defining the standards governing the ``community 
investment or service'' requirement of the Act, the income limits 
used to determine whether a household in a particular area 
qualifies as a ``very low-income household'' or as a ``low- or 
moderate-income household'' should not be adjusted downward based 
on prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or unusually 
high household incomes. 
Therefore, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment, 
 960.1 of this proposed rule defines ``low- or moderate-income 
household'' as a household which has an income of 80 percent or 
less of the median income for the area, as adjusted and published 
by HUD, except in areas where the Secretary adjusts this figure 
downward because of prevailing construction costs, low housing 
costs, or unusually high household incomes. For areas where the 
Secretary makes this downward adjustment, ``low- or moderate-income 
household'' would be defined to mean a household which has an 
income of 80 percent or less of the median income for the area, as 
published by HUD, with adjustment for household size, but without 
the adjustments made by the Secretary for prevailing construction 
costs, low housing costs, or unusually high household incomes.

In addition, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment, 
 960.1 of this proposed rule defines ``very low-income household'' 
as a household which has an income of 50 percent or less of the 
median income for the area, as adjusted and published by HUD, 
except in areas where the Secretary adjusts this figure downward 
because of prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or 
unusually high household incomes. For areas where the Secretary 
makes this downward adjustment, ``very low-income household'' would 
be defined to mean a household which has an income of 50 percent 
or less of the median income for the area, as published by HUD, 
with adjustment for household size, but without the adjustments 
made by the Secretary for prevailing construction costs, low 
housing costs, or unusually high household incomes. 
While HUD publishes tables with adjusted income information 
that incorporates the adjustments for family size, prevailing 
construction costs, low housing costs, and unusually high family 
incomes, it does not publish tables with income information that 
adjusts only for family size and not these other factors. 
Therefore, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment,  960.1 
of this proposed rule adds a definition of ``adjustment for 
household size'' in order to provide additional guidance in 
calculating this adjustment. 
An adjustment for household size is made by taking a specified 
percentage of the income limit of a four-person household for a 
particular area, according to the following scale: 




 

For each person in excess of eight, eight percent of the four-person household base income limit should be added to
the 
income limit for an eight-person household for the area. These 
adjustment factors are the same as those used by HUD in 
administering its housing programs. 
Section 960.1 of the proposed rule retains the definition of 
``area'' from the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR 
960.1(c). ``Area'' means, for purposes of defining ``median income 
for the area,'' a metropolitan statistical area, a county, or a 
nonmetropolitan area, as established by the U.S. Office of 
Management and Budget. Consistent with the proposed amendment, 
 960.1 of this proposed rule does not include a definition of 
``median income'' because it is included in the proposed definitions 
of ``very low-income household'' and ``low- or moderate-income 
household.'' 
(ii) Definition of ``income''. The Act is silent on how to define the term ``income,'' 

i.e.,

 
what are eligible sources of household income that should be 
considered in determining whether the household satisfies the 
definition of ``low- or moderate-income household'' or ``very 
low-income household.'' The Board has determined not to define the 
term ``income'' in the proposed rule. Homeownership projects 
typically involve the participation of a lender which provides 
permanent financing for the homeowner over an extended period of 
time. The lender generally verifies a household's income prior to 
issuing a financing commitment during the underwriting of the 
loan. Eligible sources of income are identified by the lender 
during the mortgage underwriting process. Identifying eligible 
sources of income in the rule could cause inconsistency with 
lenders' customary and usual underwriting practices, or with the 
standards applied by the entity providing the major source of 
financing for the project. 
b. 

Rental housing units. 

Section 960.5(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides generally that at least 20 percent of the rental housing units in
a project financed under the AHP with subsidized advances or direct 
subsidies shall remain affordable for and occupied by very 
low-income households for a minimum period of 30 years or, at the 
election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units.

Proposed  960.5(a)(1) implements section 10(j)(2)(B) of the 
Act, which provides that Bank members may use subsidized advances 
received from the Banks to finance the purchase, construction, or 
rehabilitation of rental housing, at least 20 percent of the units 
of which will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income 
households for the remaining useful life of such housing or the 
mortgage term. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(2)(B). 
Proposed  960.5(a)(1) provides that the applicant and project 
sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment 
regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility, 
affordability and income-targeting requirements. In addition, an 
applicant may commit to maintain additional units as affordable 
for and occupied by low- or moderate-income households, which 
commitment shall be a minimum period of 30 years or, at the 
election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units. 

(1) 

Long-term requirement. 

Section 10(j) of the Act does not define ``remaining useful life'' as used in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act. See 12
U.S.C. 1430(j). However, the legislative history of section 21A(c) of 
the Act regarding residential properties sold by the Resolution 
Trust Corporation (RTC), which was enacted as part of the same 
legislation that enacted section 10(j), states that the remaining 
useful life of such RTC property is intended to cover the property 
as long as it is habitable and assumes good faith efforts by the 
purchaser to maintain the property and to rehabilitate it as 
necessary. See Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of 
the Conference, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-222, 101st Cong., 1st 
Sess., 419 (1989) (FIRREA Conference Report); 12 U.S.C. 1441a(c). 
The RTC has in fact adopted a specific uniform period of useful 
life for all buildings instead of a period of useful life based on 
physical habitability. See 12 CFR 1609.2(kk). The legislative 
history of a recently enacted affordable housing statute, the Low 
Income Housing Preservation and Residential Homeownership Act 
(LIHPRHA), provides further support for a definition of ``remaining 
useful life'' based on the period of physical habitability of a 
property by explicitly rejecting the RTC's regulatory definition. 
Accordingly,  960.1 of the proposed rule defines ``remaining 
useful life'' as the period during which the housing remains in a 
condition suitable for occupancy, assuming normal maintenance and 
repairs are made and major systems and capital components are 
replaced or repaired as becomes necessary. 
Section 10(j) of the Act does not define ``mortgage term'' as 
used in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). 
The legislative history of section 10(j) states that the conferees 
expect that the Board will encourage the use of the longest 
practicable mortgage term in order to aid in making the housing 
affordable for very low-income households. See FIRREA Conference 
Report at 431. Accordingly, the Board believes that ``mortgage 
term'' should be defined as the mortgage term only of long-term 
mortgage loans and believes that 30 years is consistent with 
Congress' intent in section 10(j)(2)(B) of the Act to ensure that 
AHP-assisted rental housing projects remain occupied by and 
affordable for income-eligible households for a long-term period. 
(2) Definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and 
``very low-income household''. 
The definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and 
``very low-income household'' discussed above for AHP-assisted 
owner-occupied housing projects apply for AHP-assisted rental 
housing projects as well. 
With respect to the definition of ``income,'' rental housing 
projects typically have multiple providers of financing, each of 
which may specify the eligible sources of income, which sometimes 
conflict with each other. However, as with AHP-assisted 
owner-occupied housing projects, the Board has determined that the 
proposed rule should not specify the eligible sources of income 
for rental housing projects, but rather that applicants should be 
permitted to follow their usual underwriting guidelines, or may 
follow those of the predominant source of financing in the 
project.

(3) Increase in household income or sale of project before end 
of required long-term period. (i) 

Increase in household income. 


Section 960.5(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that all 
households occupying a rental housing unit subject to the 
income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
must satisfy the income-eligibility requirement applicable to such 
income-targeted unit, as committed to in the AHP application, upon 
initial occupancy. The household may continue to occupy the 
income-targeted unit even if its income increases above the 
income-eligibility requirement for such unit. The unit may 
continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting requirement 
committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent charged 
remains affordable to the household as defined in proposed  960.1 
(as further discussed below). However, if the household's income 
rises above 140 percent of the income-targeting level committed to 
in the AHP application, the sponsor must make the next available 
rental housing unit in the project affordable to and available for 
occupancy by a household whose income is at or below the 
income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application for the 
original unit. Once the next available rental housing unit is so 
occupied, the rent charged on the unit occupied by the household 
whose income has risen shall no longer be subject to the 
requirement that it be affordable for households at the 
income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application. 
This approach is consistent with the approach followed in the 
LIHTC program. Under the LIHTC program, a unit is in compliance 
with the occupancy requirements until the tenant's income has 
risen to 140 percent of the qualifying income. See 26 U.S.C. 
 42(g)(2)(D)(i). The next available unit must then be rented to an 
income-eligible tenant at an affordable rent. See 

id. 

Section 42(g)(2)(D)(ii). This approach allows the household to achieve 
stability by allowing increases in income without fear of 
displacement or increased rents. In addition, it does not cause 
destabilization of the project's cash flow by having the project 
sponsor provide additional income-eligible units with reduced 
rents that may reduce the income of the project. It also would be 
consistent with the treatment of rents under the AHP's 20 percent 
requirement (also known as the maximum subsidy rule), which is 
currently an interim rule of the Board, and which is incorporated 
in  960.9(c) of this proposed rule. (See discussion of 20 
percent requirement below.) 

Section 960.1 of the proposed rule defines ``affordable for very 
low-income households'' to mean: 
(1) For purposes of rental housing units, that rents, including 
reasonable utility costs, charged to households for such units do 
not exceed 30 percent of the income of a household (assuming a 
household size of 1.5 persons per bedroom or 1.0 person per unit 
without a separate bedroom) which has an income of 50 percent of 
the median income for the area, as adjusted and published by HUD, 
except that in areas where the Secretary adjusts this income 
figure downward because of prevailing construction costs, low 
housing costs, or unusually high household incomes, then 
``affordable for very low-income households'' means that rents, 
including reasonable utility costs, charged to households for such 
units do not exceed 30 percent of the income of a household which 
has an income of 50 percent of the median income for the area, as 
published by HUD, with adjustment for household size, but without 
the adjustments made by the Secretary for prevailing construction 
costs, low housing costs, or unusually high household incomes; 
(2) If a rental unit is targeted to a household whose income is 
less than 50 percent of the median income for the area, then 
``affordable for very low-income households'' means that the rent, 
including reasonable utility costs, charged to a household for 
such unit does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum qualifying 
income of the targeted households of the size expected to occupy 
the unit. 

This proposed definition implements section 10(j)(13)(D) of the 
Act, which defines ``affordable for very low-income households'' to 
mean that rents charged to tenants for units made available for 
occupancy by low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of 
the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of 
the income for the area (as determined by the Secretary of HUD) 
with adjustment for family size. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(D). 
Section 960.1(b) of the Board's existing AHP regulation contains a 
definition of the term that is similar to the statutory 
definition. See 12 CFR 960.1(b).

The Board has determined that an estimate for reasonable 
utility costs should be included in the determination of rents 
charged to households under this section, if they are not already 
included in the projected rents. Including utility costs would 
reduce the housing cost burden for very low-income households 
under the AHP, and would allow all rental projects to be treated 
equally, since some projects include the cost of utilities in the 
rent, while others do not include such costs in the rent. 
Including utility costs would be consistent with the treatment of 
rents in other federal housing programs, such as HUD's Section 8 
program and the LIHTC program. It also would be consistent with 
the treatment of rents under the AHP's 20 percent requirement, 
which is currently an interim rule of the Board, and which is 
incorporated in  960.9(c) of this proposed rule. (See discussion 
of 20 percent requirement below.) 

The definition of ``affordable for low- or moderate-income 
households'' in  960.1 of the proposed rule is similar to the 
above definition, except that the household must have an income of 
80 percent, instead of 50 percent, of the median income for the 
area, since the Act defines a ``low- or moderate-income household'' 
as any household which has an income of 80 percent or less of the 
area median. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(A). 

(ii) 

Sale of AHP-assisted rental housing project.

 
Section 960.5(a)(3) of the proposed rule provides that an owner 
of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell the project 
prior to the end of the long-term period during which the 
project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must remain 
affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below 
the levels committed to in the AHP application; however, either: 

a. The purchaser must agree to continue the project's rental 
units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and 
occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the 
long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must 
agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that 
applied to the seller; or 

b. If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in 
paragraph a. above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to 
the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the 
seller must repay a 

pro rata

 portion of the grant as provided in 
 960.16(d)(1); or 

c. If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in 
paragraph a. above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance 
to the applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan 
to the seller, then the provisions of  960.16(d)(2) shall apply. 

Proposed  960.5(b) further provides that the Bank's AHP 
implementation plan shall permit the owner of an AHP-assisted 
rental housing project to sell such project as provided for in 
paragraph (a)(3). 

D. Establishment of AHP Funding Cycles and Available AHP 
Subsidies 

Section 960.6(a)(1) of the proposed rule requires each Bank to 
establish at least two but no more than four AHP funding cycles 
per year during which applications for AHP subsidized advances or 
direct subsidies will be accepted. This is a change from the 
Board's existing AHP regulation, which provides that the Banks may 
accept AHP applications during two of four quarterly periods each 
year. See 12 CFR 960.4(a). 

Section 960.6(a)(1) of the proposed rule also provides that the 
AHP funding cycle schedule, including application due dates, is to 
be determined by the Bank in its discretion, but shall allow for 
sufficient time intervals to ensure an adequate pool of applicants 
to compete in each funding cycle. The funding cycles schedule, 
including application due dates, shall be described in detail in 
the Bank's AHP implementation plan. This is also a change from 
the Board's existing AHP regulation, which sets forth specific 
application due dates. See 12 CFR 960.4(a). 

Section 960.6(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that each 
Bank shall inform the general public and its members of the number 
and dates of its AHP funding cycles for the year and the 
approximate amount of available AHP subsidies for each funding 
cycle at least 45 calendar days before the due date for AHP 
applications for the first funding cycle for the year. This is a 
change from the Board's existing AHP regulation, which requires 
each Bank to announce its funding cycles by December 1 of the 
preceding year, and to notify only its members of the approximate 
amount of AHP subsidies to be offered in each funding cycle. See 
12 CFR 960.4(a), (b).

Consistent with  960.4(b) of the Board's existing AHP 
regulation,  960.6(b) of the proposed rule provides that each 
Bank shall allocate comparable amounts of AHP subsidies for each 
AHP funding cycle during the year. See 12 CFR 960.4(b). 



E. Specific Application and Scoring Requirements 



1. Application Requirements 



The proposed rule does not mandate use of a uniform AHP 
application form by all of the Banks. Rather, the Board believes 
that, consistent with current practice under the AHP, each Bank 
should continue to devise its own AHP application form, because 
each Bank will have its own special information requirements as a 
result of the specific priorities and scoring criteria adopted by 
the Bank. 

However, as discussed further below, all AHP applications must 
satisfy certain threshold requirements in order to be considered 
for scoring under the proposed rule. Thus, certain information 
from applicants must be received by all Banks in order for the 
Banks to be able to determine whether the applications satisfy the 
threshold requirements in the proposed rule and to score the 
applications under the scoring criteria. Accordingly,  960.7(a) 
of the proposed rule provides that each Bank shall require 
applicants for subsidized advances or direct subsidies under the 
AHP to submit to the Bank an application which, at a minimum, 
contains all of the information described below and any other 
information which the Bank determines is necessary in order to 
take action on such application, including the following: 

(1) A concise description of the purpose of the request and 
proposed uses of the funds, and its relationship to the priorities 
identified in proposed  960.10(d), the targeting criterion 
identified in proposed  960.10(e), and the other objectives 
identified in proposed  960.10(f); 

(2) A statement of how the project will satisfy the authorized 
uses and long-term requirements, including a description of legal 
mechanisms to be used to ensure compliance by the project with 
such requirements, contained in proposed   960.3 and 960.5; 

(3) A statement of how the project will comply with the fair 
housing law requirement contained in proposed  960.9(b); 

(4) A statement of how the project will satisfy the feasibility 
requirement contained in proposed  960.9(d); 

(5) A statement of how the project's sponsor satisfies the 
qualification requirement contained in proposed  960.9(e); 

(6) A statement of whether a subsidized advance or direct 
subsidy has been requested and the amount of such funds requested;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00061 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(7) A disclosure of whether or not the applicant has a direct 
or indirect interest in the property or project. If the applicant 
has an interest in the property and the application is approved, 
then prior to the transfer of AHP funds to the project, an 
independent current appraisal of the fair market value of such 
property must be provided, unless the applicant demonstrates that 
the property is being sold or otherwise transferred to the sponsor 
at a price substantially below the fair market value; 
(8) A statement of the project's costs; and 
(9) A certification from the applicant's, the sponsor's and the 
loan fund's or loan consortium's board of directors, or president 
or senior officer if so delegated by the board of directors, that 
the applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or loan consortium 
will comply with all requirements of this part and all obligations 
committed to in the AHP application. 

Section 960.4(c) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also 
generally requires an applicant to include in its AHP application 
the information identified in paragraphs (3) through (6) above, as 
well as any other information the Bank may require. See 12 CFR 
960.4(c). 
Section 960.4(c)(6) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also 
requires an applicant to disclose in its AHP application any 
direct or indirect interest of the applicant in the property or project. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(6). Under  960.7(a)(7)
of the 
proposed rule, if such an interest exists and the application is 
approved, then prior to the transfer of AHP funds to the project, 
the applicant generally is required to provide an appraisal of the 
property or project. This is to ensure that the sales price of 
such property or project owned by the applicant has not been 
inflated and that the applicant is not receiving the benefit of 
the AHP subsidy. 
Section 960.4(c)(7) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
requires the applicant to include in its AHP application an 
explanation of how the applicant intends to monitor the use of any 
funds received under the AHP, including an explanation of how the 
structure of the project ensures that a preponderance of the 
subsidy is ultimately received by the targeted beneficiaries. See 
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(D); 12 CFR 960.4(c)(7). As discussed in 
greater detail in the monitoring section below, as long as 
adequate monitoring is otherwise provided for, the proposed rule 
does not require the applicant in all instances to monitor the 
AHP-assisted project for compliance with the long-term requirement 
of the proposed rule. Accordingly, this provision of the existing 
regulation is deleted in the proposed rule. 
Section 960.4(c)(8) of the Board's existing AHP regulation 
requires the applicant to certify that the maximum subsidy 
limitation requirements of the AHP rule will not be violated. See 
12 CFR 960.4(c)(8). However, since the maximum subsidy limitation 
requirements are threshold requirements that all AHP applications 
must satisfy (see discussion below of the 20 percent requirement), 
this requirement is incorporated into proposed  960.7(a)(9), 
which provides generally that the applicant and sponsor must 
certify that all requirements of the AHP regulation will be 
satisfied. 
Section 960.4(c)(8) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also 
requires the applicant to explain in its AHP application how any 
AHP subsidy that exceeds the maximum subsidy requirements will be 
recaptured. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(8). Since AHP applications must 
satisfy the threshold maximum subsidy limitation requirements at 
the outset in order to be scored and approved for AHP funding, 
this issue does not arise and therefore has been deleted in the 
proposed rule. 
As discussed above, the requirement in  960.4(c)(9) of the 
Board's existing AHP regulation that the applicant's managing 
officer must certify that the AHP subsidy shall be only for 
authorized uses is expanded in proposed  960.7(a)(9) to require a 
certification by the applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or 
loan consortium not only that funds received under the AHP will be 
used for authorized uses, but also a certification of compliance 
with all requirements of the AHP regulation and all obligations 
committed to in the AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(9). In 
addition, the proposed rule requires the applicant, the sponsor 
and the loan fund or loan consortium, not just the applicant, as 
in the Board's existing AHP regulation, to make the certification 
in the AHP application. This change is proposed because the 
applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or loan consortium are 
all subject to specific requirements under the AHP and therefore 
should be required to certify that they will comply with such 
requirements. 



2. Action on Applications 


As discussed above, the proposed rule makes a major change in 
the Board's existing AHP regulation by taking the Board out of the 
approval process for AHP applications. Section 960.7(b)(1) of the 
proposed rule provides that each Bank shall review, score and take 
action on an AHP application pursuant to the requirements 
contained in proposed   960.8, 960.9 and 960.10, and shall notify 
the applicant of such action no later than 60 calendar days after 
the application due date for the AHP funding cycle. Section 
960.5(f)(1) of the existing regulation requires the Banks to 
forward to the Board their recommended applications no later than 
30 days after each offering deadline. See 12 CFR 960.5(f)(1). 
Since the Banks would have greater responsibilities in the 
approval process under the proposed rule, the 30-day period is 
proposed to be extended to 60 calendar days. 
Section 960.7(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides specifically 
that the board of directors of each Bank shall have the authority 
to approve or disapprove AHP applications received, and may 
delegate such authority to the president or other senior officers 
of the Bank.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 960.7(b)(3) of the proposed rule provides that within 
30 calendar days of each Bank's approval of the AHP applications 
for a given AHP funding cycle, the Bank shall forward to the Board 
a summary of each approved AHP application. The summary shall: 
(i) Briefly describe the project, including the applicant, the 
loan fund or loan consortium, if applicable, and the sponsor_
whether nonprofit, for-profit or public agency, the type of 
housing, the location, the long-term period committed to, the 
number of housing units including the number of units affordable 
for very low-, low- or moderate-income households or for 
households at any other income levels committed to in the AHP 
application, the development cost, other financing sources, and 
special needs populations served; 

(ii) State the reason for the points awarded under each of the 
Bank's scoring criteria for the project; 

(iii) Indicate whether a subsidized advance or direct subsidy 
was approved by the Bank for the project, the use of such funds, 
and the amount of such funds approved; if a subsidized advance was 
approved, the summary shall indicate the amount of the advance, 
the advance rate, the amortization schedule for the advance, the 
term to maturity, the applicable cost of funds, and the date as of 
which the cost of funds was determined; 

(iv) Indicate whether the project received approval in a prior 
AHP funding cycle, or whether the project is an extension, 
expansion, continuation or reconfiguration of a previously 
approved AHP project; 
(v) Describe how the project will be monitored and by what 
entity; 

(vi) Describe the legal mechanisms to be used to ensure 
compliance by the project with the long-term requirement contained 
in  960.5 of the proposed rule; 

(vii) Include a summary in chart form showing all AHP 
applications received by the Bank in the particular AHP funding 
cycle, with the score each application received for each scoring 
criterion, and the total score received by each project; and 

(viii) Include any other information required by the Board. 

The Board has general oversight responsibility over the AHP 
under section 10(j) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). In 
addition, section 10(j)(12)(A) of the Act requires the Board to 
monitor and report annually to the Congress and the Advisory 
Council for each Bank the support of low-income housing and 
community development by the Banks and the utilization of advances 
for these purposes. 

Id. 

 1430(j)(12)(A). Since the Board would 
no longer be receiving and approving AHP applications under the 
proposed rule, the Board would no longer have these applications 
as a source of data to assist the Board in exercising its 
oversight and monitoring responsibilities and preparing the annual 
report to the Congress and the Advisory Councils. Accordingly, 
the Board will need the Banks to provide this additional 
information to the Board in the summary, as required in proposed 
 960.7(b)(3). 


F. Requirements For Approval of AHP Applications 


1. General 



Section 960.8(a) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank 
shall evaluate the AHP applications received to determine if they 
satisfy the threshold criteria in proposed  960.9. All 
applications that meet the threshold criteria shall be scored 
pursuant to the criteria contained in proposed  960.10 as set 
forth in the Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. 

Section 960.8(b) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
shall approve the applications in descending order starting with 
the highest scoring application until the total AHP funding amount 
for the particular funding cycle, except for any amount 
insufficient to fund the next highest scoring project, has been 
allocated. The Bank also may approve the next four highest 
scoring applications as alternates and, within one year of 
approval by the Bank, may fund such alternates if any previously 
committed AHP funds become available. 



2. Threshold Criteria for Approval of AHP Applications 


Section 960.9 of the proposed rule provides that an AHP 
application must meet all of the threshold criteria set forth in 
a. through f. below in order to be considered for scoring under 
proposed  960.10 and for AHP funding approval. These criteria 
are discussed in detail below. 
a. 

Authorized and required uses requirements. 

The AHP 
application must indicate that the use of the subsidized advance 
or direct subsidy set forth in the AHP application for the 
proposed project will comply with the requirements for authorized 
and required uses of such funds contained in proposed   960.3, 
960.4 and 960.5. See proposed  960.9(a). 
This proposed provision is consistent with the intent of 
 960.5(a)(1) of the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR 
960.5(a)(1). 
b. 

Fair housing law requirements. 

The AHP application must 
indicate that the project sponsor will comply with any applicable 
fair housing law requirements and must indicate how the sponsor 
proposes to affirmatively further compliance with such 
requirements. See proposed  960.9(b). 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00063 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This proposed provision is consistent with the requirement of 
compliance with fair housing laws contained in  960.5(a)(2)(i) of 
the Board's existing AHP regulation, and the requirement under 
existing practice that applications indicate how the sponsor 
proposes to affirmatively further such compliance. See 12 CFR 
960.5(a)(2)(i). 

c. 

The twenty percent requirement and alternatives.

 
Section 960.9(c) of the proposed rule incorporates the existing 
maximum subsidy limitation requirement and alternatives contained 
in  960.9 of the Board's interim rule, with minor changes in 
language and one substantive modification discussed below. See 
12 CFR 960.9 (58 FR 17968 (April 7, 1993)). The 20 percent 
requirement and the alternatives discussed below implement the 
maximum subsidy limitation requirement contained in section 
10(j)(9)(F) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(F). Since the 
20 percent requirement or an alternative must be satisfied by all 
AHP applications to avoid over-subsidization of a project, it is 
set forth as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule. 

(i) The twenty percent requirement. 
Section 960.9(c)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides generally 
that a Bank shall not offer subsidized advances or direct 
subsidies to applicants in excess of that amount needed to reduce 
the monthly housing costs for income-eligible households, as 
committed to in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the 
household's gross monthly income (the 20 percent requirement). In 
projects where other forms of federal, state, local or private 
subsidized assistance are being used in conjunction with AHP 
subsidized advances or direct subsidies, the total amount of 
subsidized assistance, including funds provided under the AHP, 
shall not be in excess of the amount needed to reduce the monthly 
housing costs for the income-eligible households, as committed to 
in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the household's gross 
monthly income. 

Monthly housing costs are defined in proposed  960.9(c)(1)(ii) 
as: 

(1) For households in AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing 
units, mortgage principal and interest payments, real property 
taxes, homeowners' insurance, a reasonable estimate of utility 
costs excluding telephone service, and for households in 
AHP-assisted condominium, cooperative, mutual housing or other 
housing projects involving common ownership, those portions of any 
regular operating assessment or fee allocated for principal and 
interest payments, taxes, insurance and a reasonable estimate of 
utilities attributable to the household's share of the common area 
and/or the individual unit; and 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) For households in AHP-assisted rental housing units, rent 
payments, and where they are not already included in rent 
payments, a reasonable estimate of utility costs excluding 
telephone service. 

Section 960.9(c)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that a 
household subject to the 20 percent requirement is required to 
meet such requirement only at the time it initially purchases or 
occupies a unit. 

(ii) Alternative requirements. Section 960.9(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 20 percent requirement
shall not apply where a Bank provides subsidized advances or direct subsidies to an applicant for a 
rental housing project, which project also receives funds from a 
federal or state rental housing program that requires qualifying 
households to pay as rent a certain percentage of their monthly 
income or a designated amount, provided that the household meets 
the housing payment requirements of the other program. 

Section 960.9(c)(2)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
the 20 percent requirement shall not apply where the total amount 
of AHP funds provided through a Bank subsidized advance or direct 
subsidy used to finance rehabilitation of a housing unit by a very 
low-income household that already owns and occupies the housing 
unit is $10,000 or less per such household. In addition, proposed 
 960.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the 20 percent requirement 
shall not apply where the total amount of AHP funds provided 
through a Bank subsidized advance or direct subsidy used to 
finance the purchase of a housing unit by a very low-income 
household is $5,000 or less per such household. This is a change 
from the interim rule which permits this alternative to the 20 
percent requirement only for households that are above the 
threshold income level for very low-income households and at or 
below the income level to qualify as low- or moderate-income 
households. The Board did not intend to exclude very low-income 
households from taking advantage of this alternative when it 
adopted the interim rule. Accordingly, proposed 
 960.9(c)(2)(ii)(B) corrects this error. 

Section 960.9(c)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that the 
20 percent requirement shall not apply where the total amount of 
AHP funds provided through a Bank subsidized advance or direct 
subsidy used to finance rehabilitation or purchase of a housing 
unit by a low- or moderate-income household is $5,000 or less per 
such household. 

Section 960.9(c)(2)(iv) of the proposed rule provides that the 
20 percent requirement shall not apply where a Bank provides 
subsidized advances or direct subsidies ultimately benefiting a 
household with an income at or below the level committed to in the 
AHP application, which is participating in a self-help, sweat 
equity or similar housing program. Under the proposed rule, the 
household is required to contribute its skilled or unskilled labor 
valued at a minimum of $2,000 per household. The household must 
work cooperatively with others to construct or rehabilitate 
housing which the household or other program participants are 
purchasing or already own and occupy, and the program must involve 
supervision of the work performed by skilled builders or 
rehabilitators. 

d. 

Project feasibility

. The AHP application must indicate that the proposed project is feasible. This determination must be based on an analysis
of project sources and uses of funds, project multi-year operating 
pro formas for rental housing projects, projections of sales and 
prices for owner-occupied housing units, and local market 
conditions. The analysis must show that the project is 
financially viable and likely to be completed within a reasonable 
period of time, and is likely to operate or sell and remain 
affordable to the designated income-eligible households over the 
long-term period committed to in the AHP application. See 
proposed  960.9(d). 

A feasibility requirement also is contained in 
 960.5(a)(2)(ii) of the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 
12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(ii). 

e. 

Qualifications of sponsor.

 The AHP application must indicate that the sponsor has the qualifications and ability to perform its responsibilities
as committed to in the AHP application. See proposed  960.9(e). 

This proposed provision is not included as a threshold 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation, although it is 
required under the regulation to be included by an applicant in 
its AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(4). The Board believes 
that this provision should be included as a threshold requirement, 
since a project should not be funded if the sponsor lacks the 
qualifications and ability to undertake the project. 

f. 

Creditworthiness of applicant.

 Consistent with the Board's existing AHP regulation,  960.9(f) of the proposed rule provides that the applicant
must have the ability to qualify for an advance from the Bank to fund the project described in the AHP application. See
12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iii). 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Board's existing AHP regulation also includes as a 
threshold requirement the ability of the project to begin using 
Bank assistance within 12 months. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iv). 
Since this involves the use of funds after a project has been 
approved for funding, it does not belong as a threshold 
requirement and has been omitted in this section of the proposed 
rule. The requirements under the proposed rule for use of funds 
under the AHP within a reasonable period of time after approval of 
the application are discussed below in the use and verification 
section. 

Finally, it has been suggested that a threshold criterion 
should be added requiring that the project costs set forth in the 
AHP application are reasonable and appropriate for the type and 
location of the housing.

Section 10(j)(9)(F) of the Act requires the Board to establish 
maximum subsidy limitations under the AHP. 12 U.S.C. 
1430(j)(9)(F). Section 10(j)(9)(D) of the Act also requires the 
Board to ensure that a preponderance of assistance provided under 
the AHP is ultimately received by low- and moderate-income 
households. 

Id

. Section 1430(j)(9)(D). Requiring that project costs be 
reasonable is one way of controlling the amount of AHP subsidies 
that fund a project in order to keep the project from being 
over-subsidized, and to ensure that a preponderance of the funds 
are being received by the ultimate households by lowering their 
housing costs and not providing undue benefit to the 
intermediaries in the development process. 

A project costs requirement is not explicitly prescribed in the 
threshold requirements under the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
although some Banks do currently review project costs to determine 
if they are reasonable under the feasibility requirement in the 
existing regulation. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(ii). The feasibility 
requirement as defined in the proposed rule would not incorporate 
a project costs limit requirement. 

The Board specifically requests comments on how the Banks 
currently deal with applications with excessive project costs, 
whether the project costs option discussed above should be 
required as a threshold criterion in approving AHP applications, 
and how such a requirement could be implemented by the Banks. 



3. Scoring of AHP Applications 



Section 960.10(a) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
shall score AHP applications that satisfy all of the threshold 
criteria in proposed  960.9 according to the scoring methodology 
set forth in proposed  960.10, which shall be included in the 
Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. Section 960.10 of the 
proposed rule modifies the existing scoring methodology, and the 
Board specifically requests comments on this proposed new scoring 
methodology. 

a. 

Priority treatment and scoring. 

Section 960.10(b) of the proposed rule provides that each application is first evaluated to determine if it will receive
priority treatment. The Board's existing AHP regulation contains 
seven priorities: Homeownership projects; rental projects; 
projects using government properties; projects with a non-profit 
or public agency sponsor; projects promoting empowerment; homeless 
housing projects; and projects meeting a Bank priority. Under the 
existing AHP regulation, an application must meet at least three 
of the seven priorities to receive priority treatment. The 
proposed rule would contain only five priorities. The proposed 
rule would eliminate the priorities for homeownership and rental 
properties because a project must be either a rental or 
homeownership project in order to qualify for AHP funding. The 
proposed rule would replace the empowerment and homeless housing 
priorities with a priority for ``special needs'' housing. In 
addition, the proposed rule would add a new priority for projects 
promoting economic mobility. 

Under  960.10(b) of the proposed rule, for purposes of 
determining priority, an application can receive a maximum of 
eight points for each of the five priority categories described 
below. A Bank in its AHP implementation plan shall define more 
specifically each of the five priority categories and explain 
specifically how points will be awarded for satisfying each 
category. An application will be deemed to meet a particular 
priority category if it is awarded at least four points for that 
priority category. Applications meeting at least two priority 
categories shall receive priority treatment. 

Section 960.10(c) of the proposed rule provides that 
applications that qualify for such priority treatment shall be 
scored before applications that do not qualify for priority 
treatment. The applications that do not qualify for priority 
treatment will not be scored unless there are insufficient 
priority treatment applications to utilize the total AHP funding 
amount for the funding cycle. Under the proposed rule, the total 
points available for the priorities would be increased from 25 to 
40. Section 960.10(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
shall total the points received by each applicant for purposes of 
determining priority for all of the five priority categories and 
shall award 40 points to the application(s) that receive the 
highest number of total points, and the remaining application 
scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a declining scale 
basis. 

The five priority categories are set forth below. 

(1) Government-owned properties. Applications for projects that finance the purchase or rehabilitation of housing
owned or held by the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality of the United States, 
including but not limited to HUD, the RTC, Farmers Home Administration, Veterans Administration, Federal National
Mortgage Association, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. (See proposed  960.10(d)(1).)

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) 

Nonprofit or state or local government sponsored projects. 

Applications for projects that finance the purchase, 
construction or rehabilitation of housing sponsored by a nonprofit 
organization, a state or political subdivision of a state, a local 
housing authority or a state housing finance agency. (See 
proposed  960.10(d)(2).) 

(3) 

Special needs projects. 

Applications for projects that address special needs, which shall be defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation
plan, which special needs may include but are not limited to: 

(i) Empowering the households or residents through programs 
such as resident management of the property, self-help housing, 
homesteading, and sweat equity; 

(ii) Providing housing for special needs populations such as 
homeless persons, abused or battered persons, persons with AIDS, 
mentally or physically disabled persons, or persons with substance 
abuse problems; 

(iii) Providing housing in rural areas or areas targeted by 
local, state or federal governments for community development or 
revitalization through the development of affordable housing or 
economic investment; or 

(iv) Providing housing with special services to meet the needs 
of low- or moderate-income households including, but not limited 
to, child care, job training, medical care, substance abuse 
programs, independent living skill training, and rental household 
and homeowner household counseling. (See proposed 
 960.10(d)(3).) 

In defining the special needs priority in its AHP 
implementation plan, a Bank is not required to include all of the 
special needs listed as examples above. Rather, a Bank may be 
selective in giving priority to some special needs and not others 
in devising its scoring system. In addition, the Bank may select 
other special needs not listed as examples above if the special 
needs chosen are similar in nature to such examples. 

(4) District Bank priority. Applications for projects that meet one or more priorities recommended by the Bank's
Advisory Council and adopted by the 
Bank's board of directors that each address a housing need in the 
Bank's district and are consistent with the purposes of this part. 
The Bank shall describe in its AHP implementation plan how the 
points for the priority or priorities will be distributed. (See 
proposed  960.10(d)(4).) 

(5) Economic mobility priority. Applications for projects that provide housing for low- or moderate-income households
that move from low- or moderate-income neighborhoods or housing projects to neighborhoods, mixed-income buildings
or owner-occupied housing developments in which at least 
50 percent of the households have incomes above the median income 
for the area, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. (See proposed  960.10(d)(5).) 

b. 

Scoring for objectives. 

The Board's existing AHP regulation contains the following ``objectives'' scoring criteria: Targeting; long-term
retention; effectiveness; community involvement; community stability; and 
innovation. The proposed rule makes long-term retention a 
threshold criteria and adds a new objective called ``applicant 
participation.'' A description of this new objective and the other 
criteria are set forth below. 

c. 

Scoring for targeting objective. 

Section 960.10(e) of the proposed rule provides that an application can receive a maximum of 20 points for the targeting
objective category. This is an increase from 15 points under the existing regulation. The proposed rule provides
that the Bank 
shall award points to applications based on the extent to which 
the project(s) serve(s) the greatest percentage of very low-, low- 
and moderate-income households, in that priority order. In the 
alternative, if a weighted-average scoring methodology is provided 
in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, the Bank shall award points 
to an application based on the extent to which the project has the 
lowest weighted-average income determined by multiplying the 
percentage of units reserved for households at certain income 
levels by those incomes expressed as a percentage of median 
income, and adding the totals. Applications shall be scored 
relative to each other with the maximum number of points allowable 
awarded to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the targeting 
objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted 
and awarded points on a declining scale basis. However, 
owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and 
rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group.

d. 

Scoring for other objectives. 

Section 960.10(f) of the proposed rule sets forth five other objectives categories for scoring AHP applications.
The proposed rule requires the Bank in its AHP implementation plan to define more specifically each of the five other
objectives categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for satisfying each category. For each
category, the Bank shall award the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the application(s) that
best achieve(s) the objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a declining
scale basis. The five other objectives categories are set forth below. 
(1) AHP subsidy per unit. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award points
to applications based on the extent to which the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per AHP-subsidized
unit. Projects should be scored relative to each other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored
as one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group. This scoring criterion may not include
a leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on the percentage of the project's total development
cost that is to be financed with the AHP subsidy. This replaces the effectiveness criterion that can receive a maximum
of 15 points in the existing scoring methodology. 
(2) Applicant participation. An application can receive a maximum of five points for this category. The Bank shall
award points to applications based on the extent to which the project involves participation by applicants other
than the receipt of a subsidized advance or direct subsidy under the AHP. Such participation can be financial or non-financial,
including but not limited to debt or equity financing of the project, grants to the project, applicant involvement
on the boards of nonprofit sponsors, and applicant provision of technical assistance to the nonprofit sponsors for
the project. This is a new scoring criterion. 
(3) Community involvement. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award
points to applications based on the extent to which there is demonstrated support for the project by local community
organizations and individuals other than as project sponsors, such as through the commitment by such organizations
and individuals of funds, goods and services, and volunteer labor. The Banks should not award points for this category
based solely on the number of letters of support received for the project. 
(4) Community stability. An application can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall award
points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s) maximize(s) community stability, such as by: committing
to maintain a greater long-term period pursuant to  960.5; revitalizing vacant or abandoned properties or
being integrally part of a neighborhood stabilization plan, if such revitalization or stabilization is not identified
as a special needs category by the Bank pursuant to  960.10(d)(3)(iii); and not displacing low- or moderate-income
households, or if such displacement will occur, indicating how such households will be assisted to minimize the impact
of such displacement. 
(5) Innovation. An application can receive a maximum of five points for this category. This is a reduction from 10 points
under the existing regulation. The Bank shall award points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s)
involve(s) a particularly new or unusual approach, either financial or non-financial, for meeting the requirements
of this part. 


G. Modifications of Approved AHP Applications 


Section 960.11(a) of the proposed rule provides that an applicant that seeks a modification of an approved AHP application
before completion and occupancy of the project must submit a request for such modification in writing to the Bank for
review and approval. A modification is any change that affects or could potentially affect the material facts under
which the application was originally evaluated and scored. Modifications are changes in the specifics of an application
such as requests for additional AHP subsidy or changes in approved income targeting. 
Section 960.11(b) of the proposed rule provides that a request for a modification of an approved AHP application must
include, at a minimum:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00068 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. A description of how the proposed modification differs from the original application; 

2. The reason for the proposed modification; and 

3. Any other information that the Bank determines is necessary to review the proposed modification. 

Section 960.11(c)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall review the request for modification, shall
re-score the application as proposed to be modified according to the scoring criteria used in the AHP funding cycle
in which the application was originally approved, and may approve such request if the following factors are satisfied:

1. The project as proposed to be modified continues to meet all of the requirements of this part; and 

2. The project as proposed to be modified continues to score high enough that it would have been approved in its AHP funding
cycle. 
Section 960.11(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that if the application does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph
(c)(1), the Bank in its discretion may approve the request for modification if the reason for the modification is due
to circumstances outside the control of the applicant or sponsor. 
Section 960.11(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall forward to the Board a detailed summary of any modification
of an AHP application approved by the Bank, including how the Bank re-scored the project, within 30 calendar days of
the approval of such modification. 


H. Use, Calculation and Verification at Initial Disbursement of AHP Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies 


1. Use of Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies Within Reasonable Period of Time and Verification of Reasonable
Progress 


As discussed above, the threshold requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the project have the ability
to begin using Bank assistance within 12 months is omitted as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule. See 12 CFR
960.5(a)(2)(iv). In addition, setting a fixed period of 12 months may not be appropriate in all cases, because what
is a reasonable period of time will vary from project to project depending on the type of project and the circumstances
of the project. However, the Board does believe that funds received under the AHP should be used within a reasonable
period of time after approval of an AHP application. Because what is a reasonable period of time is so project specific,
the Board believes that the determination of such periods should be left to the discretion of the Banks. 
Accordingly,  960.12(a) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall in its AHP implementation plan identify
what constitutes reasonable progress by the sponsor towards using subsidized advances or direct subsidies within
a reasonable period of time after the approval of an AHP application for different types of projects, and explain how
it intends to verify such reasonable progress. 
Section 960.12(b) of the proposed rule provides that the sponsor must demonstrate that reasonable progress is being
made towards using the requested funds within a reasonable period of time after approval of the AHP application, as
determined by the Bank. 
Section 960.12(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall verify the efforts of the sponsor to determine
whether it has satisfied the requirement in paragraph (b). 
Section 960.12(d) of the proposed rule provides that if the sponsor fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph
(b), the Bank shall cancel the AHP award, and shall not disburse any subsidized advances or direct subsidies through
the applicant to the sponsor, and the full amount of any previously disbursed subsidized advances or direct subsidies
shall be returned to the Bank.

2. Calculation of AHP Subsidy 


The Board is considering adopting rules on the calculation of 
AHP subsidies for subsidized advances and specifically requests 
comments on the following proposals. Under consideration is 
whether AHP application approvals should commit to provide a 
dollar amount of subsidy, or should commit to make a subsidized 
advance at a specific interest rate. Another possibility is that 
the Bank can select on a case-by-case basis to do one or the other 
or both but the choice must be specified in its approval. The 
rule could require the Bank's AHP implementation plan to describe 
the Bank's procedures in this area. 
The Board specifically requests comments as to whether an AHP 
approval should commit to provide a specific dollar amount of 
subsidy for a subsidized advance. If interest rates rise after 
the approval, should the interest rate on the subsidized advance 
be increased so that the present value of the amount needed to 
subsidize the reduction in interest rate is equal to the subsidy 
amount originally approved? Should the applicant be given the 
option of either reducing the principal amount of the loan and 
keeping the originally requested interest rate unchanged, or 
increasing the interest rate on the loan and keeping the principal 
amount of the loan unchanged? If interest rates fall after the 
approval, should the specific dollar amount of approved subsidy 
stay the same, or be adjusted? 

Alternatively, if the AHP approval commits to make a subsidized 
loan at a specified interest rate, then a number of issues are 
raised. First, should the amount of the subsidy to be charged 
against the AHP fund be calculated at the time the application is 
approved, or at the time of disbursement. If the calculation is 
not done at the time the application is approved but is done at 
the time of funding and interest rates have fallen since the 
approval, the amount of the subsidy provided to subsidize the 
advance would decrease and the amount of subsidy charged against 
the AHP fund would decrease. If the calculation is done at the 
time of funding and interest rates have risen since the approval, 
the amount of the subsidy provided to subsidize the advance would 
increase and the amount of subsidy charged against the AHP fund 
would increase. If the increase in subsidy is permitted to be 
charged against the AHP fund, should there be any limits on the 
amount of increase in subsidy? If the amount that could be 
charged against the AHP fund could be increased without limit, 
these charges could reduce the amount of funds available for 
future cycles of AHP funding. One option would be to put an upper 
limit, for example a specified number of basis points, as the 
maximum amount by which additional AHP funds would be provided to 
cover the interest rate increase. Another option would be to 
approve the amount of the subsidy as well as the interest rate on 
the advance at the time the advance is approved and permit the 
subsidy to be increased up to a specified amount. Another issue 
is whether funds from future AHP funding cycles should be used to 

pay for increased subsidies due to interest rate increases. The 
Board specifically requests comments on these options. 
The Board is concerned about the calculation of subsidies where 
non-amortizing subsidized advances are used by members to fund 
amortizing AHP loans from members to sponsors. Since principal is 
repaid on a different schedule for amortizing loans than 
non-amortizing loans, the Banks must adjust their subsidy 
calculation methodologies to ensure that they have properly 
adjusted for these differences. As AHP principal is repaid to a 
member but not repaid to the Bank, the benefit of these subsidized 
funds may not be passed on to the ultimate borrower, as required 
in section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). 
Without proper adjustment for differences in the cash flows for an 
amortizing loan and an interest-only advance, the amount of 
subsidy actually received by a project will be less than the 
amount incurred by the Bank as an AHP expense. The Board 
specifically requests comments as to whether an amortizing advance 
structure is required to assure that the subsidy amount incurred 
by the Bank as an AHP expense matches the amount of the subsidy 
actually received by a sponsor. In addition, the Board requests 
comments as to whether there are alternative appropriate methods 
to deal with the discrepancy in the subsidy amounts where such 
advances are used to fund amortizing loans. 


3. Verification at Initial Disbursement of Subsidized 
Advances or Direct Subsidies

Section 960.13 of the proposed rule provides that at the time 
of initial disbursement of a subsidized advance or a direct 
subsidy by a Bank for an approved AHP application, the Bank shall 
verify in writing that the project complies with all applicable 
requirements contained in proposed  960.9 and all obligations 
committed to in the approved AHP application. The Bank shall 
verify the amount of subsidy being provided in connection with the 
application and being charged against the AHP fund. The Bank 
shall include in its AHP implementation plan its verification 
procedures for such purposes. 


I. Monitoring Requirements 


Section 960.14 of the proposed rule sets forth the requirements 
for monitoring AHP-assisted housing projects. Section 960.14 is 
intended to implement the statutory requirement of section 
10(j)(9)(C) of the Act, which provides that the Board's 
regulations shall ensure that advances made under the AHP be used 
only to assist projects for which adequate long-term monitoring is 
available. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(C). 
The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that each Bank 
must monitor housing projects funded through its AHP. See 12 CFR 
960.7(b). Section 960.14(a) of the proposed rule carries forward 
this requirement, and  960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule 
sets forth the specific monitoring requirements for the Banks, 
which are discussed further below. Section 960.14(b) of the 
proposed rule provides that each Bank shall include in its AHP 
implementation plan an explanation of how it intends to meet the 
monitoring requirements of  960.14 of the proposed rule. 
Under  960.14(c) of the proposed rule, a Bank may contract 
with an applicant, a state housing finance agency, or another 
entity to perform the tasks required to carry out the Bank's 
monitoring responsibilities; however, the Bank remains ultimately 
responsible for meeting the monitoring requirements set forth in 
 960.14 (e) through (h) of the proposed rule. Thus, a Bank may 
decide in its monitoring plan that applicants will have no 
long-term monitoring responsibilities. Alternatively, the Bank 
may decide to require applicants to perform long-term monitoring 
as a condition of approval of an AHP award, or the Bank may 
determine what entity has the responsibility for monitoring on a 
project-by-project basis. 


1. Applicant Monitoring of Construction or Rehabilitation 


Section 960.14(d) of the proposed rule adds a new requirement 
that if a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is used to finance 
construction or rehabilitation of a project, the Bank shall 
require the applicant to monitor the construction or 
rehabilitation until completion, and to make progress reports to 
the Bank. Where an applicant finances construction or 
rehabilitation, the applicant usually monitors the progress of the 
project in connection with approving disbursements of funds to the 
borrower. Therefore, the Board believes that where an applicant 
uses a subsidized advance or direct subsidy to make loans for 
construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted project, the 
applicant is in the best position to monitor the progress of such 
construction or rehabilitation and to make progress reports to the 
Bank. 



2. Bank Monitoring Requirements 



Section 960.14 (e) through (h) of the proposed rule sets forth 
the specific aspects of an AHP project that a Bank is required to 
monitor. Section 960.14(e) of the proposed rule sets for the 
monitoring responsibilities that are long-term in nature, as 
required by section 10(j)(9)(C) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 
1430(j)(9)(C). Section 960.14(f) and (h) of the proposed rule 
sets forth the short-term monitoring responsibilities for 
compliance with the special needs and economic mobility 
priorities. Section 960.14(g) sets forth the monitoring 
responsibilities for the District Bank priority or priorities, 
which may or may not be long-term, depending on the nature of the 
priority selected by the Bank. 
a. 

Monitoring of long-term requirements. 


Section 960.14(e) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
requirements for monitoring the long-term requirements for 
owner-occupied and rental housing projects assisted under the AHP. 

(i) Owner-occupied housing units. 
Section 960.14(e)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides that at 
the time a household enters into a purchase contract for an 
AHP-assisted housing unit or by the closing on the financing for 
such unit, or at the time a household that already owns the 
housing unit receives a commitment of a loan or a grant pursuant 
to the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification 
from the sponsor that the household has an income at or below the 
level committed to in the AHP application.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00071 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
during the required long-term period applicable to an 
owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under the 
AHP, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the unit to determine 
whether it has been sold to a household with an income that 
exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application. 
The Board requests comments on two proposed options for 
implementing this requirement. These options incorporate the use 
of sampling to monitor AHP-assisted projects. The Board 
recognizes that as the number of AHP-assisted projects in 
existence grows, the costs of monitoring these projects may place 
an undue financial burden on the Banks and the AHP. Monitoring 
AHP-assisted projects on a sample basis may be one way to minimize 
the costs of monitoring while continuing to meet the monitoring 
requirements of the Act. 
Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that 
monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review 
of relevant reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor, 
including any reports or certifications received pursuant to 
 960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule and, at least on a sample 
basis, periodic review of land title records at intervals 
determined by the Bank, based on the amount of funds received by 
the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the 
project, or other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. 
An alternative option would be to require that the Bank only 
would have to review land title records on a sample basis, as 
determined by the Bank. 
(ii) Rental housing projects. 
Section 960.14(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Bank shall require an AHP-assisted rental housing project to be 
subject to a deed restriction or other legally enforceable 
mechanism which requires that upon sale of the project prior to 
the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental 
units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied 
by households with incomes at or below the level committed to in 
the AHP application, the Bank or its designee must receive notice 
of the sale, and: 
(1) The project's rental units, or portion thereof, must 
continue to be affordable for and occupied by households with 
incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application 
for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP 
application, and the purchaser agrees to be subject to the same 
restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or 
(2) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1) 
above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant 
which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the seller must 
repay a pro rata portion of the grant to the applicant, as 
provided in  960.16(d)(1) of the proposed rule; or 
(3) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1) 
above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the 
applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan to the 
seller, then the provisions of  960.16(d)(2) shall apply. 
Section 960.14(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that 
upon initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental 
housing project or one year after initial disbursement of the 
subsidized advance or direct subsidy, whichever occurs first, the 
Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor 
or the owner that the project's units, or portion thereof, are 
affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at initial 
occupancy at or below the levels committed to in the AHP 
application. 
Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
during the long-term period for which the units, or portion 
thereof, of a rental housing project must remain affordable for 
and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee 
shall monitor the project to determine whether the project's 
units, or portion thereof, remain affordable for and occupied by 
households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the 
AHP application. The Board requests comments on several options 
for implementing this requirement. 
Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that 
monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review 
of relevant household income and rent reports or certifications 
obtained from the sponsor or the owner and, at least on a sample 
basis, periodic inspections of the project at intervals to be 
determined by the Bank, based on the amount of AHP assistance 
received by the project, the type and complexity of the project, 
and other factors deemed relevant by the Bank.

<TEXT>
 

Another option would be that where funds other than funds 
provided under the AHP are the predominant source of financing for 
an AHP-assisted rental housing project and the monitoring 
activities of such other funding source are sufficient to 
determine the project's compliance with the requirements of the 
AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, the monitoring 
requirement would be deemed to be fulfilled. However, if the 
monitoring activities of such other funding source are not 
sufficient to determine the project's compliance with the 
requirements of the AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, 
the Bank would be required to monitor the project by conducting 
inspections, at least on a sample basis, as determined by the 
Bank, based on the amount of the funds received by the project 
under the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or other 
factors deemed relevant by the Bank. In the alternative, if the 
monitoring activities of such other funding source are not 
sufficient to determine the project's compliance with the 
requirements of the AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, 
could the Bank rely on monitoring activities of the predominant 
funding source as long as it is monitoring for compliance with 
requirements that are substantially similar to the AHP 
requirements? 

The Board specifically requests comments on how random sampling 
could be used to monitor AHP-assisted rental housing projects to 
determine whether, during the long-term period committed to in the 
AHP application, the project's units continue to be affordable for 
and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application. For example, sampling could 
involve monitoring a portion of AHP-assisted rental projects at 
fixed intervals. The sampling method could be devised so that 
each project is monitored at least once during the long-term 
period committed to in the AHP application. Alternatively, the 
sampling method might be structured so that some, but not all, 
AHP-assisted rental projects are monitored during the long-term 
period committed to in the AHP application. 

The Act requires that the AHP regulation must ensure that the 
AHP will be used only to assist projects for which adequate 
long-term monitoring is available to guarantee that affordability 
standards and other requirements of the Act are satisfied. See 
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(C). The Board requests comments as to 
whether it is appropriate to interpret this requirement in a 
manner that permits monitoring to be done by sampling that could 
result in some AHP-assisted rental projects not being monitored 
during the long-term period committed to in the AHP application. 
In addition, the Board specifically requests comments on whether 
there are sampling techniques that would ensure that each project 
is monitored in satisfaction of the monitoring requirement in the 
Act. 

b. 

Monitoring of special needs projects.

 
Section 960.14(f) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
requirements for monitoring a project that commits to meet a 
special need pursuant to proposed  960.10(d)(3), either through 
providing units for persons with a special need or through 
providing a special service to occupants, as defined in the Bank's 
AHP implementation plan. If an applicant commits to fund a 
project that provides owner-occupied or rental housing units for 
persons with a special need, as defined in the Bank's AHP 
implementation plan,  960.14(f)(1) of the proposed rule requires 
the Bank or its designee to obtain a certification from the 
sponsor or the owner upon completion and occupancy of the project 
that the project's units, or portion thereof, are occupied by 
persons with such special need. 

If an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a 
project that will provide a continuing special service to its 
occupants, as defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, such 
as child care, job training, medical care, or other services 
designed to meet the special needs of occupants, then 
 960.14(f)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank or its 
designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor or owner 
upon completion and occupancy of the project that the special 
service is being provided to the occupants, as committed to in the 
AHP application. 

Section 960.14(f)(2) of the proposed rule provides that, where 
an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing 
project that will provide a continuing special service, the Bank 
or its designee shall monitor the project, as determined by the 
Bank in its AHP implementation plan, for at least one year from 
the date of initial full occupancy of the project to verify that 
the special service continues to be provided to the occupants, as 
committed to in the AHP application.

c. 

Monitoring of District Bank priority or priorities.

 
Section 960.14(g) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
requirement for monitoring compliance with the District Bank 
priority or priorities established pursuant to proposed 
 960.10(d)(4). Section 960.14(g)(1) of the proposed rule 
provides that if an applicant in its AHP application commits to 
fund a project that meets a District Bank priority or priorities, 
the Bank or its designee shall monitor the project to verify that 
it continues to meet the priority or priorities. Section 
960.14(g)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall set 
forth in its AHP implementation plan the nature, frequency and 
duration for monitoring compliance with the District Bank priority 
or priorities. 

d. 

Monitoring of economic mobility priority.

 
Section 960.14(h) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
requirement for monitoring compliance with the economic mobility 
priority set forth under  960.5(d)(5) of the proposed rule. 
Section 960.14(h) provides that if an applicant in its AHP 
application commits to fund a project that meets the requirements 
of  960.5(d)(5), the Bank or its designee shall obtain a 
certification from the sponsor or the owner upon completion and 
full occupancy of the project, as required under  960.15(c)(4), 
that the sponsor or the owner has met such requirements, as 
committed to in the AHP application. 



J. Reporting Requirements 



Section 960.15 of the proposed rule sets forth the reporting 
requirements for the Banks, the applicants, and the sponsors or 
owners of AHP-assisted projects. Section 960.15(a) of the 
proposed rule provides that each Bank shall provide accurate and 
timely reports and documentation to, and in the format requested 
by, the Board concerning the Bank's AHP, as the Board may from 
time to time require. See 12 CFR 960.6(a). 



1. Applicant Reporting Requirements 



Section 960.15(b)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank 
shall require an applicant receiving a subsidized advance or 
direct subsidy to report at least annually to the Bank on the 
manner in which it has used the funds, with such reports 
continuing until the funds have been fully disbursed by the 
applicant. See 12 CFR 960.6(b). 

The proposed rule eliminates the requirement in the Board's 
existing AHP regulation that the applicant certify that the AHP 
subsidy has been passed through to the borrower and continues to 
be used for approved purposes because, as discussed previously in 
the section on monitoring requirements, under the proposed rule 
applicants are not required to monitor the use of a subsidy in 
AHP-assisted projects, except during the period when a subsidized 
advance or direct subsidy is used to finance construction or 
rehabilitation of a project or where the applicant has agreed to 
undertake monitoring. See 12 CFR 960.6(c). 

Section 960.15(b)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new 
requirement that if subsidized advances or direct subsidies are 
used to finance construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted 
project, the Bank shall require the applicant to report to the 
Bank at reasonable intervals determined by the Bank, and described 
in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, on the progress of the 
construction or rehabilitation, until completion. This reporting 
requirement coincides with the requirement in  960.14(d) of the 
proposed rule that the Bank shall require the applicant to monitor 
the construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted project and 
make progress reports to the Bank where AHP subsidized advances or 
direct subsidies are used to finance such construction or 
rehabilitation. 



2. Sponsor and Owner Reporting Requirements 



Section 960.15(c) of the proposed rule sets forth the reporting 
requirements for sponsors and owners. These requirements coincide 
with the monitoring requirements set forth in  960.14(e) through 
(h) of the proposed rule. Section 960.15(c)(1)(i) of the proposed 
rule provides that where a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is 
used to finance the purchase of an owner-occupied housing unit, 
the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the time a 
household enters into a purchase contract for such unit or at the 
closing on the financing for such unit that the unit has been sold 
to a household with an income at or below the level committed to 
in the AHP application. Where a subsidized advance or direct 
subsidy is used to finance the rehabilitation of an owner-occupied 
housing unit, the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the 
time a loan or grant is committed to fund such rehabilitation that 
the household that owns and occupies the unit has an income at or 
below the level committed to in the AHP application. 

Section 960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that if 
an owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under 
the AHP is not subject to a deed restriction or other legally 
enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of ownership to a 
household with an income at or below the level committed to in the 
AHP application, the Bank shall require the sponsor to report to 
the Bank or its designee, at least annually for the required 
long-term period, the number of any such units that are sold to 
households whose incomes exceed the level committed to in the AHP 
application, and to certify to the Bank that it is continuing to 
satisfy its commitment pursuant to its legally binding agreement 
with the Bank. 

Section 960.15(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Bank shall require the sponsor or the owner to certify upon 
initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental 
housing project, but no later than one year after initial 
disbursement of the subsidized advance or direct subsidy, and 
annually thereafter, that the project's units, or portion thereof, 
are affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or 
below the levels committed to in the AHP application. 

Section 960.15(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a project that 
will provide housing units for persons with a special need, or 
will provide a continuing special service to occupants pursuant to 
 960.10(d)(3) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require the 
sponsor or the owner to certify upon completion and full occupancy 
of the project that the project's units, or portion thereof, are 
occupied by persons with such special needs or that a special 
service is being provided to occupants, as committed to in the AHP 
application. 

Section 960.15(c)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if an 
applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing project 
that meets the requirements of the economic mobility priority 
under  960.10(d)(5) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require 
the sponsor or the owner to certify upon completion and full 
occupancy of the project that the sponsor or owner has met such 
requirements, as committed to in the AHP application.

Section 960.15(d) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank 
shall require applicants or sponsors to provide such other reports 
to the Bank, in addition to the reports and documentation required 
by  960.15 of the proposed rule, as the Bank deems necessary in 
order to fulfill its monitoring obligations under  960.14 of the 
proposed rule. 


K. Corrective and Remedial Actions for Fraud or Non-Compliance 
With AHP Requirements 



Section 10(j) of the Act is silent on what specific corrective 
and remedial actions should be imposed when there is fraud or 
non-compliance with the requirements of the AHP. See 12 U.S.C. 
1430(j). Accordingly, the Board has the discretion to determine, 
as a matter of policy, what those requirements should be. 

The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that, where funds 
provided under the AHP will not be or are no longer being used for 
their approved purposes, the amount of committed but unused 
subsidy or improperly used subsidy shall be recovered and made 
available by the Bank for future AHP projects. See 12 CFR 
960.8(a). The existing regulation requires the Bank, in 
recapturing such funds, to take any or all of the following 
actions, without limitation on other remedies, in its discretion: 

a. Reprice the advance at the interest rate charged to members 
on non-subsidized advances of comparable type and maturity at the 
time of the original advance; 
b. Call the advance; 
c. Assess a prepayment fee; or 
d. Require the member to reimburse the Bank for the amount of 
the unused or improperly used subsidy on the advance or other 
assistance. 



Id. 

 960.8(b). In addition, some Banks have adopted procedures 
that require a direct subsidy to be converted to an advance if the 
project is found to be in non-compliance with the requirements of 
the AHP regulation. 

A number of concerns have been raised about this recapture 
requirement. First, it may not be equitable to require the 
applicant to reimburse the Bank when it is the sponsor that is in 
non-compliance with the AHP requirements. Second, requiring 
recapture of the AHP subsidy could in some situations result in 
the applicant having to foreclose against a property in order to 
recover the funds to repay an advance to the Bank, thereby 
eliminating affordable housing units even when only a few of the 
units in the project may be out of compliance with AHP 
requirements. 

In short, it has become clear through the operation of the AHP 
that the recapture remedy may not be the appropriate remedial 
action in all circumstances. Other less severe remedial actions 
may be more appropriate depending on the nature of the 
non-compliance that has occurred. In addition, the remedial 
actions should be directed only at the parties that are in 
non-compliance. Accordingly, the proposed rule contains 
provisions that tailor the remedial actions required to the nature 
of the non-compliance and the party committing the non-compliance, 
which are discussed further below. 



1. Fraud or Willful Non-Compliance 



Fraud and willful non-compliance are the most extreme examples 
of non-compliance with the AHP requirements. Accordingly, the 
proposed rule applies the most severe remedial actions_
exclusion or suspension from future participation in the AHP and 
recovery of the full amount of the AHP subsidy_to parties that 
have committed fraud or are in willful non-compliance with respect 
to the AHP requirements. 

Specifically,  960.16(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that 
in the event of an applicant's, sponsor's or owner's fraud with 
respect to the AHP requirements, the Bank shall exclude the 
applicant, sponsor or owner, respectively, on a permanent basis, 
from future participation in the AHP. In the event of an 
applicant's, sponsor's or owner's willful non-compliance with the 
AHP requirements, the Bank shall suspend the applicant, sponsor or 
owner, respectively, at least on a temporary basis, from future 
participation in the AHP during the period such willful 
non-compliance continues, and may exclude such party permanently 
from future participation in the AHP. The Board specifically 
requests comments as to whether the Banks should be able to 
determine whether fraud or willful non-compliance has occurred, or 
whether such determination should be made by the Board, or by 
either the Bank or the Board. 

In addition,  960.16(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that 
in the event of an applicant's fraud or willful non-compliance 
with respect to the AHP requirements, the Bank shall recover from 
the applicant the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the 
project. 

Section 960.16(a)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in 
the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful 
non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full 
amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the sponsor or 
owner by the applicant and returned to the Bank or, if previously 
agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the Bank from the 
sponsor or owner. If efforts to recover the AHP subsidy from the 
sponsor or owner are unsuccessful, the applicant shall not be 
liable for such funds. 

In order to be able to implement this recapture requirement, 
the applicant is required, under proposed  960.16(a)(3)(ii), to 
have in place either:

<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable 
mechanism that permits it to recover these funds from the sponsor 
or owner; or 

(2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally 
enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the 
sponsor or owner and the applicant that permits the Bank to 
recover these funds from the sponsor or owner. 

Section 960.16(a)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required 
remedial actions under this paragraph (a) upon written request by 
the Bank, applicant, sponsor or owner. 



2. Other Types of Non-Compliance 



Non-compliance by a party with the AHP requirements, such as 
due to inadvertent errors by such party or changes in 
circumstances that are outside such party's control, does not 
warrant imposition of the most severe remedial actions since the 
party lacked the intent to violate such requirements. In 
addition, in many such cases, the non-compliance can be rectified 
within a reasonable period of time. 

Accordingly,  960.16(b) of the proposed rule provides that in 
the event of inadvertent non-compliance by an applicant, sponsor 
or owner, the Bank shall provide such party with a reasonable 
period of time in which to take reasonable efforts, pursuant to a 
compliance plan approved by the Bank, to remedy the 
non-compliance. The Bank in its discretion may exclude such party 
from participation in the AHP while it is under a compliance plan, 
or in its discretion may require the applicant to increase the 
long-term period committed to in its AHP application for the 
project by the amount of time the project has been in 
non-compliance. 

Section 960.16(b) of the proposed rule further provides that if 
the applicant, sponsor or owner takes no reasonable efforts to 
comply with the compliance plan, then such party is in willful 
non-compliance with the requirements of this part and is subject 
to the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes reasonable 
efforts pursuant to the compliance plan to remedy the 
non-compliance under paragraph (b) and such efforts are 
unsuccessful, the applicant, sponsor or owner would be subject to 
the remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance, but may 
apply to the Bank for a waiver of any such required remedial 
actions. The Bank shall report to the Board in writing on any 
waivers approved pursuant to paragraph (b) within 30 calendar days 
of such approval. 



3. Sale of AHP-assisted Owner-Occupied Housing Unit to 
Income-Ineligible Household 





a. Recapture requirement.

 
Section 960.16(c) of the proposed rule provides generally that 
in the event that a household sells its AHP-assisted 
owner-occupied housing unit to a household whose income exceeds 
the level committed to in the AHP application prior to the end of 
the required long-term period, then: 

(i) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant 
which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall 
require the seller to repay a 

pro rata

 share, except for 

de 
minimis 

amounts, of the grant received by such seller. The amount 
to be repaid shall be reduced for every year the seller owned the 
unit, to be repaid from any net gain from the sale of the unit 
after deduction for sales expenses, and to be returned to the 
Bank. The proposed rule provides, however, that the Bank in its 
discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such 
requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by 
the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or 

(ii) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant 
and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, 
then the applicant shall either repay to the Bank that portion of 
the advance used to make the loan to the seller or the Bank shall 
convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the 
seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the 
market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any 
unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to 
subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the 
seller shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP 
projects. 

b. 

Exception to recapture requirement.

 
Section 960.16(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that the 
recapture requirements described above shall not apply provided 
the sponsor, pursuant to a legally binding agreement with the 
Bank, assists another household with an income at or below the 
level committed to in the AHP application in the manner originally 
committed to in the AHP application.

This alternative approach is discussed in greater detail above under the monitoring section. 


4. Sale of AHP-Assisted Rental Housing Project 


Section 960.16(d) of the proposed rule provides that in the event that the owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing
project sells the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or portion
thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in
the AHP application, and the purchaser does not agree to maintain the project according to such commitments and to
be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller, then: 
(i) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall
require the seller to repay a 

pro rata 

share, except for 

de minimis 

amounts, of the grant received by such seller, reduced for every year the seller owned the unit, to be repaid from any
net gain from the sale of the project after deduction for sales expenses, and to be returned to the Bank, except that
the Bank in its discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such requirement will cause undue hardship
on the seller, as defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or 
(ii) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant and the applicant provided a below market rate loan
to the seller, then the applicant shall either repay the advance to the Bank or the Bank shall convert the advance to
a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and
any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize the advance shall be made available by the Bank
for additional AHP projects. 


L. AHP Applications Involving Loan Funds and Loan Consortia 


Section 960.17 of the proposed rule sets forth specific requirements governing the use of loans and grants received
by loan funds and loan consortia pursuant to the AHP. The Board's existing AHP regulation does not address specifically
the use of loans or grants by loan funds or loan consortia pursuant to the AHP. See 12 CFR part 960. However, the Board
has adopted policy guidelines for the Banks governing the award of subsidized advances and direct subsidies to applicants
that then make loans or grants to loan funds and loan consortia (policy guidelines). See Board Resolution No. 93-54,
June 23, 1993. The provisions in  960.17 of the proposed rule, if adopted in final form by the Board, would incorporate
the policy guidelines, with some modifications. 
Section 960.17(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides generally that an applicant may use a subsidized advance or a direct
subsidy to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium. Section 960.17(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides
that AHP applications involving the use of loans or grants by loan funds or loan consortia are governed by the provisions
of part 960, except as provided in  960.17 of the proposed rule. 
Section 960.17(b) of the proposed rule provides that the requirements for approval of an AHP application that proposes
to use subsidized advances or direct subsidies to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium are the same
as the requirements for approval applicable to all other AHP applications under  960.8 of the proposed rule,
except that an AHP application that involves a loan fund or loan consortium will be scored on the criteria that the loan
fund or loan consortium proposes to use to select projects that will ultimately receive a loan or grant from the loan
fund or loan consortium that is subsidized by the AHP. 
This provision is intended to address the fact that loan funds and loan consortia do not have specific proposed projects
in place at the time they apply for funds under the AHP. Section 960.17(b)(1) of the proposed rule therefore requires
the Banks to score AHP applications involving loan funds or loan consortia based on the criteria that the loan fund
or loan consortium commits to use when selecting the projects it will fund. This provision carries forward a requirement
of the Board's existing policy guidelines. 
In addition,  960.17(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall review and shall require the applicant
to review each new rental housing project funded by a loan fund or loan consortium prior to disbursing a loan or grant
to ensure that the project meets the threshold requirements of  960.9 of the proposed rule and the project selection
criteria committed to in the approved AHP application. 
This is a change from the provision in the Board's existing policy guidelines that requires the Bank and the applicant
to review both rental and owner-occupied housing projects prior to funding by a loan fund or loan consortium under
the AHP. This change is intended to eliminate duplicative review of loan fund or loan consortium activities where
funds are used to finance owner-occupied housing units under the AHP. However, since rental housing projects are
more complex than owner-occupied housing projects, the Board believes that the applicant and the Bank should continue
to review each rental housing project funded by a loan fund or loan consortium prior to disbursement of any funds to
ensure that the project meets the feasibility, maximum subsidy, and other threshold requirements of  960.9
of the proposed rule. 
Section 960.17(c)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the requirement in the Board's existing policy guidelines
that if an applicant receives a subsidized advance and uses the proceeds of the advance to make a loan to a loan fund or
loan consortium, the total value of the interest rate subsidy must be passed on to the borrower of the funds. Thus,  960.17(c)(1)
provides that a loan fund or loan consortium shall extend credit to the borrower at a rate of interest equal to the rate
of interest charged on the subsidized advance plus a reasonable interest rate spread approved by the Bank. The applicant
and the loan fund or loan consortium may determine between themselves what proportion of the interest rate spread
the applicant and the loan fund or loan consortium will share. 
Section 960.17(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that a loan fund or loan consortium that receives a grant from
an applicant pursuant to the AHP must either:

<TEXT>
 

(A) Pass the entire grant on to the recipient; 
(B) Use the entire grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the borrower; or 
(C) Lend the entire grant to the borrower to finance a rental housing project for a term of not less than 30 years, with
all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such term. If such loan is repaid before the end of the
30-year term, the entire amount of the grant must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn must forward the funds to
the Bank to be used for additional AHP projects. 
This is a change from the provision in the Board's existing policy guidelines that prohibits a loan fund or loan consortium
from using a grant from an applicant to make a loan to the borrower. The Board believes that if a loan fund or loan consortium
lends a grant to a sponsor to finance rental housing units that will remain affordable for and occupied by income-eligible
households for not less than 30 years, with all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of the loan term,
then the loan fund or loan consortium has passed on the full amount of the AHP subsidy to the recipient or borrower of
the funds, as required by section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). However, if the borrower repays
the loan before maturity, the entire amount of the subsidy must be repaid to the applicant and forwarded by the applicant
to the Bank to be returned to the AHP fund. Therefore, a loan fund or loan consortium may use a grant under the AHP to make
a loan to the borrower under the conditions specified in  960.17(c)(2)(i)(C) of the proposed rule. 
Section 960.17(c)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that if a loan fund or loan consortium provides both a loan
and a grant to the borrower and the loan fund or loan consortium charges an origination fee for providing the loan, then
any fee charged by the loan fund or loan consortium for providing the grant may not be paid with AHP subsidized advances
or direct subsidies. The Board does not believe that such funds should be used to pay a fee for providing a grant to a project
if the loan fund or loan consortium charges a fee for underwriting a loan to the same project. 
Section 960.17(c)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that when a loan fund or loan consortium receives a grant
from an applicant pursuant to the AHP and uses the grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the borrower, the interest
rate calculation must be consistent with the procedure used by the Bank for calculating the amount of AHP subsidy needed
for a subsidized advance, taking into account the source of funds used by the loan fund or loan consortium for its loans
and the rate that normally would be charged for a loan of the type and term that is provided to the borrower.

Section 960.17(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that any 
interest or other income earned by a loan fund or loan consortium 
on a loan or a grant received from an applicant, other than any 
approved fee or interest rate spread charged to the borrower, 
either (i) must be used by the loan fund or loan consortium to 
provide funds for additional projects meeting the threshold 
requirements in  960.9 of the proposed rule and the criteria 
committed to in the approved AHP application, or (ii) must be 
forwarded to the applicant, which in turn must forward the funds 
to the Bank to be used for additional AHP projects. This is a 
change from the provision in the Board's existing policy 
guidelines that allows loan funds and loan consortia to earn and 
retain 

de minimis

 amounts of income on loans or grants received 
from applicants. The Board believes that accounting for 

de 
minimis

 amounts of interest or other income earned on loans or 
grants received from an applicant is no less of an administrative 
burden than accounting for all such interest or other income 
earned. Therefore, the proposed rule requires all interest or 
other income earned on loans or grants received from an applicant 
to be used by the loan fund or loan consortium for additional AHP 
projects or returned to the applicant. 

Section 960.17(c)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if 
loans or grants received by a loan fund or loan consortium 
pursuant to one AHP funding cycle are combined with loans or 
grants received by such entity pursuant to another AHP funding 
cycle in a single rental housing project, the loan fund or loan 
consortium shall require the recipient of the funds to follow the 
requirements for the use of such funds from the AHP funding cycle 
that is more restrictive as to the approved AHP criteria. This 
requirement does not apply when loans or grants received by a loan 
fund or loan consortium pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles 
are combined to finance a single owner-occupied housing project. 
The reason for this provision is that funds are more easily 
traceable to separate units in an owner-occupied housing project 
than to separate units in a rental housing project. Therefore, 
for purposes of owner-occupied housing projects, it is possible to 
use loans or grants from different AHP funding cycles according to 
the different criteria approved by the Bank in each of the 
respective funding cycles. However, the loan fund or loan 
consortium in its discretion may require the recipient of the 
funds to follow the requirements for the use of such funds from 
the AHP funding cycle that is more restrictive as to the approved 
AHP criteria. 

Section 960.17(c)(5) of the proposed rule provides that any 
loans provided by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to the 
AHP that are repaid to such entity must be re-lent or provided as 
grants by such entity within a reasonable period of time after 
such repayments, or must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn 
must repay such funds to the Bank, and must be made available by 
the Bank for additional AHP projects. The Bank shall in its AHP 
implementation plan identify what constitutes a reasonable period 
of time for such purposes. 

Section 960.17(d) of the proposed rule sets forth the 
monitoring and reporting requirements where an applicant makes 
loans or grants pursuant to the AHP to a loan fund or loan 
consortium which uses the funds to finance owner-occupied or 
rental housing units. Section 960.17(d)(1)(i) of the proposed 
rule requires the Bank to monitor such units, according to the 
monitoring requirements of  960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed 
rule, to determine compliance with the long-term requirements, as 
well as compliance with the special needs priority, the District 
Bank priority or priorities, and the economic mobility priority, 
where applicable. In addition,  960.17(d)(1)(ii) of the proposed 
rule provides that the Bank shall require the sponsor or owner of 
a project receiving a loan or grant from the loan fund or loan 
consortium to submit to the Bank such reports and certifications 
as are required under  960.15(c) of the proposed rule. Section 
960.17(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank 
shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the 
Bank any new loan or grant made using repayments of loans by the 
borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or 
grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, 
the use of such funds must be reported separately. 

Section 960.17(d)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Bank may contract with either the applicant or the loan fund or 
loan consortium to meet the monitoring requirements of  960.14(e) 
through (h). Under  960.17(d)(2)(i) of the proposed rule, if the 
Bank contracts with the applicant to meet such monitoring 
requirements, the Bank shall require the applicant to monitor the 
AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring 
requirements of  960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The 
Bank also shall require the applicant to require the sponsor or 
owner of the project to submit to the applicant such reports and 
certifications as are required under  960.15(c) of the proposed 
rule. In addition, the applicant shall require the loan fund or 
loan consortium to report to the applicant any new loan or grant 
made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a loan fund or 
loan consortium receives loans or grants from an applicant 
pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such funds 
must be reported separately.

Under  960.17(d)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule, if the Bank 
contracts with the loan fund or loan consortium to meet the 
monitoring requirements in  960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed 
rule, the Bank shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to 
monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring 
requirements of  960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The 
Bank also shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to 
require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to the loan 
fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications as are 
required under  960.15(c) of the proposed rule. In addition, the 
loan fund or loan consortium shall report to the Bank any new loan 
or grant made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a 
loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or grants from an 
applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such 
funds must be reported separately. 

The monitoring and reporting requirements in  960.17(d) of the 
proposed rule are a change from the provisions on monitoring and 
reporting in the Board's existing policy guidelines, which require 
the applicant to monitor the loan fund or loan consortium and 
require the Bank to monitor the applicant. This change is 
intended to conform the monitoring and reporting requirements for 
projects involving loan funds or loan consortia with the proposed 
monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to AHP-assisted 
housing projects generally under   960.14 and 960.15 of this 
proposed rule. 

Section 960.17(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that a loan 
fund or loan consortium receiving loans or grants from applicants 
pursuant to the AHP and the project sponsors and owners receiving 
loans or grants from loan funds or loan consortia are subject to 
the corrective and remedial actions contained in  960.16 of the 
proposed rule for fraud and non-compliance with respect to the AHP 
requirements. 

Section 960.17(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in 
the event of a loan fund's or loan consortium's fraud or willful 
non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the 
full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the loan 
fund or loan consortium by the applicant and returned to the Bank, 
or if previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the 
Bank from the loan fund or loan consortium. 

Section 960.17(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule requires an 
applicant that provides a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan 
consortium pursuant to the AHP to have in place either: 

(1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable 
mechanism that permits the applicant to recover from the loan fund 
or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful 
non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to 
the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy; or 

(2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally 
enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the 
applicant, and the loan fund or loan consortium, that permits the 
Bank to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium, in the 
event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan 
consortium with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount 
of the AHP subsidy. 

Section 960.17(e)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that 
in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful 
non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full 
amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered by the loan fund or 
loan consortium from the sponsor or owner to be used for 
additional AHP projects.

Section 960.17(e)(3)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that 
the loan fund or loan consortium shall have in place a legally 
binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that 
permits it to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of 
the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of the 
sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect 
to the AHP requirements, and the applicant shall have in place a 
legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism 
that permits it to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium 
such amount recovered by the loan fund or loan consortium from the 
sponsor or owner. 
Section 960.17(e)(3)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule also provides 
that the applicant shall have in place, if the Bank agrees and 
such agreement is legally enforceable, a four-party agreement that 
includes the Bank, the applicant, the loan fund or loan 
consortium, and the sponsor or owner, that permits the Bank to 
recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP 
subsidy provided to the project in the event of the sponsor's or 
owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the AHP 
requirements. 
Section 960.17(e)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required 
remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance with respect 
to the AHP requirements, upon written request by the Bank, 
applicant, loan fund or loan consortium, sponsor or owner. 


M. Required Annual AHP Contributions 


Section 960.18 of the proposed rule requires each Bank to fund 
its AHP annually in accordance with the formula set forth in 
section 10(j)(5) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(5). Proposed 
 960.18 is consistent with  960.10 of the Board's existing AHP 
regulation, except for minor wording changes and deletion of 
language regarding required funding in 1990 through 1993 which is 
no longer necessary. See 12 CFR 960.10. 

Specifically, proposed  960.18 provides that each Bank 
shall fund its AHP in accordance with the following formula: 

(a) In 1994, the greater of: 

(1) 6 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous year; 
or 

(2) That Bank's 

pro rata

 share of an aggregate of $75 million 
to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made 
on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous 
year. 
(b) In 1995 and each year thereafter, the greater of: 
 

(1) 10 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous 
year; or 

(2) That Bank's 

pro rata 

share of an aggregate of $100 million 
to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made 
on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous 
year. 
The term ``net earnings of a Bank'' is defined in proposed 
 960.1. The definition has been revised from the definition in 
the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more accurately 
track its definition in section 10(j)(8) of the Act. See 12 CFR 
960.1(j); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(8). 


N. Temporary Suspension of AHP Contributions 



Section 960.19 of the proposed rule sets forth the provisions 
governing temporary suspensions by Banks of their required annual 
AHP contributions. A number of revisions have been made to this 
section in the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more 
accurately track the language in section 10(j)(6) of the Act 
concerning this section and to provide greater clarity. See 
12 CFR 960.11; 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). 


1. Application for Temporary Suspension

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 960.19(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if a 
Bank finds that the contributions required pursuant to proposed 
 960.18 are contributing to the financial instability of the 
Bank, the Bank shall notify the Board promptly, and may apply in 
writing to the Board for a temporary suspension of such 
contributions. 

Section 960.19(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that a 
Bank's application for a temporary suspension of contributions 
shall: 
(i) State the period of time for which the Bank seeks a 
suspension; 
(ii) State the grounds for a suspension; 
(iii) Include a plan for returning the Bank to a financially 
stable position; and 
(iv) Be accompanied by the Bank's preceding year's annual 
financial report, if available, and the Bank's most recent 
quarterly and monthly financial statements and any other financial 
data the Bank wishes the Board to consider. 
The requirement in paragraph (ii) above is not explicitly 
required in the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR 
960.11(a). 
Paragraph (iv) above adds to the Board's existing regulation 
that the Bank may include any other financial data it wishes the 
Board to consider. 



2. Board Review of Application for Temporary Suspension 


a. 

Grounds for approval of application.

 
Section 960.19(b)(1) of the proposed rule provides that, in 
reviewing a Bank's application for a temporary suspension of 
contributions to determine the Bank's financial instability, the 
Board shall consider the following factors: 
(i) Whether the Bank's earnings are severely depressed. This 
language was added to track the statutory standard in section 
10(j)(6) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). In addition, the 
Board shall consider the extent to which the Bank's quarterly or 
annual net earnings have decreased from the preceding quarter or 
year, and whether such decline is projected to continue; 
(ii) Whether there has been a substantial decline in the Bank's 
membership capital. The Board shall consider the extent to which 
the Bank's paid-in membership capital has declined in any given 
quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to 
continue;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) Whether there has been a substantial reduction in the 
Bank's advances outstanding. The Board shall consider the extent 
to which the Bank's level of advances has declined in any given 
quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to 
continue; and 

(iv) Whether any other financial condition exists with respect 
to the Bank which has resulted in, or is likely to result in, the 
financial instability of the Bank. 

b. 

Limitations on grounds for approval of application.

 
Section 960.19(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Board shall disapprove an application for a temporary suspension 
if it determines that the Bank's reduction in earnings is a result 
of: 

(i) A change in the terms of advances (other than subsidized 
advances) to members which is not justified by market conditions; 

(ii) Inordinate operating and administrative expenses; or 

(iii) Mismanagement. 

The ``reduction in earnings'' language replaces the term 
``financial instability'' used in the Board's existing regulation, 
because the former is the term used in the Act. See 12 CFR 
960.11(c); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). 

In addition, the requirement in  960.11(c)(5) of the Board's 
existing regulation that the Bank shall disapprove an application 
if for any other reason the temporary suspension is not warranted, 
is deleted in the proposed rule because it is not required by the 
Act, and limits the Board's discretion to balance reasons 
warranting approval of an application for a temporary suspension. 
See 12 CFR 960.11(c)(5); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). 



3. Board Decision 



Section 960.19(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Board 
shall approve or disapprove a Bank's application for a temporary 
suspension within 30 calendar days of receipt of such application, 
and the Board's decision shall be in writing and shall be 
accompanied by specific findings and reasons for its action. A 
copy of the Board's decision shall be forwarded to each of the 
Banks. 



4. Board Approval of Application for Temporary Suspension 



Section 960.19(d)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if the 
Board approves a Bank's application for a temporary suspension, 
the Board's written decision shall specify the period of time such 
suspension shall remain in effect.

<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 960.19(d)(2) of the proposed rule provides that during 
the term of a temporary suspension approved by the Board, the 
affected Bank shall provide to the Board such financial reports as 
the Board shall require to monitor the financial condition of the 
Bank, and the Board shall continue to monitor the Bank's financial 
condition. The requirement that the Board shall monitor the 
Bank's financial condition is added because it is required by the 
Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6)(D). 

Section 960.19(d)(3) of the proposed rule provides that if, 
prior to the conclusion of the temporary suspension period, the 
Board determines that the Bank has returned to a position of 
financial stability, the Board may, upon written notice to the 
Bank, terminate the temporary suspension. 



5. Application for Extension of Temporary Suspension Period 



Section 960.19(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if a 
Bank's board of directors determines that the Bank has not 
returned to, or is not likely to return to, a position of 
financial stability at the conclusion of the temporary suspension 
period, the Bank may apply in writing for an extension of the 
temporary suspension period, stating the grounds for such 
extension. 

Proposed  960.19(e)(2) provides that the Board shall approve 
or disapprove a Bank's application for an extension of a temporary 
suspension period within 30 calendar days of receipt of such 
application. 

Proposed  960.19(e)(3) provides that the Board's decision on 
an application for an extension of a temporary suspension period 
shall be in writing, shall be accompanied by specific findings and 
reasons for such action, and shall state the effective date and 
time period if an extension is approved. 



6. Notice to Congress 



Section 960.19(f)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the 
Board shall notify the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate not less than 60 
calendar days before any temporary suspension (or extension of 
such suspension) approved pursuant to this section takes effect. 

Deleted from this provision is the requirement in the Board's 
existing regulation that a copy of the Board's suspension decision 
shall be forwarded to the Congress since, as discussed above, the 
Act only requires that the Board provide notice to Congress of the 
suspension decision. See 12 CFR 960.11(f); 12 U.S.C. 
1430(j)(6)(F). 

Proposed  960.19(f)(2) provides that a temporary suspension 
(or extension of such suspension) shall become effective as 
determined by the Board, unless a joint resolution of Congress is 
enacted disapproving such suspension (or extension thereof). The 
proposed rule deletes the provision in the Board's existing 
regulation that a temporary suspension extension may not take 
effect until at least 30 days after the Board gives the required 
notice to Congress, because this is inconsistent with the 
requirement in the existing regulation that the Board must notify 
the Congress at least 60 days before such extension takes effect. 
See 12 CFR 960.11(g). 

Proposed  960.19(f)(2) also deletes from the Board's existing 
regulation the requirement that a joint resolution of Congress 
disapproving a suspension or extension of a suspension must be 
enacted prior to the Board's determined effective date, in order 
to track more closely the actual language in the Act. See 12 
U.S.C. 1430(j)(6)(F). 



O. Affordable Housing Reserve Fund 



Consistent with the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
 960.20(a) of the proposed rule provides that if a Bank fails to 
use or commit the full amount of its required annual contribution 
to the AHP, 90 percent of the amount that has not been used or 
committed in that year shall be deposited by the Bank in an 
Affordable Housing Reserve Fund established and administered by 
the Board. See 12 CFR 960.12. The 10 percent of the unused and 
uncommitted amount retained by the Bank should be fully used or 
committed by the Bank during the following year, and any remaining 
portion must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 
A Bank is deemed to have used or committed its required 
contribution where amounts are remaining at the end of the year 
because funding the next highest ranking project would exceed the 
Bank's required AHP contribution for the year. Such amounts 
remaining shall be combined with returned AHP funds to fund the 
next highest scoring AHP project or projects, or carried over by 
the Bank to the next year's AHP funding cycles. 

The language allowing these amounts to remain at the end of the 
year is added in the proposed rule to take into account situations 
where amounts remain uncommitted at the end of the year because 
the balance of required AHP contributions remaining is too small 
to fund the Bank's next highest scoring AHP application. 

The last sentence in proposed paragraph (a) also is new, making 
explicit that such amounts remaining and funds returned to the 
Bank shall fund other AHP projects and need not be transferred to 
the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 

Section 960.20(b) of the proposed rule provides that by January 
15 of each year, each Bank shall provide to the Board a statement 
indicating the amount of unused and uncommitted funds from the 
prior year, if any, which will be deposited in the Affordable 
Housing Reserve Fund.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00084 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Proposed  960.20(c) provides that by January 31 of each year, 
the Board will notify the Banks of the total amount of funds, if 
any, available in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 
Section 960.12(d) of the Board's existing regulation governing 
how any Reserve Funds would be made available to the Banks, is 
deleted in the proposed rule. See 12 CFR 960.12(d). The Act 
states that such provisions would be determined pursuant to 
regulations issued by the Board. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(7). Since 
there currently are no Reserve Funds and it is not anticipated 
that there will be any Reserve Funds in the near future, it is not 
necessary at this time to include provisions in the proposed rule 
dealing with this issue. The Board can issue regulations on this 
issue at a future date if such eventuality should arise. 


P. Advisory Councils 


Section 960.21 of the proposed rule sets forth provisions 
governing the appointment, operation, and responsibilities of the 
Advisory Councils to the Banks. 
Section 960.21(a)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank 
shall appoint an Advisory Council of seven to 15 persons who shall 
reside in the Bank's District and shall be drawn from community 
and nonprofit organizations actively involved in providing or 
promoting low- or moderate-income housing in the Bank's District. 

See 12 CFR 960.14(a). In addition,  960.21(a)(1) of the proposed 
rule provides that the size of the Advisory Council shall be 
stated in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. 
Section 960.21(a)(2) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the Bank 
must actively solicit nominations from Bank members and community 
and nonprofit organizations and shall allow sufficient time for 
response, so that the nomination and appointment process is as 
broad and as participatory as possible. See 12 CFR 960.14(b), 
(d). The Bank also should solicit nominations from any other 
interested parties. In addition,  960.21(a)(3) of the proposed 
rule provides that Advisory Council members shall be appointed by 
the Banks giving consideration to the size of the District and the 
diversity of low-income housing needs within the District. 
The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that officials of 
state and local housing finance agencies may serve as members of 
an Advisory Council, provided that such officials do not 
constitute an undue proportion of the membership of the Advisory 
Council. See 12 CFR 960.14(c). It has been suggested that such 
officials should only be able to serve as non-voting members of an 
Advisory Council, unless the officials also are employed or 
associated with a private community or nonprofit organization 
actively involved in providing or promoting low- or 
moderate-income housing in the Bank's District. This suggestion 
is based on the view that the Advisory Councils are intended to 
serve as vehicles for private sector community and nonprofit 
organizations, not public agencies, to advise the Banks on low- 
and moderate-income housing programs and needs in the District and 
on the utilization of Bank advances for such purposes. See 
12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(11). While acknowledging that officials of 
state and local housing finance agencies make valuable 
contributions to the Advisory Councils, the supporters of this 
viewpoint argue that these agencies have opportunities to 
influence the allocation of housing finance credit through means 
other than by voting representation on the Advisory Councils. 
The Board specifically requests comments on whether or not 
officials of state and local housing finance agencies should be 
able to vote on the Advisory Councils and whether their 
representation should be limited so that it does not constitute an 
undue proportion of the Advisory Council membership. 
Section 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule provides that 
Advisory Council members shall serve for terms of two or three 
years, as determined by the Bank and set forth in its AHP 
implementation plan. The Board is proposing to give the Banks the 
option of appointing Advisory Council members for three-year terms 
in order to allow the Banks to benefit from the experience and 
familiarity with the AHP that Advisory Council members develop the 
longer they serve on an Advisory Council. In addition, 
 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that terms of 

Advisory Council members shall be staggered to provide continuity 
and experience in service. See 12 CFR 960.14(f). The proposed 
rule requires the Banks to explain in their AHP implementation 
plans how Advisory Council member terms will be staggered. 
Section 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule contains a new 
provision limiting an Advisory Council member to six years of 
consecutive service. The Bank may set its own limits on 
consecutive terms within the six-year limit. This provision is 
intended to ensure that the membership of the Advisory Councils 
reflects the diverse and changing viewpoints of private sector 
community and nonprofit organizations on the low-income housing 
programs and needs of the Bank Districts.

<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 960.21(a)(5) of the proposed rule provides that an 
Advisory Council member who, subsequent to appointment, is no 
longer employed by or associated with a community or nonprofit 
organization actively involved in providing or promoting low- or 
moderate-income housing in the Bank's District may continue to 
serve on the Advisory Council until the end of his or her term. 
Allowing the Advisory Council member to serve out the remainder of 
his or her term promotes continuity in the collective experience 
of the Advisory Council. Further, the member may still have 
relevant experience related to low-income housing needs in the 
District, which may continue to benefit the Advisory Council. 
However, the Board recognizes that the Advisory Council member may 
no longer represent the interests of the community and nonprofit 
sector. Therefore, the Board specifically requests comments on 
this provision of the proposed rule. The Board also specifically 
requests comments on whether a member who is no longer employed by 
or associated with a community or nonprofit organization should be 
entitled to vote on the Advisory Council if he or she becomes a 
state or local housing finance agency official. 
Section 960.21(b) of the proposed rule provides that each 
Advisory Council shall elect from among its voting members a 
chairperson and a vice chairperson. 
Section 960.21(c) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement of the Board's existing AHP regulation that each 
Advisory Council shall designate a member, or request that a 
member of the Bank's staff be designated, to act as secretary to 
the Advisory Council. See 12 CFR 960.14(g). The secretary shall 
record and maintain the minutes of the meetings of the Advisory 
Council, which shall contain, among other things, a record of the 
persons present, a description of the matters discussed, and 
recommendations made. The person acting as secretary at a meeting 
shall certify to the accuracy of the minutes of that meeting. 
Section 960.21(d)(1) of the proposed rule adds a new 
requirement that, prior to the approval of the Bank's proposed AHP 
implementation plan by the Bank's board of directors, the Bank's 
Advisory Council shall review the proposed AHP implementation plan 
and provide its recommendations to the Bank's board of directors 
pursuant to the requirements of  960.2(c) discussed above under 
the section on the adoption of the AHP implementation plan. This 
provision is intended to give the Advisory Councils a greater role 
in advising the Banks on how AHP funds should be allocated to meet 
the low-income housing needs in their Districts. 
Section 960.21(d)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new 
requirement that upon request of the Advisory Council, the Bank 
shall provide the Advisory Council with copies of any AHP 
applications from prior AHP funding cycles. The Board is aware 
that some Banks have already adopted this practice. This 
requirement is intended to aid the Advisory Council members in 
evaluating how the AHP application priorities and scoring criteria 
adopted by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan affect the 
allocation of AHP funds among different types of housing projects. 
Further, this requirement is subject to any limitations of other 
laws that may require the Bank to keep information in an AHP 
application confidential. The Bank may require Advisory Council 
members to agree to keep all or parts of AHP applications 
confidential. The Board specifically requests comments on the 
advantages and disadvantages of allowing Advisory Council members 
to examine AHP applications received by the Bank in prior AHP 
funding cycles. 
Section 960.21(e) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the 
Advisory Council shall meet with representatives of the board of 
directors of the Bank at least quarterly to advise the Bank on 
low- and moderate-income housing programs and needs in the Bank's 
District and on the utilization of AHP subsidized advances and 
direct subsidies for these purposes. See 12 CFR 960.14(a). 
Section 960.21(f) of the proposed rule requires each Advisory 
Council to submit to the Board annually by March 1 its analysis of 
the low-income housing activity of its Bank. This is a change 
from the January 31 date in the Board's existing AHP regulation, 
and is intended to give the Advisory Councils sufficient time 
after the end of the year to compile and evaluate year-end data in 
order to prepare their reports to the Board. See 12 CFR 
960.14(j).

<TEXT>
 

Section 960.21(g)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the 
requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank 
shall reimburse members of its Advisory Council for transportation 
and subsistence expenses they incur for each day devoted to 
attending quarterly meetings with representatives of the board of 
directors of the Bank. See 12 CFR 960.14(e). Section 
960.21(g)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new requirement that each 
Bank shall pay members of its Advisory Council a fee for each day 
devoted to attending quarterly meetings with representatives of 
the board of directors of the Bank. The Board is proposing this 
change in light of the additional responsibility given to Advisory 
Council members under the proposed rule to advise the Banks on 
preparation of the AHP implementation plans. The Board 
specifically requests comments as to whether the Banks should be 
required to pay fees, and whether the amount to be paid should be 
set forth in the final AHP rule so that a uniform fee is paid to 
all Advisory Council members, or whether the fees should be set by 
the board of directors of each Bank. 



Q. Effective Dates 



Section 960.22 of the proposed rule provides that, if published 
as a final rule, this part shall become effective 30 days from 
such publication in the 

Federal Register

. In addition, the 
provisions of this part, or portion thereof, may be applied to 
projects approved for AHP funding prior to the effective date of 
the final rule to the extent all relevant parties agree thereto in 
writing. The Finance Board would not need to approve any such 
retroactive application of the final rule. This proposed 
provision is intended to allow the retroactive application to 
existing AHP projects of provisions of the revised AHP rule that 
are less restrictive than existing AHP requirements, to the extent 
all relevant parties (the Bank, the applicant, the sponsor, the 
owner, and if applicable, the loan fund or loan consortium) agree 
to such application of the new provisions. The Board specifically 
requests comments on this proposed provision. 



III. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The proposed rule applies only to the Banks, which do not come 
within the meaning of ``small entities,'' as defined in the

 960.5 

Long-term requirements. 



(a) 

Rental housing units. 

(1) At least 20 percent of the 
rental housing units in a project financed under the AHP with 
subsidized advances or direct subsidies shall remain affordable 
for and occupied by very low-income households for a minimum 
period of 30 years or, at the election of the sponsor, the 
remaining useful life of such units, except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An applicant and the project 
sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment 
regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility, 
affordability and income-targeting requirements contained in this 
paragraph (a)(1). An applicant may commit to maintain additional 
units as affordable for and occupied by low- or moderate-income 
households, which commitment shall be for a minimum period of 30 
years or, at the election of the sponsor, the remaining useful 
life of such units, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. The Bank's AHP implementation plan shall set forth the 
procedures that the Bank will follow to effectively implement the 
requirements of this paragraph (a)(1). 

(2) A household occupying a rental housing unit subject to the 
income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
is required to satisfy the income-eligibility requirement of such 
paragraph applicable to such income-targeted unit, as committed to 
in the AHP application, upon initial occupancy. The household may 
continue to occupy the income-targeted unit even if its income 
increases above the income-eligibility requirement for such unit. 
The unit may continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting 
requirement committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent 
charged remains affordable to the household as defined in  960.1; 
however, if the household's income rises above 140 percent of the 
income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application, the 
sponsor must make the next available rental housing unit in the 
project affordable to and available for occupancy by a household 
whose income is at or below the income-targeting level committed 
to in the AHP application for the original unit, and once the next 
available rental housing unit is so occupied, the rent charged on 
the unit occupied by the household whose income has risen shall no 
longer be subject to the requirement that it be affordable for 
households at the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP 
application. 

(3) An owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell 
the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which 
the project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must 
remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at 
or below the levels committed to in the AHP application; however, 
either: 

(i) The purchaser must agree to continue the project's 
rental units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and 
occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the 
long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must 
agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that 
applied to the seller; or

(ii) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, and if the Bank provided a 
direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to 
the seller, the seller must repay a pro rata portion of the grant 
as provided in  960.16(d)(1); or 

(iii) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, and if the Bank provided a 
subsidized advance to the applicant which in turn provided a below 
market rate loan to the seller, then the provisions of 
 960.16(d)(2) shall apply. 

(b) The Bank's AHP implementation plan shall permit the owner 
of an AHP-assisted rental housing project to sell such project as 
provided for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

applications that meet the threshold criteria shall be scored 
pursuant to the criteria contained in  960.10, as set forth in 
the Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. 

(b) The Bank shall approve the applications in descending order 
starting with the highest scoring application until the total AHP 
funding amount for the particular funding cycle, except for any 
amount insufficient to fund the next highest scoring project, has 
been allocated. The Bank also may approve the next four highest 
scoring applications as alternates and, within one year of 
approval by the Bank, may fund such alternates if any previously 
committed AHP funds become available. 



 960.9 

Threshold criteria for approval of AHP applications.

housing costs (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) 
for income-eligible households, as committed to in the AHP 
application, to 20 percent of the household's gross monthly 
income. In projects where other forms of federal, state, local or 
private subsidized assistance are being used in conjunction with 
AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies, the total amount of 
subsidized assistance, including funds provided under the AHP, 
shall not be in excess of the amount needed to reduce the monthly 
housing costs (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) 
for the income-eligible households, as committed to in the AHP 
application, to 20 percent of the household's gross monthly 
income.

(B) For households in AHP-assisted rental housing units, rent 
payments, and where they are not already included in rent 
payments, a reasonable estimate of utility costs excluding 
telephone service. 

(iii) A household subject to the 20 percent requirement set 
forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is required to meet such 
requirement only at the time it initially purchases or occupies a 
unit. 
(2) 

Alternative requirements. 

(i) The requirement in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section shall not apply where a Bank provides 
subsidized advances or direct subsidies to an applicant for a 
rental housing project, which project also receives funds from a 
federal or state rental housing program that requires qualifying 
households to pay as rent a certain percentage of their monthly 
income or a designated amount, provided that the household meets 
the housing payment requirements of the other program. 

(ii) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall 
not apply where: 

(A) The total amount of the AHP funds provided through a 
subsidized advance or direct subsidy used to finance 
rehabilitation of a housing unit by a very low-income household 
that already owns and occupies the housing unit is $10,000 or less 
per such household; or

subsidized advance or direct subsidy used to finance the purchase 
of a housing unit by a very low-income household is $5,000 or less 
per such household. 

(iii) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall 
not apply where the total amount of the AHP funds provided through 
a subsidized advance or direct subsidy used to finance 
rehabilitation or purchase of a housing unit by a low- or 
moderate-income household is $5,000 or less per such household. 

(iv) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall 
not apply where a Bank provides subsidized advances or direct 
subsidies ultimately benefiting a household with an income at or 
below the level committed to in the AHP application, which is 
participating in a self-help, sweat equity or similar housing 
program that requires the household to contribute its skilled or 
unskilled labor valued at a minimum of $2,000 per household, 
working cooperatively with others, to construct or rehabilitate 
housing which the household or other program participants are 
purchasing or already own and occupy, and that involves 
supervision of the work performed by skilled builders or 
rehabilitators. 
(d) 

Project feasibility.

 The AHP application must indicate 
that the proposed project is feasible in that, based on an 
analysis of project sources and uses of funds, project multi-year 
operating pro formas for rental housing projects, projections of 
sales and prices for owner-occupied housing units, and local 
market conditions, the project is financially viable and likely to 
be completed within a reasonable period of time, and is likely to 
operate or sell and remain affordable to the designated 
income-eligible households over the long-term period committed to 
in the AHP application. 
(e) 

Qualifications of sponsor.

 960.10 

Scoring of AHP applications. 



(a) 

General. 

The Bank shall score AHP applications that satisfy all of 
the threshold criteria in  960.9 according to the scoring 
methodology set forth in this section which shall be included in 
the Bank's approved AHP implementation plan. 
(b) 

Priority treatment. 

Each application is first evaluated to 
determine if it will receive priority treatment. For purposes of 
determining priority, an application can receive a maximum of 
eight points for each of the five priority categories set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section. A Bank in its AHP implementation 
plan shall define more specifically each of the five priority 
categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for 
satisfying each category. An application will be deemed to meet a 
particular priority category if it is awarded at least four points 
for that priority category. Applications meeting at least two 
priority categories shall receive priority treatment. 

(c) 

Order of scoring. 

Applications that qualify for priority treatment pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section shall be scored before 
applications that do not qualify for priority treatment. The 
applications that do not qualify for priority treatment will not 
be scored unless there are insufficient priority treatment 
applications to utilize the total AHP funding amount for the 
funding cycle. 

(d) 

Priorities_40 point category. 

The Bank shall total the 
points received by each applicant for purposes of determining 
priority for all of the five priority categories set forth in this 
paragraph (d); it shall award 40 points to the application(s) that 
receive the highest number of total points, and the remaining 
application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points on a 
declining scale basis. The five priority categories are as set 
forth in the following paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this 
section. 

(1) 

Government-owned properties. 

Applications for projects 
that finance the purchase or rehabilitation of housing owned or 
held by the United States Government or any agency or 
instrumentality of the United States, including but not limited to 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Resolution Trust 
Corporation, Farmers Home Administration, Veterans Administration, 
Federal National Mortgage Association, or Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation. 

(2) 

Nonprofit or state or local government sponsored projects.

 
Applications for projects that finance the purchase, construction 
or rehabilitation of housing the sponsor of which is a nonprofit 
organization, a state or political subdivision of a state, a local 
housing authority or a state housing finance agency. 

(3) 

Special needs projects. 

Applications for projects that 
address special needs, which shall be defined by the Bank in its 
AHP implementation plan, which special needs may include but are 
not limited to: 

(i) Empowering the households or residents through programs 
such as resident management of the property, self-help housing, 
homesteading, and sweat equity;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-1-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) Providing housing for special needs populations such as 
homeless persons, abused or battered persons, persons with AIDS, 
mentally or physically disabled persons, or persons with substance 
abuse problems; 

(iii) Providing housing in rural areas or areas targeted by 
local, state or federal governments for community development or 
revitalization through the development of affordable housing or 
economic investment; or 

(iv) Providing housing with special services to meet the needs 
of low- or moderate-income households including, but not limited 
to, child care, job training, medical care, substance abuse 
programs, independent living skill training, and rental household 
and homeowner household counseling. 

(4) 

District Bank priority. 

Applications for projects that 
meet one or more priorities recommended by the Bank's Advisory 
Council and adopted by the Bank's board of directors that each 
address a housing need in the Bank's district and are consistent 
with the purposes of this part. The Bank shall describe in its 
AHP implementation plan how the points for the priority or 
priorities will be distributed. 

(5) 

Economic mobility priority. 

Applications for projects that 
provide housing for low- or moderate-income households that move 
from low- or moderate-income neighborhoods or housing projects to 
neighborhoods, mixed-income buildings or owner-occupied housing 
developments in which at least 50 percent of the households have 
incomes above the median income for the area, as published by the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

(e) 

Targeting_20-point category. 

An application can receive a 
maximum of 20 points for this category. The Bank shall award 
points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s) 
serve(s) the greatest percentage of very low-, low- and 
moderate-income households, in that priority order. In the 
alternative, if a weighted-average scoring methodology is provided 
in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, the Bank shall award points 
to an application based on the extent to which the project has the 
lowest weighted-average income determined by multiplying the 
percentage of units reserved for households at certain income 
levels by those incomes expressed as a percentage of median 
income, and adding the totals. Applications shall be scored 
relative to each other with the maximum number of points allowable 
awarded to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the targeting 
objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted 
and awarded points on a declining scale basis. However, 
owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and 
rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group. 

(f) 

Other objectives. 

The five other objectives categories are 
as set forth in the following paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of 
this section. The Bank in its AHP implementation plan shall 
define more specifically each of the five other objectives 
categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for 
satisfying each category. For each category, the Bank shall award 
the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the 
application(s) that best achieve(s) the objective, and the 
remaining application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points 
on a declining scale basis. 

(1) 

AHP subsidy per unit_10-point category. 

An application 
can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank 
shall award points to applications based on the extent to which 
the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per 
AHP-subsidized unit. Projects should be scored relative to each 
other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as 
one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a 
separate group. This scoring criterion may not include a 
leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on 
the percentage of the project's total development cost that is to 
be financed with the AHP subsidy. 

(2) 

Applicant participation_5-point category. 

An application 
can receive a maximum of 5 points for this category. The Bank 
shall award points to applications based on the extent to which 
the project involves participation by applicants other than the 
receipt of a subsidized advance or direct subsidy under the AHP. 
Such participation can be financial or non-financial, including 
but not limited to debt or equity financing of the project, grants 
to the project, applicant involvement on the boards of nonprofit 
sponsors, and applicant provision of technical assistance to the 
nonprofit sponsors for the project. 

(3) 

Community involvement_10-point category. 

An application 
can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank 
shall award points to applications based on the extent to which 
there is demonstrated support for the project by local community 
organizations and individuals other than as project sponsors, such 
as through the commitment by such organizations and individuals of 
funds, goods and services, and volunteer labor. 

(4) 

Community stability_10-point category. 

An application can 
receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall 
award points to applications based on the extent to which the 
project(s) maximize(s) community stability, such as by: 
committing to a greater long-term period pursuant to  960.5; 
revitalizing vacant or abandoned properties or being integrally 
part of a neighborhood stabilization plan, if such revitalization 
or stabilization is not identified as a special needs category by 
the Bank pursuant to  960.10(d)(3)(iii); and not displacing low- 
or moderate-income households, or if such displacement will occur, 
indicating how such households will be assisted to minimize the 
impact of such displacement. 

(5) 

Innovation_5-point category. 

An application can receive a 
maximum of 5 points for this category. The Bank shall award 
points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s) 
involve(s) a particularly new or unusual approach, either 
financial or non-financial, for meeting the requirements of this 
part. 



 960.11 

Modifications of approved AHP applications. 



(a) An applicant that seeks a modification of an approved AHP 
application before completion and occupancy of the project must 
submit a request for such modification in writing to the Bank for 
review and approval. A modification is any change that affects or 
could potentially affect the material facts under which the 
application was originally evaluated and scored.

(c)(1) The Bank shall review the request for modification, 
shall re-score the application as proposed to be modified 
according to the scoring criteria used in the AHP funding cycle in 
which the application was originally approved, and may approve 
such request if the following factors are satisfied: 

(i) The project as proposed to be modified continues to meet 
all of the requirements of this part; and 

(ii) The project as proposed to be modified continues to score 
high enough that it would have been approved in its AHP funding 
cycle. 

(2) If the application does not satisfy the requirements in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Bank in its discretion may 
approve the request for modification if the reason for the 
modification is due to circumstances outside the control of the 
applicant or sponsor. 

(d) The Bank shall forward to the Board a detailed summary of 
any modification of an AHP application approved by the Bank, 
including how the Bank re-scored the project, within 30 calendar 
days of the approval of such modification.

Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies 



 960.12 

Use of AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies 
within reasonable period of time and verification of reasonable 
progress. 



(a) The Bank shall in its AHP implementation plan identify what 
constitutes reasonable progress by the sponsor towards using 
subsidized advances or direct subsidies within a reasonable period 
of time after the approval of an AHP application for different 
types of projects, and explain how it intends to verify such 
reasonable progress. 

(b) The sponsor must demonstrate that reasonable progress is 
being made towards using the requested funds within a reasonable 
period of time after approval of the AHP application, as 
determined by the Bank under paragraph (a) of this section.

determine whether it has satisfied the requirement in paragraph 
(b) of this section. 

(d) If the sponsor fails to satisfy the requirement in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Bank shall cancel the AHP 
award, and shall not disburse any subsidized advances or direct 
subsidies through the applicant to the sponsor, and the full 
amount of any previously disbursed subsidized advances or direct 
subsidies shall be returned to the Bank. 



 960.13 

Verification at initial disbursement of AHP subsidized 
advances or direct subsidies. 



At the time of initial disbursement of a subsidized advance or 
a direct subsidy by a Bank for an approved AHP application, the 
Bank shall verify in writing that the project complies with all 
applicable requirements contained in  960.9 and all obligations 
committed to in the approved AHP application. The Bank shall 
verify the amount of subsidy being provided in connection with the 
application and being charged against the AHP fund. The Bank 
shall include in its AHP implementation plan its verification 
procedures for such purposes. 



Subpart G_Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 



 960.14

(d) 

Monitoring during construction or rehabilitation. 

If 
subsidized advances or direct subsidies are used to finance 
construction or rehabilitation of a project, the Bank shall 
require the applicant to monitor the construction or 
rehabilitation until completion, and to make progress reports to 
the Bank, as required under  960.15(b)(2). 

(e) 

Monitoring long-term requirements._

(1) 

Owner-occupied housing._

(i) 

Initial certification. 

At the time a household enters into 
a purchase contract for an AHP-assisted housing unit or at the 
closing on the financing for such unit, or at the time a household 
that already owns a housing unit receives a commitment of a loan 
or a grant pursuant to the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall 
obtain a certification from the sponsor, as required under 
 960.15(c)(1)(i), that the household has an income at or below 
the level committed to in the AHP application. 

(ii) 

Monitoring after initial sale. 

(A) During the required 
long-term period applicable to an owner-occupied housing unit 
assisted by a grant provided under the AHP, the Bank or its 
designee shall monitor the unit to determine whether it has been 
sold to a household with an income that exceeds the level 
committed to in the AHP application. 

(B) Monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic 
review of relevant reports or certifications obtained from the 
sponsor, including reports and certifications received pursuant to 
 960.15(c)(1)(ii) and, at least on a sample basis, periodic 
review of land title records at intervals to be determined by the 
Bank, based on the amount of funds received by the project 
pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or 
other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. 

(2) 

Rental housing._

(i) 

Restriction on transfer. 

The Bank shall require an AHP-assisted rental housing project to be subject to a deed 
restriction or other legally enforceable mechanism which requires 
that upon sale of the project prior to the end of the long-term 
period during which the project's rental units, or portion 
thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households 
with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP 
application, the Bank or its designee receives notice of the sale, 
and: 

(A) The project's rental units, or portion thereof, must 
continue to be affordable for and occupied by households with 
incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application 
for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP 
application, and the purchaser agrees to be subject to the same 
restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or 

(B) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and if the Bank provided a 
direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to 
the seller, the seller must repay the grant as provided in 
 960.16(d)(1); or 

(C) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and if the Bank provided a 
subsidized advance to the applicant which in turn provided a below 
market rate loan to the seller, then the provisions of 
 960.16(d)(2) shall apply. 

(ii) 

Initial certification. 

Upon initial full occupancy of the 
units in an AHP-assisted rental housing project, or one year after 
initial disbursement of the subsidized advance or direct subsidy, 
whichever occurs first, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a 
certification from the sponsor or the owner, as required under 
 960.15(c)(2), that the project's units, or portion thereof, are 
affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at initial 
occupancy at or below the levels committed to in the AHP 
application. 

(iii) 

Monitoring after initial occupancy. 

(A) During the 
long-term period for which the units, or portion thereof, of an 
AHP-assisted rental housing project must remain affordable for and 
occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee 
shall monitor the project to determine whether the project's 
units, or portion thereof, remain affordable for and occupied by 
households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the 
AHP application. 

(B) Monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic 
review of relevant household income and rent reports or 
certifications obtained from the sponsor or the owner, including 
certifications received pursuant to  960.15(c)(2) and, at least 
on a sample basis, periodic inspections of the project at 
intervals to be determined by the Bank, based on the amount of 
funds received by the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and 
complexity of the project, or other factors deemed relevant by the 
Bank. 

(f) 

Monitoring compliance with the special needs priority. 

If 
an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing 
project that will address a special need pursuant to 
 960.10(d)(3), either through providing units for persons with a 
special need, or through providing a special service for 
occupants, as defined in the Banks AHP implementation plan: 

(1) The Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from 
the sponsor or owner upon completion and occupancy of the project, 
as required under  960.15(c)(3), that the project's units, or 
portion thereof, are occupied by persons with such special need, 
as committed to in the AHP application, or that a special service 
is being provided, as committed to in the AHP application; and 

(2) In the case of a special service being provided pursuant to

Where a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is used to finance 
the purchase of an owner-occupied housing unit, the Bank shall 
require the sponsor to certify, at the time a household enters 
into a purchase contract for such unit or at the closing on the 
financing for such unit, that the unit has been sold to a 
household with an income at or below the level committed to in the

used to finance the rehabilitation of an owner-occupied housing 
unit, the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the time a 
loan or grant is committed to fund such rehabilitation that the 
household that owns and occupies the unit has an income at or 
below the level committed to in the AHP application.

 If an owner-occupied housing 
unit assisted by a grant provided under the AHP is not subject to 
a deed restriction or other legally enforceable mechanism 
restricting transfer of ownership to a household with an income at 
or below the level committed to in the AHP application, the Bank 
shall require the sponsor to report to the Bank or its designee, 
at least annually for the required long-term period, the number of

that the project's units, or portion thereof, are affordable for 
and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application.

Subpart H_Corrective and Remedial Actions for Fraud or Non-Compliance With AHP Requirements 



 960.16

Corrective and remedial actions for fraud or 
non-compliance. 



(a) 

Fraud or willful non-compliance.

 (1) In the event of an 
applicant's, sponsor's or owner's fraud with respect to the 
requirements of this part, the Bank shall exclude the applicant, 
sponsor or owner, respectively, on a permanent basis, from future 
participation in the AHP. In the event of an applicant's, 
sponsor's or owner's willful non-compliance with the requirements 
of this part, the Bank shall suspend the applicant, sponsor or 
owner, respectively, at least on a temporary basis, from future 
participation in the AHP during the period such willful 
non-compliance continues, and may exclude such party permanently 
from future participation in the AHP.

non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the 
Bank shall recover from the applicant the full amount of the AHP 
subsidy provided to the project. 

(3)(i) In the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful 
non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the 
full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the sponsor 
or owner by the applicant and returned to the Bank or, if 
previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the Bank 
from the sponsor or owner. If efforts to recover the AHP subsidy 
from the sponsor or owner are unsuccessful, the applicant shall 
not be liable for such funds.

(ii) The applicant shall have in place either: 

(A) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable 
mechanism that permits it to recover from the sponsor or owner the 
full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the 
event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance 
with respect to the requirements of this part; or 

(B) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally 
enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the 
sponsor or owner and the applicant that permits the Bank to 
recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP 
subsidy provided to the project in the event of a sponsor's or 
owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the 
requirements of this part. 

(4) The Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any 
required remedial actions under this paragraph (a) upon written 
request by the Bank, applicant, sponsor or owner. 

(b) 

Other types of non-compliance.

 In the event of an 
applicant's, sponsor's or owner's non-compliance with the 
requirements of this part that is not willful, such as due to 
inadvertent errors by such party or changes in circumstances that 
are outside such party's control, the Bank shall provide the party 
a reasonable period of time in which to take reasonable efforts, 
pursuant to a compliance plan approved by the Bank, to remedy the 
non-compliance. The Bank in its discretion may exclude the 
applicant, sponsor or owner from participation in the AHP while 
such party is under a compliance plan, or in its discretion may 
require the applicant to increase the long-term period committed 
to in its AHP application for the project by the amount of time 
the project has been in non-compliance. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes no reasonable efforts to comply with
the compliance plan, then such party is in willful 
non-compliance with the requirements of this part and is subject 
to the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes reasonable 
efforts pursuant to the compliance plan to remedy the 
non-compliance under this paragraph (b) and such efforts are 
unsuccessful, the applicant, sponsor or owner would be subject to 
the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this section, 
but may apply to the Bank for a waiver of any such required 
remedial actions. The Bank shall report to the Board in writing 
on any waivers approved pursuant to this paragraph (b) within 30 
calendar days of such approval. 

(c) 

Sale of AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing unit to 
income-ineligible household.

 Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, in the event that a household sells its 
AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing unit to a household whose 
income exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application prior 
to the end of the required long-term period, then the provisions 
of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section shall apply. 

(1) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant 
which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall 
require the seller to repay a 

pro rata

 share, except for 

de 
minimis

 amounts, of the grant received by such seller, reduced for 
every year the seller owned the unit, to be repaid from any net 
gain from the sale of the unit after deduction for sales expenses, 
and to be returned to the Bank, except that the Bank in its 
discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such 
requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by 
the Bank in its AHP implementation plan. 

(2) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant 
and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, 
the applicant shall either repay to the Bank that portion of the 
advance used to make the loan to the seller or the Bank shall 
convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the 
seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the 
market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any 
unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to 
subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the 
seller shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP 
projects. 

(3) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this 
section shall not apply provided the sponsor, pursuant to a 
legally binding agreement with the Bank, assists another household 
with an income at or below the level committed to in the AHP 
application in the manner originally committed to in the AHP 
application. 

(d) 

Sale of AHP-assisted rental housing project.

 In the event 
that the owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project sells the 
project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the 
project's rental units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable 
for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels 
committed to in the AHP application, and the purchaser does not 
agree to maintain the project according to such commitments and to 
be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the 
seller, then the provisions of either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of 
this section shall apply. 

(1) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant 
which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall 
require the seller to repay a 

pro rata

 share, except for 

de 
minimis

 amounts, of the grant received by such seller, reduced for 
every year the seller owned the unit, to be repaid from any net 
gain from the sale of the project after deduction for sales 
expenses, and to be returned to the Bank, except that the Bank in 
its discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of 
such requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as 
defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or 

(2) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant 
and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller, 
the applicant shall either repay the advance to the Bank or the 
Bank shall convert the advance to a market rate advance with an 
interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the 
advance was made, and any unused AHP subsidy which had been set 
aside by the Bank to subsidize the advance shall be made available 
by the Bank for additional AHP projects.

 960.17 

AHP applications involving loan funds and loan 
consortia. 



(a) 

General.

 (1) An applicant may use a subsidized advance or 
a direct subsidy to make a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan 
consortium as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. 

(2) AHP applications involving the use of loans or grants by 
loan funds or loan consortia pursuant to the AHP are governed by 
the provisions of this part, except as otherwise provided in this 
section. 

(b) 

AHP application approval requirements.

 The requirements 
for approval of an AHP application that proposes to use subsidized 
advances or direct subsidies to make a loan or a grant to a loan 
fund or a loan consortium are governed by the provisions of 
 960.8, except that: 

(1) The application will be scored on the criteria that the 
loan fund or loan consortium proposes to use to select projects 
that will ultimately receive a loan or grant from the loan fund or 
loan consortium that is subsidized by the AHP; and 

(2) The Bank shall review and shall require the applicant to 
review each new rental housing project funded by a loan fund or 
loan consortium prior to disbursing the loan or grant to ensure 
that: 

(i) The project meets the threshold requirements of  960.9; 
and 

(ii) The project meets the criteria committed to in the approved 
AHP application. 

(c) 

Use of funds.

_(1) 

Subsidized advances. 

If an applicant 
receives a subsidized advance and uses the proceeds of the advance 
to make a loan to a loan fund or loan consortium, the loan fund or 
loan consortium shall extend credit to the borrower at a rate of 
interest equal to the rate of interest charged on the subsidized 
advance plus a reasonable interest rate spread approved by the 
Bank. The applicant and the loan fund or loan consortium may 
determine between themselves what proportion of the interest rate 
spread the applicant and the loan fund or loan consortium will 
share. 

(2) 

Direct subsidies.

 (i) If an applicant receives a direct 
subsidy from a Bank and in turn provides a grant to a loan fund or 
loan consortium, the loan fund or loan consortium must either: 

(A) Pass the entire grant on to the recipient; 

(B) Use the entire grant to lower the interest rate on a loan 
to the borrower; or 

(C) Lend the entire grant to the borrower to finance a rental 
housing project for a term of not less than 30 years, with all 
principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such 
term. If such loan is repaid before the end of the 30-year term, 
the entire amount of the grant must be repaid to the applicant, 
which in turn must forward the funds to the Bank to be used for 
additional AHP projects. 

(ii) If a loan fund or loan consortium provides both a loan and 
a grant to a borrower and the loan fund or loan consortium charges 
an origination fee for providing the loan, then any fee charged by 
the loan fund or loan consortium for providing the grant may not 
be paid with AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Calculation of interest rate.

 When a loan fund or loan 
consortium receives a grant from an applicant pursuant to the AHP 
and uses the grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the 
borrower, the interest rate calculation must be consistent with 
the procedure used by the Bank for calculating the amount of AHP 
subsidy needed for a subsidized advance, taking into account the 
source of funds used by the loan fund or loan consortium for its 
loans and the rate that normally would be charged for a loan of 
the type and term that is provided to the borrower. 

(3) 

Interest or other income earned on loans or grants.

 If an 
applicant receives a subsidized advance or direct subsidy from a 
Bank and in turn provides a loan or grant to a loan fund or loan 
consortium, any interest or other income earned by the loan fund 
or loan consortium on such funds, not including any approved fee 
or interest rate spread charged to the borrower, either: 

(i) Must be used by the loan fund or loan consortium to provide 
funds for additional projects meeting the threshold requirements 
in  960.9 and the criteria committed to in the approved AHP 
application; or 

(ii) Must be forwarded to the applicant, which in turn must 
forward the funds to the Bank to be used for additional AHP 
projects. 

(4) 

Loans or grants from multiple AHP funding cycles.

 If loans 
or grants received by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to 
one AHP funding cycle are combined with loans or grants received 
by such entity pursuant to another AHP funding cycle in a single 
rental housing project, the loan fund or loan consortium shall 
require the recipient of the funds to follow the requirements for 
the use of such funds from the AHP funding cycle that is more 
restrictive as to the approved AHP criteria. The requirement does 
not apply when loans or grants received by a loan fund or loan 
consortium pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles are combined to 
finance a single owner-occupied housing project; however, the loan 
fund or loan consortium in its discretion may require the 
recipient of the funds to follow the requirements for the use of 
such funds from the AHP funding cycle that is more restrictive as 
to the approved AHP criteria. 

(5) 

Using repayments of loans within reasonable period of time.

 
Any loans provided by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to 
the AHP that are repaid to such entity must be re-lent or provided 
as grants by such entity within a reasonable period of time after 
such repayments, or must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn 
must repay such funds to the Bank, and must be made available by 
the Bank for additional AHP projects. The Bank shall in its AHP 
implementation plan identify what constitutes a reasonable period 
of time for such purposes. 

(d) 

Monitoring and reporting

_(1) 

General.

 Where loans or 
grants are provided by an applicant pursuant to the AHP to a loan 
fund or loan consortium which uses the funds to finance 
owner-occupied or rental housing units, the Bank shall: 

(i) Monitor such units according to the monitoring requirements 
of  960.14(e) through (h); 

(ii) Require the sponsor or owner of a project receiving loans 
or grants from the loan fund or loan consortium to submit such 
reports and certifications to the Bank as are required under 
 960.15(c); and 

(iii) Require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the 
Bank any new loan or grant made using the repayments of loans by 
the borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or 
grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, 
the use of such funds must be reported separately. 

(2) 

Exceptions.

 (i) The Bank may contract with the applicant 
to meet the monitoring requirements of  960.14 (e) through (h), in 
which case the applicant shall: 

(A) Monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the 
monitoring requirements of  960.14 (e) through (h); 

(B) Require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to 
the applicant such reports and certifications as are required 
under  960.15(c); and 

(C) Require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the 
applicant any new loan or grant made using the repayments of loans 
by the borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans 
or grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding 
cycles, the use of such funds must be reported separately. 

(ii) The Bank may contract with the loan fund or loan 
consortium to meet the monitoring requirements of  960.14 (e) 
through (h), in which case the loan fund or loan consortium shall: 

(A) Monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the 
monitoring requirements of  960.14 (e) through (h); 

(B) Require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to 
the loan fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications 
as are required under  960.15(c); and

(C) Report to the Bank any new loan or grant made using the repayments of loans by the borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium
receives loans or grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such funds must be reported
separately. 
(e) 

Corrective and remedial actions for fraud or non-compliance with AHP requirements. 

(1) A loan fund or loan consortium receiving loans or grants from an applicant pursuant to the AHP and the project sponsors
or owners receiving loans or grants from a loan fund or loan consortium are subject to the corrective and remedial actions
contained in  960.16 for fraud and non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part. 
(2)(i) In the event of a loan fund's or loan consortium's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements
of this part, the full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the loan fund or loan consortium by the applicant
and returned to the Bank or, if previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the Bank from the loan fund or loan
consortium. 
(ii) An applicant that provides loans or grants to a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to the AHP shall have in place
either:

or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect
to the requirements of this part, the full amount of the AHP subsidy; or 
(B) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank,

in the event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to the requirements
of this part, the full amount of the AHP subsidy. 
(3)(i) In the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this
part, the full amount the AHP subsidy shall be recovered by the loan fund or loan consortium from the sponsor or owner,

(ii)(A) The loan fund or loan consortium shall have in place a legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable
mechanism that permits it to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project
in the event of the sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part,
and the applicant shall have in place a legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that permits
it to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium such amount recovered by the loan fund or loan consortium from the
sponsor or owner; or

that includes the Bank, the applicant, the loan fund or loan consortium and the sponsor or owner, that permits the Bank
to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of the sponsor's
or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part. 
(4) The Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required remedial actions under this paragraph (e) for fraud
or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, upon written request by the Bank, applicant,

Temporary suspension of AHP contributions. 


(a) 

Application for temporary suspension.

of the Bank, the Bank shall notify the Board promptly, and may apply in writing to the Board for a temporary suspension
of such contributions.

(b) 

Board review of application for temporary suspension._

(1) 

Grounds for approval of application. 

In reviewing a Bank's application for a temporary suspension of contributions to determine the Bank's financial
instability, the Board shall consider the following factors: 
(i) Whether the Bank's earnings are severely depressed. The Board shall consider the extent to which the Bank's quarterly
or annual net earnings have decreased from the preceding quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to
continue; 
(ii) Whether there has been a substantial decline in the Bank's membership capital. The Board shall consider the extent
to which the Bank's paid-in membership capital has declined in any given quarter or year, and whether such decline
is projected to continue; 
(iii) Whether there has been a substantial reduction in the Bank's advances outstanding. The Board shall consider
the extent to which the Bank's level of advances has declined in any given quarter or year, and whether such decline
is projected to continue; and 
(iv) Whether any other financial condition exists with respect to the Bank which has resulted in, or is likely to result
in, the financial instability of the Bank. 
(2) 

Limitations on grounds for approval of application. 

The Board shall disapprove an application for a temporary suspension if it determines that the Bank's reduction in
earnings is a result of: 
(i) A change in the terms of advances (other than subsidized advances) to members which is not justified by market conditions;

(ii) Inordinate operating and administrative expenses; or 
(iii) Mismanagement. 
(c) 

Board decision.

be accompanied by specific findings and reasons for such action, and shall state the effective date and time period
if an extension is approved. 
(f) 

Notice to Congress.

 (1) The Board shall notify the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and
the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate not less than 60 calendar days before any temporary
suspension (or extension of such suspension) approved pursuant to this section takes effect. 
(2) A temporary suspension (or extension of such suspension) shall become effective as determined by the Board, unless
a joint resolution of Congress is enacted disapproving such suspension (or extension thereof). 


Subpart K_Affordable Housing Reserve Fund 


 960.20 

Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 


(a) If a Bank fails to use or commit the full amount it is required to contribute to the AHP in any year pursuant to  960.18,
90 percent of the amount that has not been used or committed in that year shall be deposited by the Bank in an Affordable
Housing Reserve Fund established and administered by the Board. The 10 percent of the unused and uncommitted amount
retained by the Bank should be fully used or committed by the Bank during the following year, and any remaining portion
must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. A Bank is deemed to have used or committed its required contribution
where amounts are remaining at the end of the year because funding the next highest ranking project would exceed the
Bank's required AHP contribution for the year. Such amounts remaining shall be combined with returned AHP funds to
fund the next highest scoring AHP project or projects, or carried over by the Bank to the next year's AHP funding cycles.

(b) By January 15 of each year, each Bank shall provide to the Board a statement indicating the amount of unused and uncommitted
funds from the prior year, if any, which will be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. 
(c) By January 31 of each year, the Board will notify the Banks of the total amount of funds, if any, available in the Affordable
Housing Reserve Fund.

Small Business Size Standards; Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to terminate waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for several classes of metal products.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) intends to terminate existing waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for:
(1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy; (2) plate sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy; (3) wire,
nonelectrical, high nickel alloy; (4) bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass; (5) plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper-nickel, and copper; (6) sheet and plate aluminum products; and (7) structural shapes, angles, channels,
tees and zees, aluminum and high nickel alloy. SBA's intent to terminate these waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
is based on our recent discovery of small business manufacturers for these classes of products. Terminating these
waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small or 8(a) businesses to provide the products of small
business manufacturers or processors on such contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 100-656, enacted on November 15, 1988, incorporated into the Small Business Act the previously existing
regulation that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA 8(a) Program procurements
must provide the products of small business manufacturers or processors. The SBA regulations imposing this requirement
are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). Section 210 of Public Law 101-574 further amended the law to allow
for waivers for classes of products for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors ``available
to participate in the Federal procurement market.'' The actions which the SBA is proposing to take with respect to
existing waivers and the reasons for those actions follow:

Regulatory Review



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice requests that the public identify regulations that it believes should be amended or eliminated to reduce
undue regulatory burdens, if any, consistent with the FAA's statutory safety, security, and other public interest
responsibilities. This notice asks each commenter to identify, in order of priority, those regulations that are
believed to be unwarranted or inappropriate. In order to focus agency consideration, each commenter is asked to concentrate
on no more than three regulations he or she believes to be of primary concern. The agency asks further that each commenter
provide a brief explanation of: (1) The bases for the three highest priority recommendations to amend or eliminate
the regulations; (2) the ways in which each regulation's objective is otherwise fulfilled (

e.g., 

by duplicative regulations or by technological advances that render the regulations obsolete); and (3) where appropriate,
a suggested substitute or amended version of the regulations identified. This information will help the FAA to respond
to the Administration's direction to design regulations in the most effective manner to achieve their regulatory
objective.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

With this Notice, the FAA is undertaking an evaluation aimed at eliminating or amending existing rules and regulations
that may not be necessary to achieve the agency's safety, security, and other public interest responsibilities.
This effort initiates a response to the recommendations of the 15-member National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive
Airline Industry, the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, and DOT and FAA regulatory
initiatives.



In April 1993, the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission) was established
by Public Law No. 103-13. The Commission was asked to investigate, study and make policy recommendations regarding
the financial vitality and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries.

In August 1993, the Commission issued a report to the President and Congress that addressed, among other things, the
legal and administrative policies that govern the regulatory responsibilities imposed on United States airlines.
The Commission found that Federal regulations impose a cumulative burden on airlines. While the FAA has not quantified
that burden, the Commission estimated that existing rules have added to airline costs and concluded that the costs
of these rules have a direct impact on the airlines' financial condition.

To enhance the FAA's ability to perform its statutory role without undue economic impact on the aviation industry,
the Commission recommends that the ``FAA/DOT undertake a short-range regulatory review_in close consultation
with industry and other interested parties_to eliminate or amend existing regulations to reduce regulatory burdens
consistent with safety and security considerations.''

In addition, Executive Order 12866 requires that agencies ``identify regulations that are cumulative, obsolete,
or inconsistent, and where appropriate, eliminate or modify them.'' In light of these concerns, and consistent with
the Administration's Civil Aviation Initiative, this notice solicits public comment that will assist the FAA in
focusing attention on areas where the public believes the regulatory burden is excessive and unjustified. In particular,
the agency requests that each commenter identify the most significant regulations that the commenter believes may
no longer be necessary, are unduly burdensome, or impose excessive costs or red tape. In some cases, for example, important
innovations, technologies, or new market opportunities may have taken place or may have been created since a rule
was promulgated, potentially rendering a rule obsolete.

The FAA requests commenters to focus their recommendations on up to three regulations they believe to be of primary
concern_rather than catalogue all rules that they may view to be objectionable in some respect. This will facilitate
development of a manageable overall proposal. Further, each commenter should rank 

in priority order

 the regulations that the commenter believes the agency should address first. In addition, each submission should
include an explanation of: (1) How the identified regulatory requirement is burdensome; (2) how the requirement
should be changed or deleted, including, where possible, suggested draft substitutes; (3) how a regulatory change
would benefit the public; and (4) how a proposed regulatory change would provide an adequate level of safety, security,
or environmental protection. Specific economic information to support a reliable cost/benefit analysis of the
proposed change will also be of assistance.

Comments in response to this notice are also expected to facilitate the FAA's regulatory review envisioned by Executive
Order No. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' issued September 30, 1993. This executive order requires each
agency to create a program under which it will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine
whether any should be modified or eliminated to make the agency's regulatory program more effective and less burdensome.

The comments provided in response to this notice will assist the agency in establishing its priorities for future
regulatory changes, including repeal or modification of rules where appropriate, to maintain safety and security
while reducing regulatory burdens.

Organization and Procedures; Procedures of the Office of Hearings and Appeals; Authority of Appeals Officers to
Deny a Request for Appeals Council Review 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend 20 CFR 422.205, which describes the organization and procedures of the Appeals Council,
to authorize Appeals Officers, as well as members of the Appeals Council, to deny a request for review of a decision
by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Part 422 of 20 CFR provides information regarding the organization and procedures of the Social Security Administration
(SSA). Subpart C of part 422 describes the procedures of the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). Section 422.205
describes the organization and functions of the Appeals Council, a part of OHA. 

By direct delegation of authority from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), the Appeals Council
is authorized to review hearing decisions and orders of dismissal issued by SSA's ALJs. Through the exercise of this
authority, the Appeals Council is responsible for ensuring that the final decisions of the Secretary involving benefits
under titles II, XI, XVI and XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) and part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety
and Health Act of 1977, as amended, are proper and in accordance with the law, regulations, and binding agency policy
established in Social Security Rulings and Acquiescence Rulings. 

Currently, 20 Appeals Council members, hereinafter referred to as either ``Administrative Appeals Judges (AAJs)''
or ``members,'' comprise the membership of the Appeals Council. The Associate Commissioner for OHA is the Chair of
the Appeals Council and is the administrative officer directly responsible to the Commissioner of Social Security
for carrying out OHA's mission of holding ALJ hearings and deciding appeals. Each AAJ, other than the Chair, is assisted
by an Appeals Officer who serves as a legal clerk. Organizationally, Appeals Officers are a part of the Appeals Council.


The Appeals Council considers appeals under titles II, XI, XVI, and XVIII of the Act, and under part B of title IV of the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended. The regulations setting forth the responsibilities of the
Appeals Council appear in 20 CFR part 404 (subpart J,   404.967 

et seq.

), part 410 (subpart F,   410.657 

et seq.

), part 416 (subpart N,   416.1467 

et seq.

), and 42 CFR part 405 (subpart G,   405.701(c) and 405.724), part 417 (subpart Q,  417.634 and part
473 (subpart B,   473.46 and 473.48(b)). These regulations provide that after an ALJ has issued a decision
or dismissed a request for a hearing, the Appeals Council may review a case on its own motion or at the request of a party
to the hearing decision or dismissal. The Council may deny or dismiss a party's request for review, or it may grant the
request and either issue a decision or remand the case to an ALJ. If the Appeals Council denies a request for review of
a decision by an ALJ, the ALJ's decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary subject to judicial review under
the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act. If the Appeals Council grants a request for review and issues a decision,
that decision becomes the final decision of the Secretary subject to judicial review pursuant to section 205(g) of
the Act. 

Sections 404.970 and 416.1470 describe cases involving Social Security and supplemental security income benefits
payable under title II and title XVI of the Act that the Appeals Council will review. Those sections provide that the
Appeals Council will review a case if the action, findings or conclusions of the ALJ are not supported by substantial
evidence; there is an error of law; or there appears to be an abuse of discretion by the ALJ. Those sections also provide
that the Appeals Council will review a case that presents a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general
public interest. The same standards apply to determine if the Appeals Council will review a case under title XVIII
of the Act or under part B of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 

Over the years, there have been questions about the functions and operations of the Appeals Council. Some commenters
have questioned the usefulness of review by the Appeals Council. Several studies have addressed the role of the Appeals
Council, resulting in many recommendations for improving the Council's structure and operations.

In its Recommendation 87-7: A New Role for the Social Security Appeals Council (adopted December 18, 1987),
the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) concluded that the high volume of work of the Council (up
to 500 cases per member per month) precluded it from detecting emerging problems, identifying new issues to be resolved,
and identifying and developing needed policies. ACUS recommended that the Secretary and SSA restructure the Appeals
Council in ``a fashion that redirects the institution's goals and operations from an exclusive focus on processing
the stream of individual cases and toward an emphasis on improved organizational effectiveness'' (1 CFR 305.87-7).
To this end, ACUS recommended that ``the Appeals Council should be provided the authority to reduce significantly
its caseload and also be given, as its principal mandate, the responsibility to recommend and, where appropriate,
develop and implement adjudicatory principles and decisional standards for the disability determination process.''
ACUS also recommended that the agency enhance the status of the Appeals Council and provide law clerks to its members.


To address the workload problems ACUS discussed in its recommendation, SSA decided, in 1988, to add Appeals Officers
to the Council to enable the members to focus their attention on the more complex and significant cases, including
those cases presenting important policy or procedural issues. 

Appeals Officers presently assist AAJs in considering recommendations made by the Council's support staff in OHA's
Office of Appellate Operations. Appeals Officers, who are attorneys, also act as the AAJs' staff attorneys, researching
and providing legal memoranda on issues arising from cases that come to the attention of the Appeals Council. However,
because the Appeals Officers do not have authority under our existing regulations to carry out any of the decision
making responsibilities of the AAJs, one or more AAJs must make these decisions. 

Research we have supported since we established the Appeals Officer position has persuaded us that if the Appeals
Officers are authorized to assume some of the responsibilities of the 
AAJs, the AAJs will be able to focus more of their attention on cases that present broad policy or procedural issues.
In a report commissioned by ACUS in 1989 (Report and Recommendations on the Social Security Administration's Administrative
Appeals Process), Professor Frank S. Block discussed the Appeals Council's workload and stated that the Council
could not be expected to assume a meaningful review function for all claims that might be presented to it. One of the
recommendations in the report was that the Appeals Council be authorized ``to use staff or lower level Council members
to deny a request for review, and limit the review of cases by the Appeals Council to those raising significant policy
issues.'' See Recommendation No. 12. 

To complete the changes we contemplated when we established the Appeals Officer position, we propose to amend  422.205
to authorize Appeals Officers to deny a request for review of an ALJ hearing decision. Because an ALJ's dismissal of
a request for a hearing is not subject to judicial review, AAJs will continue to decide whether to grant or deny a request
for review of a hearing dismissal. Appeals Officers will continue to receive guidance, direction and supervision
from AAJs, including instructions as to specific issues or kinds of cases requiring the attention of the AAJ.

We believe this proposed change, which provides Appeals Officers a specific and limited authority, will improve
both the quality and efficiency of the service the Appeals Council is able to provide. The proposed change should allow
the Council to give the public a more timely response to their requests for review and increase the ability of the AAJs
to carry out their important function of providing review of many ALJ decisions. 

Although the Appeals Officer under the proposed rule would have authority to deny a request for review of an ALJ decision,
he or she may also refer a particular case to an AAJ with a recommendation if it involves complex factual issues or complicated
interpretative issues of law and/or regulations. In addition, all cases in which an analyst in OHA's Office of Appellate
Operations prepares a recommendation to grant a request for review will be submitted directly to an AAJ for disposition.
We believe this process will serve two purposes: (1) It will expedite bringing the ``close cases,'' which are normally
more complex, to the AAJ's attention; and (2) it will allow the AAJs to focus on those cases raising significant issues.


We propose to make this change in the regulation concerning the operating procedures of the Appeals Council under
the provisions of sections 205, 1102, and 1631 of the Act. These statutory sections give the Secretary broad regulatory
authority to establish procedures that are necessary and appropriate to carry out the Act's provisions. 



Regulatory Provisions 



The proposed rule will enable the Appeals Officers to decide whether a request for review of an ALJ decision should
be denied, thereby making the decision of the ALJ the final decision of the Secretary for the purpose of any request
for judicial review which a party to the decision may decide to file under section 205(g) of the Act. The Appeals Officers
will not have authority to grant a request for review, to decide to review a case on the Appeals Council's own motion,
to remand a case to an ALJ, to grant or to deny a request to review a hearing dismissal, or to issue a final decision. The
authority to exercise those powers of the Council will remain exclusively with the AAJs. 

Appeals Officers will be required to apply the same criteria as the AAJs in determining whether to deny a request for
review. The Appeals Officers will apply the provisions of   404.970 and 416.1470, which specify when
the Appeals Council will review a case, in determining the appropriate action. 




Judges,'' or by the proposed change to expand the authority of the Appeals Officers, who organizationally are part
of the Council. 



Regulatory Procedures 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Individuals are not included in the definition of a small entity. However,
for purposes of the RFA, we consider the majority of Medicare providers, physicians and suppliers to be small entities.


Inasmuch as the proposed rule does not alter the standards for Appeals Council review, we believe that it will have
little, if any, effect on providers, physicians and suppliers which substantial number of small entities. Individuals
are not included in the definition of a small entity. However, for purposes of the RFA, we consider the majority of Medicare
providers, physicians and suppliers to be small entities.

Inasmuch as the proposed rule does not alter the standards for Appeals Council review, we believe that it will have
little, if any, effect on providers, physicians and suppliers which request Appeals Council review of Medicare claims.
Accordingly, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule will not result in a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we have not prepared an RFA analysis.

Removal of Obsolete and Redundant Regulations and Appendices



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is proposing to remove obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices from the Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). In addition, the FHWA is proposing minor technical changes in an effort to keep the FMCSRs
current. The removal of obsolete and redundant regulations and appendices is one of the first actions taken by the
FHWA following the Agency's Zero Base Regulatory Review public outreach sessions. The deletion of these regulations
should result in the reduction of the paperwork burden on the industry without any reduction in safety benefits.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background




The primary focus of the FHWA's Motor Carrier Safety Program is to reduce commercial motor vehicle (CMV) accidents
and the attendant fatalities, injuries, and property losses. To remain effective, regulations must reflect trends
in State regulatory practices as well as technical and operational changes in the motor carrier industry. The motor
carrier safety regulations were initially promulgated and enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
in 1937. In 1967 the Department of Transportation (DOT) was created by the Department of Transportation Act of 1966,
(Pub. L. 89-670, 80 Stat. 931) and the regulatory and enforcement authority for motor carrier safety was transferred
to the DOT. Today this authority is vested in the FHWA.


Over the years, the FMCSRs have been modified incrementally, usually by addition of new provisions and often because
of congressional mandates. Some sections, however, no longer correspond to current practices in the motor carrier
industry, and others have been superseded by State or local initiatives. In September 1992, the Federal Highway Administration
began a comprehensive multi-year effort to re-create a body of safety rules and regulations that are (1) understandable,
(2) enforceable, (3) capable of being implemented by industry, and above all, (4) consistent with highway safety.
The effort has been termed ``Zero Base Regulatory Review.'' The review will not edit the current regulations, but
will start with the basic questions of who, what, and how do we regulate and what is essential to improve motor carrier
safety.

Concurrent with the Zero Base effort, the FHWA participated in a governmentwide review of regulations designed to
identify regulations that were no longer required or unnecessarily hindered economic growth. The FHWA's proposed
deletions were incorporated into an NPRM published by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) on May 20,
1992 (57 FR 21362). On December 22, 1992, the OST published a final rule but declined to take final action on the FHWA
proposals. 57 FR 60725.

Docket comments submitted in response to the May 20 NPRM, and other comments received in conjunction with the FHWA's
Zero Base review effort, were evaluated by the FHWA in preparing the current NPRM. The FHWA has identified several
requirements that are obsolete or redundant, i.e., which are repeated by State law or covered in another part of the
FMCSRs or which could be reissued as non-regulatory guidance.



Discussion



Criteria Used for Regulation Review



The objectives of the FHWA's regulatory review were to (1) eliminate requirements not needed to carry out the regulatory
program; (2) ensure that rules are clear and succinct; (3) reduce lengthy and excessively detailed regulations whenever
possible; (4) eliminate redundancy; (5) eliminate excessive reporting requirements; and (6) reduce or eliminate
paperwork burdens wherever possible, without compromising safety.



Section-by-Section Analysis



Part 391_Qualifications of Drivers



The primary function of part 391 is to ensure that operators of CMVs meet minimum physical standards and possess the
knowledge, skills, and abilities to operate CMVs safely. The FHWA has reviewed the regulations in part 391 and has
determined that all requirements pertaining to the written examination and record of violations are unnecessary,
for the reasons set forth below.

Written examination. 

The written examination tests prospective drivers on the rules and requirements established by the FMCSRs. However,
the examination is an instructional tool only and a person's qualification is not affected by his or her performance
on the examination. Carriers are not obligated to take applicants' scores into consideration when making hiring
decisions, so the Federal requirement is of only marginal usefulness. Carriers may continue to give the test, but
the FHWA will no longer require them to do so. Moreover, drivers who are subject to the Commercial Driver's License
(CDL) requirements must pass a knowledge test to obtain a CDL, so for CDL holders the written exam is both redundant
and ineffectual. Therefore, the written examination (contained in appendix C) and all related qualification and
recordkeeping requirements would be removed. The sections to be removed or amended by this proposal include   391.11(b)(11);
391.35; 391.37; 391.51(c)(5); 391.51(d)(3); 391.61; 391.67(a); 391.67(c); 391.69(b); 391.71(a) and appendix
C to subchapter B.


List of violations. 

The objective of the record of violations is to notify the employing motor carrier of all of a driver's moving violations
of motor vehicle traffic laws. This information is to be used by the carrier to ensure that its drivers have not been
disqualified to drive a CMV.
The CDL regulations require CMV drivers to notify their current em
