Summer Food Service Program for Children; Program Reimbursement for 1994



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice informs the public of the annual adjustments to the reimbursement rates for meals served in the Summer
Food Service Program for Children (SFSP). These adjustments reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index and are required
by the statute governing the Program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) and thus is exempt from
the provisions of that Act. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), no new recordkeeping
or reporting requirements have been included that are subject to approval from the Office of Management and Budget.




This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.559 and is subject to the provisions
of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials, (7 CFR part
3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983).



Definitions



The terms used in this Notice shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the regulations governing the Summer Food Service
Program for Children (7 CFR part 225).



Background



Pursuant to section 13 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1761) and the regulations governing the SFSP (7 CFR
part 225), notice is hereby given of adjustments in Program payments for meals served to children participating in
the SFSP during the 1994 Program. Adjustments are based on changes in the food away from home series of the Consumer
Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the period November 1992 through November 1993.

The new 1994 reimbursement rates in dollars are as follows:










The total amount of payments to State agencies for disbursement to Program sponsors will be based upon these Program
reimbursement rates and the number of meals of each type served. The above reimbursement rates, before being rounded-off
to the nearest quarter-cent, represent a 1.91 per cent increase during 1993 (from 141.5 in November 1992 to 144.2 in
November 1993) in the food away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. Because of the relatively small adjustment, the Department
points out that several of the new administrative rates are identical to the rates in effect for the 1993 Program.




Authority:

 Secs. 9, 13 and 14, National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1758, 1761 and 1762a).

Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 4, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
reviews of the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components thereof, whether cured or uncured (industrial
belts), from Japan. These reviews cover one manufacturer/exporter and the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992
and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. 



We gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on our preliminary results. Based on our analysis of the comments
received, we have not changed the margins from those presented in our preliminary results. 

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



On November 4, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 58839) the preliminary results of its 1991-92 and 1992-93 administrative reviews of the antidumping
duty order on industrial belts from Japan (June 14, 1989, 54 FR 25314, amended August 4, 1989, 54 FR 32104). The Department
has now completed these reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).




Scope of the Reviews 



Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured
or uncured, from Japan. These products include V-belts, synchronous belts, and other industrial belts, in part or
wholly of rubber or plastic, and containing textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord or strand, and
whether in endless (i.e., closed loops) belts, or in belting in lengths or links. These reviews exclude conveyor belts
and automotive belts, as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered by internal combustion engines,
including trucks, tractors, buses, and lift trucks. 

During the periods of review the merchandise was classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) subheadings,
3926.90.55, 3926.90.56, 3926.90.57, 3926.90.59, 3926.90.60, 4010.10.10, 4010.10.50, 4010.91.11, 4010.91.15,
4010.91.19, 4010.91.50, 4010.99.11, 4010.99.15, 4010.99.19, 4010.99.50, 5910.00.10 5910.00.90, and 7326.20.00.
The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.


 

These reviews cover one Japanese manufacturer and exporter of industrial belts to the United States, Mitsuboshi
Belting Limited (MBL), and the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992, and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. 



Analysis of the Comments Received 



The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of these administrative
reviews. We received a case brief from MBL, and a rebuttal brief from the petitioner, Gates Rubber Company. We did not
receive a request for a hearing. 



Comment:

 MBL acknowledges that the Department's resort to best information available (BIA) is authorized under section 776(c)
of the Tariff Act, since MBL did not respond to the Department's questionnaire. 

MBL argues, however, that the Department should use information obtained in the first administrative review (1989-90)
as BIA instead of the rate from the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation. MBL contends that the Department
is required to consider the most recent information available in deciding upon a BIA rate. According to MBL, the information
provided by the respondent in the first administrative review is the most probative evidence of the current margin
because the LTFV margin was based solely on information provided by the petitioner for the period October 1986 through
March 1988. 

Furthermore, MBL argues that it could not make an informed decision to reply to the questionnaires. MBL claims that
since the Department has not completed the 1990-91 review before distributing questionnaires for the 1991-92
and 1992-93 reviews, the Department cannot infer that MBL would have responded to these questionnaires if it
believed the margins for the 1991-92 and 1992-93 reviews would be lower. Therefore, MBL claims that the
Department's conduct in this case is punitive. 

Finally, MBL points out that the International Trade Commission's affirmative injury determination is being appealed
at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). MBL urges the Department not to assess antidumping duties and
order liquidation of their entries in a review where the validity of the underlying order is in question. 

Gates argues that the Department should not change its preliminary decision to resort to the LTFV margin from the original
investigation as BIA. Gates states that MBL has provided no authority for the proposition that the Department should
use as BIA the margin from the preliminary results in the 1989-90 administrative review. Gates contends that
knowledge of results of prior reviews is irrelevant. Gates submits that MBL knew it might receive the highest rate,
and that it would have submitted information proving lower margins if it could. Finally, Gates asserts that there
is no justification for delaying completion of the reviews.

Department's Position: 

Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act requires us to use BIA ``whenever a party or any other person refuses or is unable to
produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an
investigation.'' In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take
into account whether a party refuses to provide information requested (19 CFR 353.37(b)). MBL's contention that
the Department should use the information obtained in the 1989-90 administrative review is contrary to Department
policy. When a respondent refuses to cooperate with the Department, it is our policy to assign as a dumping margin to
that respondent, as BIA, the higher of: (1) The highest rate found for any firm in the original LTFV investigation or
previous administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review (Antifriction Bearings (Other
Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France et al, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Reviews, 57 FR 28360, 28379 (June 24, 1992)). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the
CAFC (see 

Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. 

v.

 United States

, 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993), 

Krupp Stahl AG et al. 

v.

 United States

, 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). Because MBL refused to respond to the Department's questionnaire, it was reasonable
for the Department to assign to MBL, as BIA, a rate of 93.16 percent, the highest rate found for any firm in the original
LTFV investigation. Furthermore, because the law does not provide for extensions of deadlines pending the outcome
of court decisions in other proceedings, we have not delayed our final results.



Final Results of the Review



As a result of these administrative reviews, the Department determines that a dumping margin of 93.16 percent exists
for MBL for the periods June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 and June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993.

The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The
Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act:

(1) For subject merchandise exported by Mitsuboshi Belting Ltd., a cash deposit of 93.16 percent;

(2) For subject merchandise exported by manufacturers not covered in these reviews but covered in previous reviews
or in the original LTFV investigation, a cash deposit based on the most recently published rate in a final result or
determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate;

(3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the
manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and

(4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in these or any previous reviews conducted by the
Department, the cash deposit rate will be 93.16 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation,
as discussed below.

On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT) in 

Floral Trade Council 

v.

 United States

, Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company 

v.

 United States

, Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders.

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review
periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.

These administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C.
1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 28, 1992, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its 1989-90 administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift trucks from Japan. The
review covers two manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States during the period June 1, 1989
through May 31, 1990. 



The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Based on the analysis
of the comments received, the Department adjusted the margins for both companies.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On January 28, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
review of the antidumping duty order (June 7, 1988, 53 FR 20882) on certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift
trucks from Japan in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 3164). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of the Review 



The products covered by this review are certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift trucks, with lifting
capacity of 2,000 to 15,000 pounds. The products covered by this review are further described as follows: Assembled,
not assembled, and less than complete, finished and not finished, operator-riding forklift trucks powered by gasoline,
propane, or diesel fuel internal-combustion engines of off-the-highway types used in factories, warehouses, or
transportation terminals for short-distance transport, towing, or handling of articles. Less than complete forklift
trucks are defined as imports which include a frame by itself or a frame assembled with one or more component parts.
Component parts of the subject forklift trucks which are not assembled with a frame are not covered by this order. During
the review period such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 692.4025, 692.4030, and 692.4070 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). The merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized
Tariff System (HTS) item numbers 8427.20.00-0, 8427.90.00-0, and 8431.20.00-0. The TSUSA and
HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive.


The review covers sales made by Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and Toyo Umpanki Company, Limited (TCM) during
the period from June 1, 1989 through May 31, 1990. 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



For all respondent companies, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Tariff Act, the Department established categories
of ``such or similar'' merchandise on the basis of load (lifting) capacity of the forklift as imported. Within these
categories, the product comparisons were based on six primary characteristics, to which points were assigned to
indicate their relative importance. These characteristics and their point totals are as follows: Tire type, 6 points;
upright style, 5 points; engine type, 4 points; transmission type, 3 points; maximum forklift height, 2 points; and
engine size, 1 point. The sum of these numbers, the ``SSM Index Number'', was used to match U.S. and home market (HM)
sales. We considered models that both summed to 21 points as identical. Where there were no identical products sold
in the home market, the Department selected the most similar product on the basis of the point totals resulting from
the six characteristics listed above. 



Data Changes Included in the Final Results of Review 



We found that in TCM's purchase price (PP) sales analysis, we did not include in the credit expense calculation the
time between shipment from Japan and subsequent shipment to the customer by TCM's U.S. subsidiary. Therefore, for
the final results, we included these expenses. 



Analysis of Comments Received 



The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of the
petitioners, (Hyster-Yale Company, Independent Lift Truck Builders Union, International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, International Union, Allied Industrial Workers of America (AFL-CIO), and United Shop
and Service Employees) and one respondent, a hearing was held on March 19, 1992. Case and rebuttal briefs were received
from petitioners, Toyota, and TCM.

General Comments 





Comment 1: 

Petitioners contend that the Department should run its sales below cost of production (COP) test on comparison models
only, not on entire such or similar categories. Petitioners argue that forklifts are not a fungible product, but are
instead similar to ``job order'' products such as mechanical transfer presses, offshore oil platforms, and large
power transformers. Petitioners assert that the unique nature of each product means that there is often just one HM
sale that is comparable to the U.S. sale, and that if the single HM sale is sold below COP, there likely will be no dumping
margin. Petitioners state that this case is distinguishable from other dumping cases (

e.g., 

agricultural, chemical, or metals cases) because relatively few HM sales are weight-averaged. Petitioners accordingly
argue that the Department should conduct the sales below COP test on the concordance tape containing comparison models
only, not on the universe of HM sales. 

TCM argues that, because forklift trucks are not custom-built products, the Department correctly applied the COP
test. TCM further states that the Department should maintain its policy of conducting the COP test on each load capacity
category. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. In accordance with our standard policy, we have revised the sales below COP test so that
the test is conducted on a model-specific basis instead of on a such-or-similar category basis. 



Comment 2: 

Petitioners state that the Department should revise its model match methodology because it gives insufficient weight
to tire type and, therefore, results in more matches of merchandise, but not in matches that are the most similar. Petitioners
contend that tire type is a crucial attribute of a forklift truck because the tire type determines the construction
of the frame of the truck, which the Department found to be the ``identifying feature and principal component of the
product'' in the final determination in this case (Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Internal
Combustion Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan (Forklifts LTFV), 53 FR 12552 (April 15, 1988)). 

Petitioners suggest three alternative methods for the such or similar comparisons and tire type matching. First,
petitioners recommend that the Department return to the original less than fair value matching methodology. Second,
petitioners propose increasing the weight for tire type from six to ten points. Finally, petitioners state that matches
with less than fifteen points do not constitute similar merchandise because the predominant features of the HM merchandise
would be substantially different from the U.S. truck; petitioners argue that the Department should therefore omit
all HM sales with less than fifteen points. 

TCM notes that the Department's current model match methodology was revised in order to improve the model match process.
TCM and Toyota argue that the Department's matching methodology, which gives tire type the highest weight, establishes
tire type as the most important criterion. Toyota contends that petitioners' assertion that forklift trucks cannot
be similar unless they have an SSM index number of fifteen is unreasonable. This cut-off would eliminate matches of
trucks that are ``identical in every respect * * * except upright style and its related
maximum fork height.'' Respondents further argue that the Department's twenty percent difference in merchandise
test already eliminates dissimilar models, and that the cut-off suggested by petitioners would merely result in
a greater number of unmatched sales. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with respondents. During the first administrative review, we refined the model match methodology used in
the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation. We are employing this same model match methodology for these final
results. One such improvement was the use of a point-weighting scheme, which increased the precision and simplified
the reporting requirements. Of the six model match elements, we attach the most weight to tire type. Petitioners did
not provide evidence to support their claim that the points accorded to tire type should be increased from six to ten,
or that dissimilar models were matched as the result of a flaw in our methodology. For further discussion of our model
match methodology see Comment 80, Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (Forklifts I), (57 FR 3167, January 28, 1992). 



Comment 3: 

Petitioners' claim that the Department's adjustment for the consumption tax forgiven upon exportation of forklift
trucks to the United States is erroneous in several respects. Petitioners state that the Court of International Trade
(CIT) has held that taxes on sales in the HM must be passed through to the customer before an upward adjustment of an imputed
tax can be made to United States price (USP), and cite 

Zenith Electronics Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

755 F. Supp. 397 (CIT 1990) (

Zenith I

), 

Daewoo Electronics Co., 

v. 

United States, 

712 F. Supp. 931 (CIT 1989) (

Daewoo

), and 

Zenith Electronics Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

633 F. Supp. 1382 (CIT 1988) (

Zenith II

) in support of this proposition. Petitioners contend that no adjustment is warranted in this case, since neither
Toyota nor TCM claimed or proved that the consumption tax imposed on HM sales is passed through to the customers in Japan.


Petitioners further argue that the Department improperly made an adjustment to foreign market value (FMV) to eliminate
the absolute difference between the amount of tax in the two markets by adding to FMV the amount of the consumption tax
imputed to the U.S. sale. Petitioners state that it is improper for the Department to make such an adjustment in the
interest of achieving tax neutrality. 

Toyota argues that petitioners' arguments disregard the Department's policy and practice with respect to adjustments
to FMV and USP for the Japanese consumption tax. Toyota cites the Department's disagreement with the CIT decisions
cited by petitioners. Toyota asserts that it is the Department's long-standing practice not to attempt to measure
the amount of tax passed through to customers in the HM. Under the Department's interpretation, section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act does not require the Department to measure the incidence of tax in an economic sense. Rather, according
to Toyota, the full adjustment for consumption tax is necessary to make an appropriate comparison between USP and
FMV. Toyota states that in determinations involving HM taxes, the Department has repeated that it has not had an opportunity
to appeal the issue on the merits. Until such time as the issue is finally resolved on appeal, the Department should
maintain its long-standing practice.

TCM argues that the Department's consumption tax adjustment is proper and accords with the law, regulations and long-standing
practice. 


Department's Position: 

On October 7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed
on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. 

Federal-Mogul, 

Slip Op. 93-194 at 12. 
The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 

Federal-Mogul 

decisions. The Department will add to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United
States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market
sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments
will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are
included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise
price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments
to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating
the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied
upon foreign market sales. 
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment
still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses than the
price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to
mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included
in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo

. 


Comments Specific to Toyota 




Comment 4: 

Toyota contends that for the final results, the Department should not rely on best information available (BIA) to
calculate ocean freight, U.S. coop advertising, certain indirect selling expenses (ISE) incurred in Japan on behalf
of U.S. sales, and the offset expense for income and profit from other business ventures included in value-added.
Toyota claims that the Department made clear in its supplemental questionnaire that, because it was conducting two
administrative reviews simultaneously, Toyota should provide only a narrative description of how reallocations
and corrections were to be made, which were then to be the subject of petitioners' comment and Department scrutiny.
In its supplemental questionnaire response dated June 7, 1991, Toyota responded as directed, providing only narrative
descriptions, and not revised data on computer tape. 
Once the Department made its decision regarding the accuracy of these reallocations and corrections, it would give
Toyota an opportunity to resubmit its data employing the proper reallocations and corrections. Toyota states that
it was therefore awaiting the Department's decisions concerning these recalculations for the first administrative
review before submitting revised computer tapes for the second review. 
Toyota claims that at no time prior to the preliminary results, despite numerous contacts, did the Department ask
Toyota to submit the reallocations or corrections, instead directing Toyota to await the Department's decision
regarding these corrections. 

Toyota contends that in the preliminary results of this review the Department applied BIA because it mistakenly held
that Toyota had failed to comply with the Department's request for data incorporating the reallocations and corrections.
Toyota claims that it did not provide such data because the Department never issued any instructions for doing so.


Toyota therefore, proposes that the Department use data on the record to make the correct reallocations and corrections
for ocean freight, U.S. coop advertising, value-added, and Toyota Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. (TAL) ISE.

Petitioners assert that the Department specifically requested that Toyota submit corrections and reallocations
in its supplemental questionnaire. Petitioners state that Toyota failed to submit this data as requested, but rather
advised the Department that it would await the Department's decisions on these issues in the first administrative
review before submitting a complete response. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota. In our supplemental questionnaire dated May 23, 1991, we requested Toyota to provide within
a specified period of time a narrative explanation of its claimed adjustments to price after publication of the preliminary
results. 
For the final results, we did not request additional information for ocean freight, TAL ISE, and value-added because
we recalculated these expenses using information previously submitted by Toyota. See Comments 5, 7, and 8, respectively.
We did request supplemental information for coop advertising. See Comment 6. 


Comment 5: 

Toyota claims that the Department's BIA recalculation of ocean freight and marine insurance is overstated because
the Department misunderstood documents provided by Toyota in conjunction with sales preselected by the Department
for a mini-verification of sales in Washington, DC prior to, or perhaps in lieu of, an on-site verification. One of
the sales involved a forklift which had a ``mast swap'' in the United States. In other words, the truck was imported
with one mast, but, prior to sale in the U.S., the mast was switched with that of another imported truck. Toyota provided
one invoice, marked ``chassis'' showing the truck as imported, including its original mast, and a second invoice,
marked ``mast'' for another truck, which included the mast which was subsequently fitted onto the first truck. Toyota
contends that the Department erroneously calculated a per-truck ocean freight expense by adding the amounts on the
two invoices, thereby yielding a per-unit figure for ocean freight equal to ocean freight for two trucks. 
Toyota argues that the Department requested pre-verification documents, not explanations of these documents,
and that the documents were only provided to establish a paper trail for importation of the truck and not for calculation
of ocean freight. 
Toyota requests that the Department recalculate ocean freight based on one invoice or the other, or perhaps an average,
but not on two per-truck amounts added together. Toyota maintains that its original allocation of ocean freight is
accurate and should be incorporated in the final results. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota. For the final results of review, we have recalculated the ocean freight expenses by averaging
the invoices together to derive the per unit expense. 


Comment 6: 

Toyota notes a discrepancy between statements by the Department in the notice of preliminary results and the actual
BIA used to calculate sale-by-sale U.S. coop advertising expenses. The notice of preliminary results states that
the Department used the amounts Toyota reported for the first administrative review as U.S. coop expenses. See Certain
Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review (Forklifts I), 57 FR 3164 (January 28, 1992). Toyota observes that the Department actually used the largest
single reported U.S. coop expense from the second review and applied it to all sales as BIA. Toyota requests that the
Department use instead the per-customer coop expense from the first administrative review, as described in the preliminary
notice. Toyota maintains, however, that the appropriate allocation of this expense is over all sales, rather than
by dealer. 
Petitioners contend that the BIA based on information from the second, rather than the first, administrative review
is reasonable because it is based on data that is on the record in this proceeding. Accordingly, petitioners argue
that the Department should continue to apply the largest single reported U.S. coop expense from the second review
to all sales. 


Department's Position: 

In a supplemental questionnaire dated 
May 23, 1991, we requested that Toyota allocate by dealer U.S. coop advertising expenses on a sale-by-sale basis.
In a letter dated March 30, 1992, we again requested that Toyota recalculate U.S. coop advertising expenses by dealer.
On April 13, 1992, Toyota submitted this information in an acceptable form, and we have used it in lieu of BIA for the
final results. 


Comment 7: 

Toyota claims that in calculating the TAL ISE incurred with respect to U.S. sales in Japan, the Department should have
applied the ISE ratio to the TAL selling price, not to the much higher selling price of Toyota Motor Sales (TMS) in the
United States. Because the Department applied the ISE ratio to the wrong value, it greatly overstated the expense.

Toyota further contends that, as is evident from the information submitted and verified in the first review, TAL incurred
the identical category of indirect selling expenses for HM sales as for U.S. sales. Toyota states that if the Department
deducts TAL indirect selling expenses from U.S. price, it must also in fairness deduct the same category of expenses
from HM price.

<TEXT>
 



Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota that in the preliminary results we incorrectly calculated ISE incurred in Japan by TAL with respect
to U.S. sales. For the final results, we have applied the ISE factor to the reported transfer price between TAL and TMS
instead of to TMS' reported selling price in the United States. We have made a corresponding adjustment for TAL's ISE
incurred on HM sales. 



Comment 8: 

Toyota contends that the Department erred in calculating an offset to value-added expenses for income and profit
earned from other business ventures. Toyota explains that the Department reduced general and administrative (G&A)
expenses associated with value-added activity by an amount for net income and profit from other business ventures
that greatly exceeded that reported in its questionnaire response. Toyota requests that the Department revise its
income ``offset'' calculation for the final results to reflect the information contained in its questionnaire response.




Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota. For the final results, we have revised the offset calculation to reflect accurately the amounts
reported for net income and profit from other business ventures in Toyota's questionnaire response. 



Comment 9: 

Toyota claims that the Department incorrectly calculated U.S. credit expenses by using an intra-company interest
rate and not a rate based on its actual cost of borrowing from unrelated sources. Specifically, in calculating credit
expenses, the Department used the interest rate paid by TMS to Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC), its related
finance company. As a result, Toyota argues that the Department created a fictional ``expense'' that is based on an
internal transaction between TMS and TMCC which is irrelevant to the dumping analysis. Toyota urges the Department
to use the interest rate paid by TMCC on its short-term borrowings to calculate credit expenses for sales by TMS because
the rate paid by TMCC reflects Toyota's actual cost of financing from unrelated sources. 

Petitioners disagree, arguing that the interest rate paid to outside sources by TMCC does not account for the total
cost actually incurred by TMCC to extend credit to TMS. Petitioners note that TMCC incurs expenses to obtain funds
to finance its operations as well as numerous operating expenses. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to base credit
expenses for TMS simply on the short-term interest rate paid by TMCC to outside sources without accounting for the
additional expenses incurred by TMCC to extend credit on sales made by TMS. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Toyota. For the final results, we calculated U.S. credit expenses based on the experience of the sales
division of Toyota. Because TMS is the selling division in the United States, not TMCC, we determined that the interest
rate that should be used in the calculation of credit expense is one based on TMS' experience. Because TMS does not have
any short-term loans from unrelated sources, we have used the interest rate that TMCC charged TMS to reflect the credit
expenses incurred on U.S. sales. This approach is consistent with the credit expense methodology used in the previous
administrative review. 



Comment 10: 

Petitioners claim that Toyota did not report certain direct magazine advertising expenses incurred on U.S. sales.
Petitioners state that these expenses consist of advertisements in national industry publications that were directed
at end-user customers of Toyota's U.S. forklift dealers, and refer to the Toyota Industrial Equipment Division (TIE)
of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Petitioners propose recalculating Toyota's direct U.S. selling expenses to
include these advertising expenses. Petitioners suggest that the Department divide Toyota's reported cost for
magazine advertisements during the period of review (POR) by the number of forklifts sold in the U.S. over the POR,
and add this amount to U.S. direct selling expenses for each forklift. 

Toyota acknowledges that these magazine advertising expenses were classified as direct expenses by the Department
in the first review. See Forklifts I. However, respondent claims that petitioners' proposed recalculation of these
expenses is incorrect. Toyota notes that these expenses are specifically identified in its questionnaire response
and, therefore, should be separated out from reported ISE and reclassified as direct selling expenses. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with both petitioners and Toyota that these magazine advertising expenses should be properly classified
as direct selling expenses. However, we disagree with petitioners' contention that Toyota failed to report such
expenses. Toyota did report these expenses under ISE in its questionnaire response. Thus, for these final results,
we deducted the amount of magazine advertising expenses identified by Toyota from reported ISE and reclassified
such expenses as direct selling expenses. 



Comment 11: 

Petitioners claim that Toyota did not report the cost incurred to retrofit its forklifts with redesigned seats under
its operator restraint safety seat (``ORS'') program. In support of this contention, petitioners have submitted
a Toyota advertisement, which petitioners claim offers free installation of new winged safety seats and seat belts
to end-users of subject merchandise. 

Petitioners argue that all costs incurred under this program, including the cost of all advertisements, the cost
of the new seats, and the costs incurred to install the seats, should be considered direct U.S. selling expenses. Petitioners
assert that absent submission of proper information by Toyota, the Department should use the total ORS costs reported
by Toyota for the first administrative review and allocate those costs to sales during this review. 

Toyota maintains that the retrofit expenses referred to by petitioners were incurred solely for forklift trucks
imported and sold prior to the first period of review. Toyota notes that petitioners' argument erroneously implies
that the Department included retrofit expenses in its margin analysis for the first review. Respondent states that
the Department's first review verification report confirms that all trucks imported and sold during the first administrative
review period were manufactured with an ORS, thereby obviating the necessity of retrofittings. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota. Because there is no evidence on the record indicating that forklifts sold during the POR required
retrofitting, we determine that no adjustment is required. The advertisement submitted by petitioners makes no
reference to products sold during the POR. Petitioners have thus provided no evidence that Toyota incurred any such
expenses with respect to the Toyota sales made in the current POR.

Comment 12: 

Petitioners claim that Toyota failed to report U.S. product demonstration expenses, which were categorized by the
Department as direct selling expenses in the first review. Petitioners argue that Toyota should therefore be required
to provide its U.S. demonstration expenses for the final results. Petitioners assert that absent a proper submission
from Toyota, the Department should assume as BIA that the per unit product demonstration expenses in the United States
are equal to the per unit demonstration expenses reported by Toyota for its HM sales. 

Citing 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2) and Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From
the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review (AFBs I), 56 FR 31692, 31725
(July 11, 1991), Toyota maintains that it correctly categorized product demonstration expenses incurred in the
United States as ISE. Toyota claims that demonstration expenses incurred in the United States were incurred in demonstrating
forklifts to Toyota's national account customers. In contrast, Toyota states that demonstration expenses incurred
in the HM, which were reported as direct selling expenses, were incurred in demonstrating forklifts to dealers so
that they could demonstrate new models to 

their

 customers. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with petitioners that Toyota failed to report U.S. product demonstration expenses. By letter of March
30, 1992, we requested that Toyota separately report total demonstration expenses and allocate the same per forklift
truck. In its response dated April 6, 1992, Toyota claimed that it reallocated such expenses using the ratio of forklifts
under investigation to all units as reported in Exhibit C.4.i.1, page 2 of its December 5, 1990 response. However,
after reviewing the calculation, we determined that Toyota did not actually use this ratio. Thus, we corrected Toyota's
allocation for the final results. 

We agree with petitioners that demonstration expenses incurred in the United States should be categorized as direct
selling expenses because in both the HM and the United States, Toyota incurs demonstration expenses in order to make
sales to end-users. Toyota's citation to AFBs I is irrelevant because AFBs I does not offer a clear statement of policy
with regard to demonstration expenses. Absent evidence that demonstrations serve different purposes in different
markets, we determine that Toyota's U.S. demonstration expenses should be treated as direct selling expenses. See
Forklifts I. 



Comment 13: 

Petitioners contend that Toyota did not include certain U.S. customs fees (merchandise processing fee and harbor
maintenance fee) in its reported movement charges. Petitioners state that the merchandise processing fee was 0.17
percent of entered value and the harbor maintenance fee was 0.04 percent of entered value during the period of review.
For the final results, petitioners request that the Department increase Toyota's reported movement charges by these
amounts for all of Toyota's U.S. sales. 

Toyota argues that it appropriately reported such fees under brokerage and handling expenses. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota. These expenses are included in respondent's reported brokerage and handling expenses. Therefore,
no adjustment is necessary. 



Comment 14: 

Petitioners claim that the Department should resort to BIA in determining the amount of certain U.S. inland freight
costs incurred on sales made after May 1, 1990 that Toyota failed to report. 

Toyota agrees with petitioners that it failed to report certain inland freight costs incurred on sales made during
May of 1990 and that the Department should account for such costs in its final analysis. 



Department's Position: 

All parties concur that Toyota failed to report certain U.S. inland freight costs for May 1990. For the final results
we therefore used Toyota's highest reported inland freight as BIA. 



Comment 15: 

Petitioners claim that Toyota understated its U.S. value-added labor and overhead costs. Petitioners' reason for
this assertion is based on proprietary information. Petitioners request that the Department use the data in Attachment
4 of petitioners' case brief to correct these costs. 

Toyota agrees that the labor cost portion of the labor and overhead variable has been miscalculated due to a computer
programming error, but that the overhead portion is correct. 



Department's Position: 

We agree that the labor portion of the ``labor and overhead'' variable was improperly calculated, and have made the
necessary corrections, as described by Toyota, for the final results. We agree with Toyota that overhead was both
properly calculated and properly included in the calculation of the labor and overhead variable. For a complete discussion
of this issue, please refer to the analysis memorandum. 



Comment 16: 

Petitioners state that Toyota reported negative amounts for net selling price proxy 3 (which Toyota states represents
switching operations performed in TIE processing centers and includes other U.S. expenses and profit) on many of
its ESP sales. Petitioners note that these negative amounts always occur when Toyota reports a negative value for
the variable manufacturing cost of options switched by TIE.

Petitioners argue that these facts, in addition to other proprietary information, indicate Toyota assumed negative
U.S. value-added expenses on any sale for which the cost of the options removed from the forklift by TIE exceeded the
cost of options installed by TIE. Petitioners contend that Toyota incurs actual expenses to operate its value-added
facilities and to perform switching operations. They state that, for example, removing the forks from an imported
forklift results in an actual expense rather than a negative expense to TIE. Petitioners request that the Department
correct the negative costs and expenses reported by Toyota for net selling price proxy 3 by using the absolute values
of the negative amounts reported by Toyota. 
Toyota contends that petitioners misinterpreted Toyota's value-added calculation. Toyota explains that labor
and overhead are always positive; however, if the value-added materials are negative and are added to labor and overhead,
the value-added will be increased, but remain negative. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Toyota. While the reported amount for value-added and switching operations is negative, Toyota accounted
for its expenses of labor and overhead in its calculation. For further discussion of respondents' further processing
operations and the potential for negative value-added, refer to the discussion of TCM's further processing in Comment
20 below. 


Comment 17: 

Petitioners argue that Toyota's claimed credit revenue for its U.S. sales should be rejected because the credit revenue
for certain sales is actually earned on sales by unrelated dealers to end-user customers and not on the sale from Toyota
to the unrelated dealer. Petitioners state that Toyota sells forklifts in the United States to unrelated dealers
and that the first unrelated sale is the sale from Toyota to the dealer. Petitioners contend that the purpose of this
review, as stated in the questionnaire, is to examine sales by Toyota to the first unrelated customer. Petitioners
argue that credit revenue earned on sales from the unrelated dealer to the end-user, which are financed through TMCC,
is therefore irrelevant to this review, because the financing arranged by TMCC is a separate transaction from the
sale of the forklift. 
Toyota argues that TMCC retains both the title to, and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) interest in, the forklift
until TMCC receives payment from either the dealer or end-user. Toyota contends that a shift in the credit transaction
from the dealer to the end-user is no more than a shift in the source of payment. In both cases, TMCC retains ownership
and the UCC interest in the forklift. Because Toyota retains a direct relationship with the dealer or end-user, the
credit revenue is directly related to the sale of the forklift, and therefore, the credit transaction should be adjusted
for. Toyota further contends that its ability to sell forklifts is contingent upon its ability to encourage end-users
to buy forklifts. Toyota notes, for example, that the Department considers its subsidies of yellow page advertisements
for dealers a direct selling expense. Toyota's provision of favorable financing to end-users similarly is intended
to encourage end-user sales, which in turn create sales to dealers. Toyota concludes by noting that it would be unfair
and illogical to account for TMCC's credit expense and not its revenue. 


Department's Position: 

In accordance with section 353.41 of the Department's regulations, we used the price to the first unrelated purchaser
in the United States as the basis of U.S. price. Toyota's USP was based on the price TMS/TIE charged its unrelated dealers.
Therefore, we consider revenue generated as a result of the sale by the dealer to the end-user through a financing arrangement
a separate transaction, and as such, not directly associated with the sales under review, as claimed by Toyota. This
credit arrangement is unlike Toyota's subsidy for yellow pages advertisements, which is properly treated as a direct
selling expense. That TMCC retains both the title to, and the UCC interest in, the financed forklift until TMCC receives
the final payment from the end-user has no bearing on the calculation of USP. Finally, we note that, contrary to Toyota's
assertion, we are not accounting for TMCC's credit expense. We therefore disallowed the claimed adjustment for credit
revenue for the sales financed by the end-user. 


Comment 18: 

Petitioners contend that the Department should not have deducted Toyota's HM advertising costs as a direct selling
expense for PP comparisons. Petitioners contend that the Department should follow its practice in the first review
and treat these expenses as ISE. 
Toyota does not believe that the Department applied the correct legal test for determining whether these advertising
expenses are direct or indirect. Toyota submits that these expenses, incurred on behalf of Toyota's customers, are
direct and should therefore be deducted from FMV in PP comparisons. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. These advertising expenses are indirect because they are not directed at Toyota's customer's
customer. In the first administrative review, we determined that these advertising expenses were indirect selling
expenses. See Forklifts I, Comment 18. The data submitted in this proceeding is very similar to that submitted and
disproved during verification in the previous administrative review. We have no compelling evidence on the record
in this proceeding which indicates that the situation is any different from that found previously. We have therefore
continued to treat these HM expenses as ISE and have not deducted them from FMV in PP comparisons. 


Comment 19: 

Petitioners claim that Toyota failed to support adequately its claim concerning credit expenses incurred by Toyota
on PP sales. Petitioners state that, for reasons based on proprietary information, the claimed method of payment
used with respect to these sales is incorrect. Petitioners assert that, accordingly, the Department should use BIA
with respect to this expense for the final results. According to petitioners, the Department should also consider
associated bank charges in determining this BIA. Petitioners state that bank charges should be among several elements
considered in this BIA. Petitioners provide a calculation, using data from Toyota's ESP response, of the average
time between the date the forklifts were exported from Japan and the date the forklifts were imported into the United
States. Petitioners contend that this calculation represents the best method for imputing Toyota's credit expense
for PP sales. 
Toyota asserts that, because of the immediate payment term on PP sales, there is no credit expense, as concluded by
the Department in Forklifts LTFV and Forklifts I, which included two verifications. Toyota states that the Department
should not change its practice in this administrative review.

Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that reported credit expenses are incorrect. Although Toyota's PP sales are made on immediate
payment terms (immediate with respect to the date of delivery in the United States), Toyota still incurs some credit
expense on these transactions for the time between shipment and payment. An expense must therefore be imputed on PP
sales for the time between shipment from Japan and payment. Because entry dates are unavailable, we used the average
number of days between shipment and payment calculated by petitioners in their case brief. Petitioners' figure is
based on data provided by Toyota. However, we have no information on the record indicating that Toyota incurred bank
charge fees associated with the immediate payment PP sales and, thus, we cannot make an adjustment for such fees. 


Comments Specific to TCM 




Comment 20: 

TCM objects to the Department's allocation of selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) over U.S.
further manufacturing cost in cases involving ``swap-downs'' of masts (substitutions of low-value masts for masts
of higher value). In such situations, TCM has allocated a negative SG&A amount to further manufacturing. In the
Department's preliminary results ESP computer program, wherever a negative amount was reported for the further
manufacturing SG&A expense, this amount was multiplied by negative one in order to convert it to a positive value.
TCM claims that these negative amounts should not have been converted to positive amounts because the SG&A expenses
that were allocated to the import values were inflated so as to include an offset amount equal to the absolute value
of the negative value-added SG&A amounts. As a result, according to TCM, the amount of total U.S. SG&A deducted
from USP has been inflated well beyond the total actual expense incurred. TCM requests that the Department correct
this problem in the computer program so that only the actual SG&A expenses will be deducted from U.S. price. 
Petitioners argue that the Department should recalculate TCM's value-added using positive U.S. SG&A amounts
for those U.S. value-added sales where TCM listed negative SG&A amounts. Petitioners state that it is not possible
to have negative labor, factory overhead, or SG&A from value-added operations. Petitioners suggest applying
the highest reported SG&A amount to these sales as BIA or, in the alternative, assigning a positive value to all
SG&A expenses. 
Petitioners also argue that, despite the arguments in its brief, TCM has not offered support for its contention that
TCM allocated the total U.S. SG&A amount, plus an offsetting increase, to the truck as imported for those sales
where it allocated negative SG&A in further manufacturing. Petitioners also contend that there is insufficient
information (i.e., calculation of total SG&A, or identification of the field where the SG&A amount allocated
to the value of the truck as imported is recorded) on the record for the Department to verify TCM's claim. Finally, petitioners
claim that TCM's use in its case brief of a hypothetical_rather than an actual_example is not sufficient. Petitioners,
therefore, contend that the Department should continue to use the same methodology for allocating U.S. SG&A
to U.S. further manufacturing costs that was used for the preliminary results. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that it is not appropriate to attribute negative SG&A expenses to further processing
operations. However, in the preliminary results, our treatment of SG&A understated the value of TCM's imported
product and overstated TCM's value-added for those products for which TCM reported negative SG&A. As a result
of these over- and under-statements, we have decided not to follow the methodology employed in Forklifts I and in the
preliminary results of this review. 
Two facts must be considered in determining how to treat TCM's reported negative SG&A properly. First, the processing
that TCM undertook must result in the allocation of positive SG&A expenses both to the imported product and to
the further processing operations conducted by TCM. Second, the sum of the SG&A allocated to TCM's imported product
and TCM's value-added must be equal to the amount incurred. 

Therefore, we have allocated a portion of TCM's SG&A expenses to the COM of the further processing operations
and deducted this amount from USP. The COM of the further processing operations is the sum of the cost of all materials
added to the forklift truck, plus the labor and factory overhead costs incurred by TCM. The remaining SG&A amount,
which we attributed to the imported product, was not deducted. This allocation distributes the actual amount of SG&A
expense incurred between further manufacturing and the imported product. This methodology therefore results in
an allocation of positive SG&A to both the further manufacturing operations and the imported product. The amount
allocated to the imported product also does not exceed the amount incurred for the sale. 
To do this, we calculated on a sale-by-sale basis the factor represented by TCM's reported SG&A as a share of the
total reported manufacturing costs associated with further manufacturing (

i.e.

, positive and negative values). We then used this factor, which was always positive

1

, to generate an SG&A amount for each transaction by applying the factor only to the positive costs associated
with further manufacturing. We thereby guaranteed that the SG&A value attributed to further manufacturing
was always positive.

Under this methodology we succeed both in allocating an amount for SG&A expense equal to that incurred by TCM,
and in attributing a positive value for SG&A expenses to all TCM's further processing operations, 

i.e.

, including cases of ``swap-downs'' of masts (substitutions of low-value masts for masts of higher value). 





Comment 21

: TCM argues that, in the ESP program, for situations in which FMV is based on constructed value (CV), the Department
neglected to deduct direct selling expenses from FMV. TCM argues that such an adjustment is in accordance with the
Department's longstanding practice. TCM cites section 772(e) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.41(e); Tapered Roller
Bearings from Japan (52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987); Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan (50 FR
45447, October 31, 1987); and Spun Acrylic Yarn from Italy (50 FR 35849, September 4, 1985). 



Petitioners assert that the Department must first define the direct selling expenses variable before a COS adjustment
can be made, noting that the variable was not defined in either the Department's January 29, 1992 ESP program or in a
memorandum dated February 5, 1992. Petitioners claim that, if the direct selling expenses variable is not defined,
neither the respondent nor petitioners will be able to verify that the correct COS adjustments were made. 





Department's Position

: We agree with TCM. We were satisfied with the respondent's reporting of direct and indirect selling expenses as submitted.
Therefore, we have made a COS adjustment using the direct selling expenses variable. 





Comment 22

: TCM argues that the Department incorrectly accounted for credit income earned on U.S. sales in PP comparisons. According
to TCM, the Department added credit income earned on U.S. sales to both USP and FMV, despite the fact that credit income
is realized on U.S. sales only. Accordingly, TCM requests that the Department revise its calculations to eliminate
the addition to FMV of credit income earned on U.S. sales for these final results.





Department's Position

: We agree with TCM and have eliminated the addition of credit income to FMV for these final results. 





Comment 23

: Petitioners argue that verification of TCM's cost data is necessary because this data has never been verified. Petitioners
state that TCM's cost data was neither verified in the investigation, because the cost data was not accepted, nor in
the first administrative review, due to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War. Petitioners assert that good cause for
verification still exists and is shown by petitioners' April 9, 1991 letter to the Department, which petitioners
claim documents extensive discrepancies in TCM's unverified cost data. Accordingly, petitioners claim that the
Department should conduct verification of TCM's cost information prior to issuing its final results. 



TCM replies that the Department is not required to conduct verification of TCM's COP data in this review. According
to TCM, the Department is required to conduct verification in an administrative review only if an interested party
files a timely request for verification and if the Department has not conducted a verification during the two immediately
preceding reviews. TCM also notes that the Department is not required to verify all sections of a respondent's questionnaire
response. In this context, TCM argues that the Department satisfied these requirements in the previous review by
conducting verification of TCM's HM and U.S. sales, and further manufacturing expenses. Because the Department
was able to verify TCM's information in the previous review, TCM argues that no further verification is necessary
in this review. 





Department's Position

: With respect to administrative reviews, the Department is required to verify information under section 776(b)(3)
of the Tariff Act if the Secretary concludes that good cause for verification exists, or if a timely request for verification
is received from an interested party and the Department has not conducted a verification during either of the two immediately
preceding administrative reviews. The current administrative review is the second review of the antidumping order
in this case. Thus, verification is not required under section 776(b)(3) of the Act. TCM's HM sales, U.S. sales and
U.S. costs, including value-added cost data from TCM's related facilities in the United States, were verified in
the previous administrative review. The Department determined that TCM's data reporting methodology was sound
and reliable. 



Because verification was not required and all other aspects of TCM's sales were successfully verified in the previous
review, because our analysis of TCM's response did not indicate any significant discrepancies, and because petitioners
did not make a compelling case that TCM's data was seriously flawed, we determined that presently there was no good
cause to verify TCM's submitted cost data. 





Comment 24

: Petitioners argue that for the final results, the Department should revise the method it used to adjust for commissions
on TCM's sales. For PP transactions, petitioners submit that the commission offset rule directs the Department to
reduce USP by the lesser of the HM commission or U.S. ISE when commissions are paid in one market and not in the other.
Petitioners contend that TCM failed to report ISE for its PP sales and that the Department should accordingly deny
the commissions claimed by TCM for its HM sales.

With respect to ESP transactions, petitioners state that the preliminary margin program incorrectly deducted all
HM commissions from HM price and all U.S. commissions from USP. Petitioners state that commissions should be deducted
from both home market price and U.S. price only with respect to ESP comparisons that include a commission in both transactions.




TCM responds that the special rule governing commission offsets does not require that commissions be paid on every
sale in both markets. Rather, TCM contends that this rule applies only when no commissions are paid on any sales in one
of the markets under consideration. Because TCM pays commissions on certain sales in both markets, TCM concludes
that the Department should continue to treat commissions as direct selling expenses in both the U.S. and home markets,
and thereby not employ the offset rule in comparisons in which commissions are incurred in only one transaction. 





Department's Position

: Petitioners' assertion that TCM failed to report U.S. ISE on PP transactions is incorrect. For the final results,
we modified our PP computer program to deduct HM commissions from FMV and then offset them by adding U.S. ISE up to the
amount of the HM commissions. 



With regard to ESP sales, we agree with petitioners to the extent that the mere existence of commissions on some sales
in both markets does not automatically preclude the use of the offset rule. Our standard practice requires that for
comparisons involving ESP for which a commission is incurred in both markets, we deduct the U.S. commission from ESP
and the HM commission from FMV. For comparisons in which there is a commission paid in one market and none in the other
market, we offset the commission with ISE incurred in the other market, to the extent of the lesser of the commission
in the one market or the ISE in the other. In order to follow this standard practice, we have modified our ESP computer
program for the final results because, in our preliminary results calculations, we did not offset the commission
with ISE for comparisons in which a commission was paid in one market and not in the other. 





Comment 25

: Petitioners contend that TCM's HM commission sales are outside the ordinary course of trade because they were unusual
and infrequent, as stated by TCM in its June 24, 1991 questionnaire response. Petitioners argue that the Department
should accordingly exclude TCM's HM commission sales from FMV. 





Department's Position

: We disagree that TCM's HM commission sales are outside the ordinary course of trade. TCM paid commissions to both
related and unrelated dealers on TCM's sales to end-users. Although sales to end-users constitute a very small portion
of TCM's HM sales, and are included as comparison models, these end-users are TCM's usual commercial customers. As
a result, we consider them to be in the ordinary course of trade. 





Comment 26

: Petitioners contend that HM transactions that have shipment dates prior to March 1, 1989 are not within the relevant
reporting period (March 1, 1989 to July 31, 1990) and therefore should be disregarded for comparison purposes. Petitioners
note that the questionnaire states that ``[t]here can be no new dates of sale after shipment and any subsequent price
modifications must be reported as either a rebate or a discount.'' Petitioners further contend that TCM's response
supports the use of shipment date as the appropriate date of sale, because it states that the date of sale is equivalent
to the estimated date of receipt by the customer. In the interests of consistency, petitioners also suggest matching
U.S. sales to HM sales on the basis of shipment dates. 



In response, TCM argues that the date of sale, rather than the date of shipment, determines the reporting period for
HM sales. TCM further argues that, in accordance with Department practice, TCM reported as the date of sale the date
on which the parties were bound by the terms of sales. Because TCM followed the Department's requirements in determining
dates of sale and reporting HM sales, and because the Department did not request from TCM additional information regarding
sale dates, TCM concludes that the Department should not revise its reporting requirements for HM dates of sale.





Department's Position

: We agree with petitioners. Any given sale cannot have a date of sale later than the date of shipment to the customer.
Any adjustments to price or quantity that take place after the date of shipment must be reported as discounts or rebates,
in the case of changes in price, or quantity adjustments in the case of changes in quantity. 



We have therefore used the HM date of shipment as the date of sale instead of the date of delivery, which TCM reported
as the date of sale. We analyzed these HM shipment dates in order to determine whether they met our criterion for contemporaneity
with regard to matching to the U.S. sale dates. We found that all but two of TCM's proposed matches were suitably contemporaneous,
and that these transactions were only used for matching with two ESP sales. We assigned these two sales the weighted-average
dumping margin calculated for ESP sales. 





Comment 27

: Petitioners claim that TCM failed to include the G&A expenses of one of its related subsidiaries, C. Itoh Industrial
Machinery Inc. (CIM). Petitioners state that TCM calculated a G&A factor for U.S. ISE but failed to apply this
factor to the selling price and, therefore, did not include an amount for the G&A portion of U.S. selling expenses
in its reported sale-by-sale ISE.

TCM responds that it reported the expenses in question in accordance with the Department's instructions. According
to TCM, it initially reported all SG&A expenses that it incurred in the United States as either direct or indirect
selling expenses. The Department subsequently requested, however, that TCM segregate G&A from selling expenses,
and allocate the G&A expenses to TCM's U.S. further processing operations. Thus, TCM asserts that petitioners'
argument is incorrect because the expenses in question are included, at the Department's request, in TCM's further
manufacturing submissions. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. The G&A expenses in question pertain to all of TCM's U.S. sales of subject merchandise,
regardless of whether the merchandise is further processed in the United States. Because these G&A expenses
are applicable to all U.S. sales, we have included them in our calculation of U.S. ISE for these final results. 



Comment 28: 

Petitioners claim that there are two errors in the U.S. ISE that TCM reported for sales by another related subsidiary,
Mitsui Machinery Distribution, Inc. (MMD). First, petitioners claim that sale-by-sale ISE shown in TCM's sales
listing does not reconcile with the formula provided by TCM (ISE factor x net price). In particular, petitioners state
that the amounts reported for certain ESP sales are lower than the amount that results from applying the formula. Petitioners
request that the Department recalculate this expense using the formula provided by TCM. 

Second, petitioners claim that TCM failed to report an amount for MMD's G&A in TCM's reported ISE. Petitioners
request that the Department allocate a portion of the ``General G&A'' reported by TCM to MMD's forklift truck
sales to derive a G&A ratio for MMD, then multiply this factor by net sales price for each of MMD's sales to compute
G&A expenses for each sale. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that TCM did not calculate a G&A factor for MMD. We have corrected this omission using
the factor, calculated using TCM's data, provided by petitioners in their case brief because this factor offers a
reasonable estimate of MMD's G&A expenses. 

We disagree that TCM failed to calculate properly the amounts reported for ISE on MMD's sales. In reviewing petitioners'
Attachment 4 to the case brief, we found that petitioners included an incorrect amount for dealer inspection/prep
charge and that petitioners did not, as TCM's sample calculation showed, allocate a portion of the ISE to U.S. value-added.
After adjusting petitioners' calculations in Attachment 4 to account for the correct dealer inspection/prep charge
and the ISE reported in U.S. value-added, we found that for the calculations sampled, the results matched the amounts
calculated and reported by TCM. 



Comment 29: 

Petitioners argue that for two sales, TCM did not recalculate, as requested by the Department in its supplemental
questionnaire, certain value-added costs. Therefore, petitioners assert that the Department should use the highest
costs reported by TCM for these expense categories as BIA. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. For the final results, we used the highest costs reported by TCM for these expense categories
as BIA. 



Comment 30: 

Petitioners contend that TCM's brokerage expenses are understated because the brokerage allocation factor (total
brokerage costs for U.S. forklift sales divided by total revenue from U.S. forklift sales) was multiplied by transfer
price instead of sales price. Petitioners request that the Department recalculate this expense by multiplying the
brokerage factor by sales price. 

TCM replies that the total revenue over which it allocated brokerage expenses was the revenue of TCM's factory in Japan,
which represents the aggregate of all TCM's transfer prices. Because it calculated its brokerage expense factor
by allocating brokerage expenses over transfer prices, TCM argues that it is appropriate to calculate per-unit brokerage
expenses by multiplying this expense factor by TCM's reported transfer prices. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with TCM. We find TCM's allocation method for calculating Japanese brokerage charges to be reasonable. TCM
calculated a factor by dividing total Japanese brokerage paid on its exports of forklift trucks to the United States
by the total transfer prices (revenue recorded by the factory at Shiga) of the forklifts exported to the United States.
Because the Japanese brokerage charges would have been paid on the basis of the transfer price, it is reasonable that
TCM would use this in the denominator of the allocation equation. 



Comment 31: 

Petitioners state that TCM failed to report the actual trading company expense incurred for one sale. Petitioners
contend that the Department should treat this expense as a movement expense, in accordance with the first review,
and should assign the highest reported trading company markup as BIA for this observation. 

TCM argues that petitioners misunderstand TCM's method for calculating trading company markups. According to TCM,
it pays trading companies a single fee that includes movement expenses incurred by the trading companies and the trading
companies' markup. In its response, TCM separately reported the movement expenses and the markup; the total of these
items represented the single fee that TCM paid to the trading company. In those instances in which the trading company
markup is negative, the actual movement expenses incurred by the trading company exceed the fee that the trading company
receives from TCM; thus, the negative markup reported by TCM is a downward adjustment to actual movement expenses,
paid by the trading company, to reflect the amount paid by TCM. Because TCM's reporting method is accurate and is based
on actual expenses, TCM asserts that the use of BIA is unwarranted. Should the Department determine to reject TCM's
negative trading company markup, TCM requests that the Department set any negative amounts equal to zero, in order
to reflect the actual movement expenses incurred by the trading companies. 



Department's Position: 

As in the first review, we treated the trading company markups as a movement charge. The appropriate deduction to USP
for inland freight is the expense incurred by TCM. Because the addition of the negative markup yields the actual expense
incurred by TCM for this sale, we have, for the final results, recalculated inland freight using TCM's submitted data.

Comment 32: 

Petitioners contend that interest income claimed by TCM from long-term installment sales may have been earned on
sales from TCM's unrelated dealers to end-users rather than on sales from TCM to its dealers, and as such should not
be added to the price of TCM's sales. Petitioners assert that installment sales are generally sales to end-users rather
than to dealers. In addition, petitioners claim that TCM did not properly justify the interest rate it used in calculating
this income. 

TCM argues that the credit income at issue is earned by TCM itself, not by its dealers. TCM further argues that such income
is a legitimate increase to U.S. price, because it is agreed to by the customer at the time of sale. Therefore, TCM claims
that the Department should continue to add credit income to U.S. price for the final results. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with petitioners. Concerning the issue of whether the installment sales in question were made by TCM to
its unrelated dealers, as opposed to sales from the dealers to end-users, we have not found any evidence that these
transactions did not concern sales by TCM to its dealers. We also do not have any evidence that TCM did not collect the
credit income that it has reported, regardless of the interest rate that it charged. Therefore we have continued to
add credit income to USP for the final results. 



Comment 33: 

Petitioners, citing Color Picture Tubes from Korea (52 FR 44186, November 18, 1987), contend that TCM's U.S. advertising
expenses are direct selling expenses because the advertisements are aimed at a purchaser who buys the merchandise
from the first unrelated purchaser or from a subsequent purchaser, 

i.e.

, the customer's customer. Petitioners further contend that a TCM advertisement submitted as Exhibit 6 of petitioners'
case brief is proof that these expenses are direct advertising expenses because the advertisement: (1) specifically
promotes internal-combustion forklifts subject to this review; (2) identifies TCM Manufacturing, USA, Inc., TCM
America, Inc., and C. Itoh Industrial Machinery, Inc., as the source of the advertisement; and (3) does not refer to
or promote specific TCM dealers. 

Petitioners submit that TCM failed to support its claim that all of its U.S. advertisements were indirect selling
expenses and state that the Department should therefore reject TCM's claim and treat all of the advertising expenses
as direct expenses. Petitioners provide calculations for allocating this expense as a direct selling expense to
forklifts sold through CIM and to forklifts sold through MMD. 

In rebuttal, TCM argues that the only advertising expenses related to subject merchandise were for general corporate
advertising, rather than advertising for specific products. TCM further argues that the advertising cited by petitioner
does not relate to subject merchandise, because it concerns forklift trucks manufactured in the United States. Because
TCM's advertising is either intended to promote the company as a whole, or is not related to forklift trucks produced
in Japan, TCM concludes that the Department should treat TCM's U.S. advertising expenses as indirect selling expenses.




Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that these expenses are direct selling expenses because these advertisements, as evident
from the examples submitted by TCM, are aimed at the ultimate consumer. We disagree with TCM regarding TCM's claim
that the advertising in question is unrelated to subject merchandise because the trucks sold by TCM in the United States
were in fact manufactured in Japan, and were, at most, customized through further processing in the United States.
Therefore, we have treated these advertising expenses as a direct selling expense in the final results. 



Final Results of Review 



We determine the following percentage margins to exist for the period June 1, 1989 through May 31, 1990: 







The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual
differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions concerning all respondents directly to the Customs Service. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative
review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, as provided
by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be the rates as listed
above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue
to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; and (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered by
this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will
be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise. 

The cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 39.45 percent. On May 25, 1993, the CIT in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-79 and 

Federal Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty order for the purposes of
establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping
findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department
has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative
review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation)
as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative
reviews. 

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 39.45 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the amended final notice of the LTFV investigation
by the Department (53 FR 20882, June 7, 1988). 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely
written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby
requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 

This administrative review and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order
on deformed steel concrete reinforcing bar from Peru.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On November 19, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 61069) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on deformed steel concrete reinforcing bar from Peru
(50 FR 48819; November 27, 1985).
Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested
parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests
an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. 
On December 3, 1993, Florida Steel Corporation and Chaparral Steel Co., domestic producers and petitioners in the
original investigation, objected to our intent to revoke the order. Accordingly, the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii)
have not been met, and we will not revoke the order. 
This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Program Interest. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, desires to encourage the submission of unsolicited
proposals in support of the Department's Minority Technical Education Program. Such support is authorized by 42
U.S.C. 7141 (d) and 7256(a); Public Law 95-619, part 3, sec. 2.11(d), which states that the Director of the Office
of Minority Economic Impact may provide appropriate assistance to minority educational institutions to enable
these institutions to participate in the activities of the Department. It is intended in particular to obtain proposals
from post secondary two-year educational institutions, or from teams of organizations including qualified post
secondary two-year educational institutions. For purposes of this solicitation, a qualified ``Minority Education
Institution'' is a post secondary two-year educational institution of higher learning (such as a community college
or vocational college) that is a non-profit entity with a minimum of 25 percent total minority enrollment. Pursuant
to Public Law 95-619, ``Minority'' means any individual who is a citizen of the United States and who is a Negro,
American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent. This notice describes
the principal scope of the activity and provides some guidance on submitting proposals. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
With this notice, it is DOE's intent to encourage the submission of proposals for minority two year post secondary
training that would address the following program objectives: 



1. Increase the number of minority students that select a course of study leading to energy-related careers to enable
and encourage them to bridge from high school to community college to four year educational institutions; and/or,
increase the career opportunities through retention programs, retraining, and bridge programs in energy related
careers. 

2. Strengthen the quantity and quality of energy-related technical and academic curricula with emphasis on applied
training provided for minority students at two-year post secondary schools. 

3. Establish partnerships with industry and other community entities that promote economic growth opportunities
of the community serviced by enriching energy-related technology transfer activities. 

The purpose of this notice is to encourage the submission of proposals that address one or more of the following: 

1. Provide financial assistance to financially needy honor students participating in the program.

Tucson Electric Power Co.; Application for Rescission of a Prohibition Order Issued Pursuant to the Powerplant and
Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Fossil Energy, Department of Energy. 
 


 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application to rescind Prohibition Order. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Tucson Electric Power Company has requested that DOE rescind a Fuel Use Act Prohibition Order issued to electric generating
units at its Irvington Generating Station located near Tucson, Arizona. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE) has received an application by Tucson Electric Power
Company (TEP) to rescind the Prohibition Order issued on July 15, 1981 (46 FR 37960, July 23, 1981), pursuant to the
Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) 42 U.S.C. 8301 

et seq. 

The order prohibited the burning of oil or natural gas in TEP's Irvington Generating Station Units 1, 2 and 3, located
near Tucson, Arizona. 
 
 


Pursuant to 10 CFR 501.102(b), TEP filed its application based on a substantial change in the circumstances upon which
the Prohibition Order was originally issued. TEP claims this change in circumstances to be beyond its control. TEP
cites the sharp reduction in economic benefits to be realized from the conversion to coal and the potentially costly
environmental disincentives to using coal, combined with TEP's financial situation, as the impetus for the requested
relief. TEP requests rescission to permit the company to continue to use oil or natural gas above the percentage limits
specified in the prohibition order. 
 


Procedural Matters 
 


Any party or person desiring to be heard or to protect this application for rescission should file five copies of any
comments, petitions to intervene, or protests at the address provided above. Any request for a public hearing must
be made within the public comment period. In making its decision regarding the requested rescission action, DOE will
consider all relevant information submitted or otherwise available to it. 
 
The public file containing a copy of the application and other documents and supporting materials on this proceeding
is available, upon request, at the address above.

Questar proposes to abandon its Huntington District Regulator Station (HU0005 DRS) located adjacent to its six-inch
Jurisdictional Lateral (J.L.) No. 44 located in Emery County, Utah, used in conjunction with providing gas service
to Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), Questar's local distribution company affiliate. Questar states
that the facilities to be abandoned at the HU0005 DRS comprise approximately 100 feet of three, four and six-inch piping
and one pressure regulating valve assembly. Questar states that the investment associated with the facilities to
be abandoned is $15,129. Questar states that because these facilities function solely to reduce delivery pressures
for individual downstream sales and transportation delivery meter stations, no actual deliveries were made directly
through these facilities. Questar states that following abandonment, the 3-inch Huntington Tap will remain in service.
Questar states that because Mountain Fuel will continue to deliver to its customers via individual meter and regulating
stations along the length of J.L. No. 44, there will be no abandonment of gas service to Mountain Fuel or its customers
as a result of granting it permission to abandon the HU0005 DRS.

Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC
Gas Tariff, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A to the filing, to become effective March 1, 1994.

Southern states that the tariff sheets reflect an anticipated reduction in the level of firm service from its customer,
Atlanta Gas Light Company, and a reduced level of jurisdictional revenues from the level established under the compliance
filing in Docket No. RS92-10.

Southern states that it has continued to employ the Straight Fixed Variable method for cost classification, cost
allocation and rate design and has utilized the mitigation methods required by the Commission in its Order of September
3, 1993. In order to prevent a significant increase to Southern's remaining firm customers as a result of the reduced
firm service entitlements Southern proposes to (1) design IT rates based on a 75% load factor basis, (2) charge separately
for injections and withdrawals into the Contract Storage Service (CSS) and the ANR Storage Service, and (3) revise
the allocation methodology for the ANR Storage Service to reflect the use of contract demands for allocating costs
to this incremental service.

Southern requests waiver of the five-month suspension period in order to allow the proposed tariff sheets to become
effective March 1, 1994, the date the anticipated reduced service levels will become effective.

Southern states that copies of the filing were served upon all of Southern's jurisdictional purchasers, shippers
and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214

implementation of restructured pipeline services under Order No. 636, et seq. Southern states that the tariff sheets
identified below were filed in compliance with the Commission's orders in Southern's restructuring proceeding

of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1:

First Revised Second Revised Sheet No. 17
First Revised Second Revised Sheet No. 18
Second Revised Sheet No. 29
Second Revised Sheet No. 30

been paid or incurred by Southern since the filing on December 1, 1993 of its first GSR cost recovery filing in Docket
No. RP94-67-000. Southern states that it sets forth in this filing the revised demand surcharges and revised
interruptible rates that will be charged in connection with its recovery of GSR costs associated with the reformation
of additional gas supply contracts that have become unnecessary and/or unmarketable as a result of the receipt by
Southern of revised service elections from its customers following the mandatory restructuring by Southern of its
pipeline services under Order No. 636. Southern requests that the tariff sheets be made effective on February 1, 1994.
Southern states that it seeks to recover $53.8 million in GSR costs which has been paid or incurred in connection with
the reformation of two gas supply contracts. Southern states that these GSR costs have arisen as a direct result of
the need to realign gas supply contracts following customers' elections during restructuring to terminate their
sales entitlements under Order No. 636. Southern further states that none of the GSR costs sought to be recovered in
the instant filing constitute take-or-pay settlement costs under gas supply contracts existing at March 31, 1989
which would be subject to the provisions of Southern's 1988 take-or-pay settlement in Docket No. RP86-63-000.
Southern states that copies of the filing were served upon Southern's jurisdictional customers and interested state
commissions.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal

FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, revised tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing, to be effective
February 1, 1994.
Viking states that the purpose of this filing is to make several miscellaneous tariff modifications to reflect the
acquisition of Viking's stock by Northern States Power Company and changes in personnel, addresses and telephone
numbers occasioned by that acquisition. In addition, Viking proposes to: (1) Change the time for commencement of
the gas day from 8 a.m. to 12:00 noon; (2) establish a minimum delivery threshold for the installation of electronic
measurement equipment; (3) delete the PGA clause from its tariff, as no longer required; (4) eliminate references
to Order No. 497 that are no longer appropriate in view of the Commission's recent finding that Viking is currently
not subject to Order No. 497 (see East Tennessee Natural Gas Co., et al., Dockets Nos. MG91-4-001 et al.,
65 FERC Paragraph 61,389 (December 23, 1993), mimeo at 39-40); (5) delete a reference to common operating personnel
with Viking's former affiliate, Minnesota Intrastate Transmission System; (6) change the governing law in its pro-forma
service agreements from Texas to Minnesota; and (7) revise the index of shippers to reflect contract modifications
occasioned by implementation of Order No. 636. Finally, Viking has modified its tariff to correct several miscellaneous
typographical errors.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January
11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference
room.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>



January 5, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for
review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-0276. Persons wishing
to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.






Please note: 

The Commission has requested expedited OMB review of this item by January 7, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18.






OMB Number: 

None.



Title: 

Implementation of sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, GN Docket No. 93-252, First Report and Order.



Action: 

New collection.



Respondents: 

Individuals or households, state or local governments, federal agencies or employees, non-profit institutions
and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).



Frequency of Response: 

One time filing requirement due by February 10, 1994.



Estimated Annual Burden: 

50 responses; 2 hours average burden per response; 100 hours total annual burden.



Needs and Uses: 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103-66, title VI, section 6002(b), 107 Stat. 312,
395 (1993), amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to
create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private
land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees and will be treated
as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of section 310(b) of the Communications
Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, in new section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waivers
of section 310(b) to private land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present
action clarifies the filing procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees
of the February 10, 1994 filing deadline. The Commission will use the waiver petitions to determine whether each given
petitioner should be permitted to retain foreign ownership or control, pursuant to statute.

<DOCTITLE>Manufacture of in Vitro Diagnostic Products; Current Good Manufacturing Practice Final Guideline; Availability</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a final guideline entitled ``Guideline
for the Manufacture of In Vitro Diagnostic Products'' that contains production practices which are acceptable to
FDA for assuring the safety and effectiveness of in vitro diagnostic products. Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic
products may find the information in the guideline useful in developing procedures that comply with the current good
manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for these products. A draft document was previously made available for
public comment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA first announced the availability for public comment of the draft guideline in the 

Federal Register

 of April 7, 1988 (53 FR 11561). In that same issue of the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 11561), FDA announced the forthcoming meeting of the agency's Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory
Committee (the committee). As a result of the notice and the open public meeting, FDA received 17 letters providing
comments_14 from manufacturers, 2 from trade associations, and 1 from an attorney representing a manufacturer.
Presentations before the committee by industry and FDA resulted in committee recommendations that the agency: (1)
Continue to handle the document as a guideline; (2) change the title and/or scope of the document to clarify which products
are subject to the guideline; and (3) extend the comment period from June 6, 1988 to July 15, 1988.


FDA extended the comment period as recommended by the committee and revised the guideline based on the comments received.
A notice of availability of the second draft was published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 19, 1990 (55 FR 14863).
Since release of the second draft, four letters of comment have been received from two trade associations, one manufacturer,
and one user association. Meetings have also been held with the two trade associations_the Association of Microbiological
Diagnostic Manufacturers and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. A total of 21 letters of comment were
received in response to all notices. These comments are on file with the Dockets Management Branch under Docket No.
88D-0087.
The notice of availability of the draft guideline stated that it would be issued under  10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)),
which provides for the use of guidelines to establish procedures or standards of general applicability that are not
legal requirements but that are acceptable to the agency. The agency is now in the process of considering whether to
revise 
 10.90(b). Although that decision has not been made, the agency has decided to publish this guideline. However,
this notice and the final guideline are not being issued under the authority of  10.90(b), and the final guideline,
although called a guideline, does not operate to bind FDA or any other person in any way. The agency advises that this
final guideline represents its current position on the requirements of the CGMP regulations for in vitro diagnostic
products. The guideline may be useful to manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products. A person may also choose to
use alternate procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to depart from
the practices and procedures set forth in the final guideline, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with
the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable
by FDA. This guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits
for or on any person.
On November 23, 1993 (58 FR 61952), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the medical device CGMP regulations.
Any revisions to the CGMP regulations may result in the need for changes to this guideline. Therefore, on issuing a
final rule to revise the CGMP regulations, FDA will review the guideline and make any necessary changes.
Copies of this final guideline, along with previous drafts and submitted comments, are available for public examination
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). 
Interested persons may submit written comments on the final guideline to the Dockets Management Branch. Additional
comments will be considered in determining the future need for amending the final guideline. Two copies of comments
should be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments should be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document.

Wyoming Wind Energy Project; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to conduct scoping for the U.S. Windpower,
Wyoming Wind Energy Project, Carbon County, Wyoming.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as amended, the Bureau of Land Management,
Rawlins District Office, will direct the preparation of an EIS on the potential impacts of a proposed wind energy project.
A total of 1,390 wind turbines and associated facilities will be constructed on 62,000 acres (25,091 hectares) of
private, Federal and state lands over a 10-12 year development period in Carbon County, Wyoming. The EIS will
be prepared by a third party contractor. If the project is approved, the BLM will issue a Right-of-Way Grant under section
501 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

U.S. Windpower proposes to construct a 500 megawatt (MW) Wind Energy Project to be located on Foote Creek Rim and Simpson
Ridge in Carbon County, Wyoming. The project area is located approximately 40 miles (64.35 Km) southeast of Rawlins
and 40 miles (64.36 Km) northwest of Laramie, Wyoming. The Foote Creek Rim portion is in all or portions of approximately
10 sections in Townships 19N and 20N, Ranges 78W and 79W north and west of Arlington. Access to the Foote Creek Rim site
is from I-80 and State Highway 13. The Simpson Ridge portion is in all or portions of 92 sections in Townships 20N,
21N, and 22N, Ranges 80W and 81W, south of Hanna. Access to the Simpson Ridge portion is from I-80 and State Highway
287 and State Highway 72. Land ownership in the project area is approximately 62% private, 28% Public (administered
by BLM), and 10% State of Wyoming. 




The project will be constructed in phases over a 10-12 year period. The first phase, involving 75 MW of electrical
power generated by approximately 215 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs), would be constructed on Foote Creek Rim in 1995-96.
Later phases would involve 50MW (approximately 75 WTGs/50 MW) increases per year, as utility contracts are approved,
until the 500 MW capacity is reached (for a total of 1,390 WTGs). Ancillary facilities include, but are not limited
to: above and below-ground electric and communication lines, access roads, substations, control/maintenance
building and transformer sites. The Bonneville Power Administration, Department of Energy, a Cooperating Agency
for the EIS, will execute a power output contract to purchase 25 MW of electricity from the project under element 2b
of BPA's Resource Supply Expansion Program. The Foote Creek Rim phase of the project would meet this requirement.

The wind turbines will be erected on 80 to 120 ft (24 to 37 m) lattice towers with height determined by specific meteorological
and geographic characteristics. The WTGs are variable speed, up-wind, three-fiberglass-bladed machines with
a rotor diameter of 108 ft (33 m). The WTGs will be spaced approximately 162 to 216 ft (49 to 66 m) apart with approximately
1,080 to 1,620 ft (329 to 494 m) between each row. 

Two potential electrical utility interconnections are proposed. The first is with the PacifiCorp 230 kV system at
the Miner's substation at Hanna, WY. A wood pole 230 kV line would be erected from the project site northwest, approximately
25 mi (40 Km), to the Miner's substation. The second proposed interconnection would be with the Western Area Power
Administration's parallel 115 kV lines at a site in T21N, R77W, Sec. 34. A transmission line of approximately 7 mi (11
Km) would extend from the project site northeast to the proposed tap substation.

 Notice of availability of Fort Greely Proposed Resource Management Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement.

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-606), the Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Land Management, Steese/White Mountains District has prepared a Proposed Resource Management Plan (PRMP)/Final
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Fort Greely military withdrawal, which is located near Delta Junction,
Alaska, southeast of Fairbanks. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division (Light) assisted in drafting the plan. The
document addresses planning for nonmilitary use of the withdrawal. It addresses questions such as access, recreation,
timber and fuel wood harvesting, and wildlife habitat and cultural resource protection. Although mining is discussed,
none would be allowed in the immediate future because of potential conflicts with the military's mission. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The PRMP/FEIS is available by contacting Jim Ducker at the address or phone number listed above. 



The Proposed Plan refines the Preferred Alternative presented in the Draft Resource Management Plan/Draft Environmental
Impact Statement (DRMP/DEIS). These refinements are the result of comments from the public and the availability
of information developed since the distribution of the draft. 


The PRMP/FEIS describes the Proposed Plan and its impacts in full and presents summaries of five alternatives and
their impacts. Complete descriptions of the alternatives and their impacts can be found in the DRMP/DEIS which are
available at the main public libraries in Fairbanks, Delta Junction, and Anchorage, and at the Steese/White Mountains
District Office in Fairbanks and the Alaska State Office in Anchorage.

Passenger Operations by Mexican Motor Carriers_Implementation of North American Free Trade Agreement 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of policy statement. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this Notice is to announce implementation of the provisions of the first phase of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) relating to land transportation. Effective January 1, 1994, the Commission will accept
and process applications by Mexican passenger carriers for operating authority to provide charter and tour bus service
across the United States-Mexico International Border line into the United States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (codified at 49 U.S.C. 10922(l)) imposed a 2-year moratorium (subject
to renewal) on the Commission's issuance of new grants of operating authority to motor carriers domiciled in or owned
or controlled by persons of Mexico or Canada. Under this statute, the President has the authority to remove or modify
the moratorium if he determines it to be in the national interest, that is, if overriding economic or foreign policy
considerations make such an action advisable, or if a negotiated settlement with one country or the other can be reached.
Under the moratorium, the President must notify the Congress in writing 60 days before the date on which the removal
or modification is to take effect. 



Shortly after it went into effect, the President exercised his authority and removed the moratorium with respect
to Canada. The President indicated in a memorandum to the United States Trade Representative that the United States
and Canada had reached a bilateral understanding that would ensure fair and equitable treatment for both U.S. and
Mexican motor carriers on both sides of the International Boundary line. 47 FR 54053. 

The moratorium remained in place for Mexican motor carriers because the Mexican Government continued to restrict
U.S. motor carriers' access to Mexico. Under the terms of the statute, the President extended the moratorium for 2-year
periods in 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990, and, most recently, in 1992. On November 3, 1993, however, in a Statement of Administrative
Action, the President gave notice to Congress that he would lift the moratorium with respect to Mexican charter and
other tour services on NAFTA's effective date, that is, on January 1, 1994.
 





Under NAFTA, the moratorium will be lifted in phases.
 The schedule of liberalization is as follows: 





1. Upon entry into force of NAFTA, for access by Mexican charter and tour bus operators; 

2. Three years after signature of NAFTA, for access by Mexican motor property carriers into United States border States,
and for establishing companies to distribute international cargo within the United States; 

3. Three years after entry into force, for access by Mexican regular-route passenger carriers; 

4. Six years after entry into force, access for cross-border operations by Mexican motor property carriers.

In Phase 1 of NAFTA, Mexican domiciled or owned or controlled passenger carriers may now apply for authority under
49 U.S.C. 10922(c) to transport passengers in charter and tour bus service in the United States in foreign commerce,
that is, the service must begin or end in Mexico (or Canada). Wholly domestic interstate operations in the United States
cannot be authorized or permitted.

NAFTA authorizes the granting of authority for charter operations and tour bus service only. By statute, we may authorize
motor common carriers of passengers to operate over either regular or irregular routes, but irregular-route services
must be limited to charter and special operations. Regular-route operations ordinarily involve the expeditious
transportation of passengers between fixed termini, over defined routes and according to established schedules.
Charter operations, on the other hand, ordinarily contemplate providing transportation for a group, assembled
by someone other than the carrier, which group contracts for the exclusive use of certain equipment for the duration
of a particular trip or tour. Generally, a flat rate for the use of the vehicle is charged, on either a ``mileage'' or
an ``hourly'' basis, and the passengers travel together for the entire trip.

As we recognized most recently in Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc._Adirondack Trailways, 8 I.C.C.2d 330, 334 n.5 (1992),
special operations originally were described as services rendered (generally on weekends, holidays, or other special
occasions) to a number of passengers that the carrier itself has assembled into a travel group through its own sales
of a ticket to each individual passenger covering a particular trip or tour. Fordham Bus Corp. Common Carrier Application,
29 M.C.C. 293, 297 (1941). In 

Asbury Park-N.Y. Transit Corp. 

v. 

Bingler Vacation Tours, 

62 M.C.C. 731, 740 (1954) (

Bingler

), aff'd sub nom. 

Bingler Vacation Tours 

v. 

United States

, 132 F. Supp. 793 (D. N.J. 1955), aff'd per curiam, 350 U.S. 921 (1955), though, the Commission adopted the position
that ``special operations'' is a catchall classification, which may include almost anything that is neither charter
operations nor the usual operations of a regular-route carrier.

Accordingly, ``tour service'' is only one form of special operations, as the Commission discussed in Passenger Transportation
in Special Operations, 112 M.C.C. 160, 165-67, 171-74 (1970), which clearly distinguishes the requirements
of ``tour service'' from those of ordinary special operations. Thus, under the Bingler criterion, to constitute
a ``tour service'', the carrier must furnish something substantial in addition to, or different from, bare expeditious
transportation between two points. This contemplates a common interest of passengers visiting a particular place(s)
or event(s) and does not include ordinary, point-to-point transportation, over either regular or irregular routes.

3

 It appears that the ``tour service'' that NAFTA is intended to cover is this type of special operations.





Accordingly, certificates that we issue to Mexican carriers will usually be framed, in accord with our usual practices
with regard to such authorities, to authorize service




Over irregular routes, in foreign commerce, transporting passengers, in charter operations and in special operations,
in tour service, between ports of entry on the international boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, on the one hand,
and, on the other, points in the United States (except Alaska and Hawaii). 




Because this notice is occasioned by a partial lifting of the moratorium, no special rules or rulemaking are necessary.
The same application procedure and regulations apply to Mexican and United States carriers alike. For example, carriers
must abide by all U.S. Department of Transportation safety regulations, comply with the Commission's insurance
requirements (49 U.S.C. 10927), publish and file with the Commission applicable tariffs (49 U.S.C. 10761, 10762),
and file with the Commission agents for service of process (49 U.S.C. 10330). We will, however, provide a short comment
period to enable interested persons to submit written views, arguments or representations regarding this subject.
Because we have little or no discretion in this area, we do not contemplate a subsequent decision unless we receive
comments raising substantial issues it would be helpful or necessary to address. Notice of this proceeding will be
published in the 

Federal Register

 and the 

ICC Register

 and interested parties will have 7 days from the date of publication to comment.

Finally, the current application form OP-1 requires all applicants for ICC operating authority to certify
that they are not domiciled in Mexico or owned or controlled by persons of Mexico. We will modify that certification
requirement when we revise the application form. For the present, Mexican charter and special operations applicants
should either disregard the certification section, or simply indicate ``not applicable.'' Applicants not completing
the certification affirmatively will receive charter and special operations tour service authority limited to
movements in foreign commerce.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of policy decision.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Copyright Office publishes this notice to inform the public that the North American Free Trade Agreement which
entered into force on January 1, 1994, and its implementing legislation (Pub. L. No. 103-182) authorizes the Copyright
Office to establish procedures for copyright restoration of certain works first fixed or published in Mexico or Canada
after January 1, 1978 and before March 1, 1989. This notice is intended to summarize the content of that legislation.
Copyright owners of affected works must file a statement of intent with the Copyright Office to restore copyright
for eligible works; details of new procedures to file these statements will be published within the next 60 days. 










</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The North American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. No.
103-182) provide for the restoration of copyright for certain works that are currently in the public domain in the
United States. Under new section 104A of title 17, copyright protection may be restored for certain motion pictures
that were first fixed or published in Mexico or Canada, and any work included in such motion pictures that was first
fixed or published with these motion pictures, if the work ``entered the public domain in the United States because
it was first published on or after January 1, 1978, and before March 1, 1989, without the notice required by sections
401, 402, or 403 of [title 17], the absence of which has not been excused by the operation of section 405 of [title 17],
as such sections were in effect during that period.'' 17 U.S.C. 104A(a) (1993). A motion picture or underlying work
(such as original music or dramatic text embodied in the motion picture) meeting these requirements ``shall have
copyright protection under [title 17] for the remainder of the term of copyright protection to which it would have
been entitled in the United States had it been published with such notice.'' 

Id

.


Copyright owners of qualifying works must file a ``statement of intent'' with the Copyright Office between January
1, 1994 (the date on which the Agreement entered into force) and January 1, 1995 to notify the public of their intent
to restore copyright protection for these works in the United States. After January 1, 1995, the Copyright Office
must publish in the Federal Register, the list of works for which statements have been filed and which are determined
to be properly qualified for protection. The restoration of copyright protection for these works will be provided
at that time in accordance with section 104A of title 17. Section 104A(c) of title 17 provides that persons who are copying,
performing or selling copies of such works may continue such activities for a period of one year following publication
of the 1995 Federal Register notice. This exemption applies only to copies produced or acquired before the date of
enactment of the implementing legislation (December 8, 1993).
Within the next 60 days, the Copyright Office will announce in the Federal Register the procedures necessary to file
a ``statement of intent'' with the Office, including the applicable statements and materials that must be submitted.
In the meantime, copyright owners and other interested parties can contact Eric Schwartz, Policy Planning Advisor,
Copyright Office, at (202) 707-8350, for additional information.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to a Discount of its Transaction, Comparison and Floor Brokerage Transaction and Assessment
Fees for November 29, 1993 to December 31, 1993</DOCTITLE>



January 4, 1994.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 20, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The Phlx proposes to discount its transaction, comparison and floor brokerage transaction and assessment fees encompassing
all transactions executed on the Phlx in equities, equity options, index options and foreign currency options on
the Phlx for the billing cycle beginning settlement date November 29, 1993, to settlement date December 31, 1993.
The discount shall be a 33 percent reduction across-the-board for all fees, charges and assessments as described
above.






II. Self-regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose




The Exchange seeks to discount its transaction, comparison and floor brokerage transaction and assessment fees
encompassing all transactions executed on the Phlx in equities, equity options, index options and foreign currency
options on the Phlx for the billing cycle beginning settlement date November 29, 1993, to settlement date December
31, 1993. The discount shall be a 33 percent reduction across-the-board for all fees, charges and assessments as described
above for the limited period from November 29, 1993, to December 31, 1993 (Phlx's final month's billing cycle) in recognition
of record volume and cost efficiencies anticipated to continue through December. In this regard, discounts will
not apply to non-transaction related fees and charges such as the floor facilities fees, booth and post rental fees,
as well as membership dues, etc.



2. Statutory Basis




The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among members using its facilities. The proposed fee schedule change also aligns
service fees more closely to the cost of providing those services.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others




Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action




The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore has
become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At any
time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-93-62 and should be submitted by January
28, 1994.

Escort Vessels for Certain Oil Tankers



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A two-part study assessing the capability of escort tugs to control disabled tankers in Prince William Sound, Alaska,
was commissioned by the Disabled Tanker Towing Study Group (DTTSG). The study will specifically review the present
equipment, personnel, and procedures aboard the tankers and escort vessels operating in Prince William Sound, as
well as the assist capabilities of the vessels presently in service for escorting these tankers. Part 1 of the study
has been completed, and the U.S. Coast Guard has been granted permission to make it available to the public. Certain
technical findings of this study will aid the U.S. Coast Guard in promulgating national-level tug escort regulations
under section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background and Discussion



In the aftermath of the EXXON VALDEZ grounding, the state of Alaska established a contingency plan that includes provisions
requiring laden tankers to be escorted through Prince William Sound. The escort vessels are expected to provide immediate
assistance to a tanker in the event it suffers a propulsion or steering failure. The escort vessels also have some spill
response capabilities. At present, there are 11 tugs and escort vessels in this service, operating out of Port Valdez
and escorting tankers to Hinchinbrook Entrance.

The Disabled Tanker Towing Study Group (DTTSG) was formed to review the present escort vessel practices in Prince
William Sound. The DTTSG is formed of representatives from the Regional Citizen's Advisory Council (RCAC) for Prince
William Sound, the Prince William Sound Tanker Association, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the Alaska Department
of Environmental Conservation, and the U.S. Coast Guard.

The DTTSG commissioned The Glosten Associates, Inc., to prepare a two-part study. The first part was to conduct an
expert review and evaluation of the emergency towing equipment aboard the tankers and escort vessels operating in
Prince William Sound. The second part was to determine, by means of actual tanker/tug trials and computer simulation
analyses, the capabilities of the escort vessels to actually control disabled tankers.



The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90)



Section 4116(c) of OPA 90 requires the Secretary of Transportation to initiate issuance of regulations that define
areas where single hull tankers over 5,000 gross tons transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two towing
vessels (as defined under 46 U.S.C. 2101), or by other vessels which the Secretary considers appropriate. These defined
areas must include Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Rosario Strait and Puget Sound, Washington (including those
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca east of Port Angeles, Haro Strait, and the Strait of Georgia subject to U.S. jurisdiction).
The Secretary has delegated this responsibility to the Coast Guard.



Federal Regulatory Action to Date



The Coast Guard's regulatory response to this section of OPA 90 has been divided into two rulemaking projects: the
first project (CGD 91-202) focuses on the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters specifically identified
in the statute, the second project (CGD 91-202a) focuses on other navigable waters where escorts might be required.

In order to issue effective national escort rules, the Coast Guard finds it necessary to determine the realistic capabilities
of the various types of tugs that may be used for escort service. To this end, the Disabled Tanker Towing Study (DTTS)
is expected to provide valuable technical information. In addition to its participation in the DTTSG, Coast Guard's
other actions to date have been as follows:

(1) A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters was published in the


Federal Register

 on July 7, 1992 (57 FR 30058). Because the original public comments did not include sufficient information on certain
issues, the comment period was reopened March 26, 1993 (58 FR 16391), with a request for more-detailed comments on
some specified issues. Altogether, more than 100 public comments were received.

(2) An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking public comment on other navigable waters where escort
vessels should be required was published April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25766). This ANPRM also requested detailed comments
on some specified issues. More than 45 public comments were received.

(3) Three public hearings were held: in Anchorage, Alaska, on June 3, 1993; Valdez, Alaska, on June 5, 1993; and Seattle,
Washington, on June 7, 1993. Both Alaska hearings had teleconferencing arrangements to include outlying communities
in the Exxon Valdez impacted areas. All three hearings were well attended. Locally-interested parties, including
individuals and representatives of environmental, commercial fishing, and recreational groups, tug operators,
pilots, and tanker operators, made presentations at each hearing. Transcripts of the three hearings have been put
in files 43, 44, and 45 of Coast Guard docket 91-202a.



Summary of the Study



The Executive Summary from Part 1 of the DTTS, ``Evaluation of Existing Equipment, Personnel and Procedures,'' is
reprinted here verbatim:

``This study has been undertaken by The Glosten Associates, Inc., to evaluate the existing capability for emergency
towing at Prince William Sound and to examine alternatives that could enhance the escort and assist capabilities
for disabled tankers within the waterway from the Alyeska Oil Terminal at the Port of Valdez to the Gulf of Alaska outside
Hinchinbrook Entrance.

Part 1, reported herein, is an objective evaluation by an experienced salvage towing master of the existing tugs,
emergency towing equipment, towing practices, and discussion of alternate tug types. Part 2 will evaluate alternative
equipment and deployments, using engineering methods, including simulation, that could improve the safety or cost-effectiveness
of the response system.

<PARENT> FR940110-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Part 1 investigation was performed by subcontractor Smit Tak BV, based in Rotterdam. Captain Jan ter Haar, a senior
Smit Tak salvage master, conducted interviews and observed normal operations and emergency drills in the Valdez
area.


Captain ter Haar feels that, with some changes such as improved bow fendering, the existing escort/response vessels
(ERVs) are adequate to control a ship's heading in the event of a steering failure and to tow it in the event of loss of
propulsive power. He reserves any final opinion on the number of such vessels required to control an incident, in relation
to the size of tanker and the weather conditions, to the results of simulations in Part 2.


All tankers calling at Valdez are required to carry specific emergency towing gear for rapid deployment and connection
to a rescue tug. This ``Prince William Sound Emergency Towing Package'' is stowed and deployed differently on various
vessels. Captain ter Haar recommends that all vessels adopt systems that can be readied for deployment in 15 minutes
or less by a crew of two without using winch power. 


Captain ter Haar demonstrated in drills several effective alternative methods of making towing connections with
the tugs' own gear, without deploying the ship's Prince William Sound Towing Package. Drills were also used to assess
crew skills in towing large tankers in adverse weather with multiple tugs. He concludes that additional drills and
training, both in the makeup and towing operations, would be beneficial.


With regard to escort vessel operations, Captain ter Haar recommends that, in the Valdez Narrows area, escort position
should be in close proximity to tankers for faster response to a steering failure. However, in the more open waters
of Prince William Sound, where a power or steering failure will not result in immediate peril of grounding, close escort
does not increase the level of safety of the system. Escort vessels strategically positioned at key locations would
appear to provide the same level of protection. This deployment issue will be analyzed more thoroughly in Part 2.


Captain ter Haar concludes that the vessels presently under contract are suitable for rescue towing in Prince William
Sound under a full range of weather conditions. In the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska, at and beyond Hinchinbrook
Entrance, he concludes that a larger salvage tug would improve the capability to prevent a major casualty.''




Anticipated Course of Action



The second phase of the DTTS (tanker/tug maneuvering trials and computer simulation analyses) is currently underway.
The Coast Guard has been informed that the technical data collection should be completed by January, 1994, and that
Part 2 of the study will be released by spring, 1994.


In the meantime, the Coast Guard is now reviewing all public comments and studying various technical submittals,
including Part 1 of the DTTS. Because the Federal regulations that it ultimately proposes as a result of this review
will probably differ from those proposed in the NPRM, the Coast Guard plans to issue a Supplementary Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (SNPRM). The Coast Guard anticipates issuing the SNPRM after Part 2 of the study has been reviewed and analyzed.

Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs: This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372
(Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs) and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. 

The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and to strengthen federalism
by relying on State and local processes for State and local government coordination and review of proposed Federal
financial assistance. 

Applicants must contact the appropriate State Single Point of Contact to learn about, and to comply with, the State's
process under Executive Order 12372. Applicants proposing to perform activities in more than one State should contact
the Single Point of Contact for each of those States and follow the procedure established in each State under the Executive
order. If you want to know the name and address of any State Single Point of Contact, see the list published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 50162-50164). 

In States that have not established a process or chosen a program for review, State, areawide, regional, and local
entities may submit comments directly to the Department. 

Any State Process Recommendation and other comments submitted by a State Single Point of Contact and any comments
from State, areawide, regional, and local entities must be mailed or hand-delivered by the date indicated in this
notice to the following address: The Secretary, E.O. 12372-CFDA 84.198, U.S. Department of Education, room

Instructions for Part II_Partnership Agreement Form 



Partners must submit a signed Partnership Agreement Form and enclose it with the application. As indicated in 34 CFR
472.2, it is essential that the partners sign and submit this document in order for their application to be considered
complete. If the agreement is retyped, the applicant should make sure that none of the wording is changed. Any changes
in wording could alter the meaning of the agreement and thus render the application ineligible. Any reference in the
application to an organization as a partner in the project is considered to mean a bona fide partner in the partnership
who must sign the partnership agreement. If the document is not signed by all organizations identified as partners
and submitted with the application or if the wording is changed and alters the meaning of the agreement, the Secretary
will return the application without further consideration for funding pursuant to 34 CFR 75.216. 

Preference is given under this program to an application that includes one or more small businesses as a partner. For
the purpose of this program, to claim a small business preference, the applicant must certify which of the partner
enterprises is a small business under the Small Business Administration's Size Standards: Final and Interim Final
Rules (13 CFR part 121) and furnish the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code in the Final and Interim Final
Rules within which each such enterprise classifies itself. The SIC code for a small business partner must be entered
in the space provided on the Partnership Agreement Form.

34 CFR 75.564-75.568 provides the formula for determining the restricted indirect cost rate and provides definitions
of terms used in the formula. A grantee other than a State or local government may use the restricted indirect cost rate
or eight percent, whichever is less. Copies of part 75 of 34 CFR may be obtained from the Government Printing Office
by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. Telephone:
(202) 783-3238. These regulations may also be found at many local libraries. 


Section B_Cost Sharing Summary 


Indicate the actual rate and amount of cost sharing. The National Workplace Literacy Program requires that the partnership
provide at least 30 percent cost sharing. The share required refers to a percentage of Total project cost, not of Federal
funds. 


Part IV_Instructions for Budget Narrative 


Prepare a detailed Budget Narrative for the first year of the project that justifies, and/or clarifies the budget
figures shown in sections A and B. (Please note that the National Literacy Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-73) amended
the section of the Adult Education Act that authorizes the National Workplace Literacy Program to permit any eligible
organization to use 100 percent Federal funds for administrative costs incurred in establishing a project during
a start-up period. 34 CFR 472.32(b) requires that an applicant minimize the start-up period, if any, proposed for
its project and that the start-up period not exceed six months.) Explain: 
1. The basis used to estimate certain costs (professional personnel, consultants, travel, indirect costs) and any
other cost that may appear unusual; 
2. How the major cost items relate to the proposed project activities; 
3. The costs of the project's evaluation component; 
4. What matching occurs in each budget category; and 
5. A breakdown of expenditures in the start-up period, and in the subsequent operational period. 

Provide estimated budget totals for the second and third years of the project.

Before preparing the Application Narrative, an applicant should read carefully the description of the program and
the selection criteria the Secretary uses to evaluate applications. 

The narrative should encompass each function or activity for which funds are being requested and should_
1. Begin with an Abstract; that is, a summary of the proposed project including a list of the members of the partnership;

2. Describe the proposed project in light of each of the selection criteria in the order in which the criteria are listed
in this application package; and 
3. Include any other pertinent information that might assist the Secretary in reviewing the application. 
The Secretary strongly requests the applicant to limit the Application Narrative to no more than 50 double-spaced,
typed, 81/2
'
' x 11
'
' pages (on one side only), although the Secretary will consider applications of greater length. Be sure that

'
' x 11
'
' paper (e.g., letters of support, footnotes, resumes, etc.), or any other pertinent information that might
assist the Secretary in reviewing the application.

Appendix B 


Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 

Federal Register

 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted, regardless of the circumstances.

Q. We just missed the deadline for a previous Department of Education competition. May we submit the application we
prepared for it under this competition? 
A. Yes. However the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the competition to which it is submitted. 
Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions.

Q. How can I best ensure that my application is received on time and is considered under the correct competition? 
A. Applicants should carefully follow the instructions for filing applications that are set forth in this notice.
Be sure that Block 10 of the face page of the application (Standard form 424) clearly indicates the CFDA number 84.198,
and the title of the program_National Workplace Literacy Program_representing the competition in which the application
should be considered. 
Q. Will you help us prepare our application? 
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priority. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required,
nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
Q. How long should an application be? 
A. The Department of Education is making a concerted effort to reduce the volume of paperwork in discretionary program
applications. However, the scope and complexity of projects is too variable to establish firm limits on length. Your
application should provide enough information to allow the review panel to evaluate the significance of the project
against the criteria of the competition. We recommend that you address all of the selection criteria in an ``Application
Narrative'' of no more than 50 pages in length. Supporting documentation may be included in appendices to the 
Application Narrative. Some examples: 
(1) Staff qualifications. These should be brief. They should include the person's title and role in the proposed project
and contain only information about his or her qualifications that are relevant to the proposed project. Qualifications
of consultants should be provided and be similarly brief. Resumes may be included in the appendices. 
(2) Copies of evaluation instruments proposed to be used in the project in instances where such instruments are not
in general use. 
(3) Copies (samples) of any curricula that reflect the applicant's experience and the scope and direction of any current
or previous projects related to this application. 
Note that a Budget Narrative describing specific uses of funds requested in the budget form also is required. No applications
will be funded without this material. The Budget Narrative is not included in the recommended 50 page limit. 
Q. How should my application be organized? 
A. The applicant should assemble its package in the following order: The SF 424 on top, followed by the abstract, Partnership
Agreement Form, table of contents, Budget Information Form, Budget Narrative, Application Narrative, assurances
and certifications, and appendices.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940110-2-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940110-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Do not substitute your own cover for the SF 424. Please include one extra, loose copy of the SF 424 for use by the Application
Control Center. Please number all pages. The Application Narrative should be organized to follow the exact sequence
of the components in the selection criteria in this notice. 
Q. Can project funds be used to cover travel expenses? 
A. Travel associated with carrying out the project can be funded using program funds if necessary and reasonable.
The Secretary anticipates that the project director, one business or labor representative, and the evaluator will
attend three developmental staff meetings over the course of the project (one start-up conference, one mid-point
conference, and one close-out conference). Therefore, you may wish to include the costs of nine trips to Washington,
D.C. in the travel budget. 
Q. How can I ensure that my application is filed on behalf of a validly formed partnership? 
A. The requirements for forming a partnership and filing an application on its behalf are explained in  472.2
of the program regulations. A partnership requires a signed agreement between at least one entity described in  472.2(a)(1)
and at least one entity described in  472.2(a)(2). Note that State and local governments_like any other entities_may
not qualify as partners unless they fall within these descriptions. For example, under the regulations, a State or
local educational agency or a municipal employment and training agency is an eligible partner, but a State or city
government is not an eligible partner. No agency of the Federal government is an eligible partner. Federal employees
including members of the armed services are not eligible for training. If you are not sure whether a particular entity
is an eligible partner, please call the program officers listed as information contacts in the application notice.

Q. Can entities that are not eligible partners be involved in a workplace literacy project? 
A. Yes. They could potentially be involved as ``contractors,'' ``helping organizations,'' or ``sites,'' as defined
in  472.5 of the regulations. Note that entities that are ``helpers'' or ``sites'' may not receive funds from
the grant. 
Q. Must the signed partnership agreement be submitted with the application? 
A. Yes. The agreement is required both to establish the partnership's legal eligibility and to ensure each partner's
continuing commitment during the workplace literacy project. Prior to submitting an application, partners should
ensure that each partner clearly understands its role and responsibilities in the project. 
The Department interprets even a single reference in the application to an organization as a partner to mean that it
is a bona fide partner in the partnership and, thus, is required to sign the partnership agreement. The applicant should
be careful to designate partners, helpers, contractors, etc. in the same way wherever they are mentioned throughout
the application. Because partnership requirements are established by law, the Department reviews each agreement
form to be certain that it meets the terms of the law requiring all entities named as partners to sign the agreement.
The Department wishes to underscore that if any of the entities named as partners in the application have not signed
the agreement form, the application will be returned to the applicant without further consideration for funding.

Q. How does the Department define ``small business''? 
A. In 34 CFR 472.5, the Department defines ``small business'' as a business entity that_
(1) Is organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States and that makes a significant contribution
to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor, or both; and 
(2) May be in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association,
trust or a cooperative, except that where the form is a joint venture there can be no more than 49 percent participation
by foreign business entities in the joint venture; and

(3) Meets the requirements found in 13 CFR part 121 concerning Standard Industrial Classification codes and size
standards. 



If you are not sure whether or not you meet the definition of a small business, you may want to contact your local district
office or regional office of the Small Business Administration (SBA) for advice. If you are unable to locate those
offices you may call the SBA's Office of Size Standards at (202) 205-6618. 



Q. May an application including a business partner that is a small local affiliate of a larger corporation receive
the small business priority points? 



A. The overall size of the business partner and its affiliates will determine the answer. Size determinations must
include the business partner and all its domestic and foreign affiliates regardless of whether the affiliates are
organized for profit. 13 CFR 121.401 describes affiliating circumstances for size determination purposes and establishes
exceptions thereto. 



Q. May an application including a business partner that operates as the small local franchisee or licensee of a larger
corporation receive the small business priority points? 



A. Small business priority points may be awarded when a business partner meets the following three conditions: It
(1) is a local franchisee or licensee within the size determination standards, (2) has the right to profit from its
efforts and (3) bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. Exceptions to this general interpretation may
arise where affiliation results from other means than the franchise or license agreement such as common ownership,
common management or excessive restrictions on the sale of the franchise interest. See  121.401(m) of 13 CFR.




Q. Must a small business participant be a partner for 
the application to qualify for the small business priority points? 



A. Yes. The small business participant must be a partner who has signed the Partnership Agreement for the application
to qualify for the extra points. 



Q. Must an applicant provide the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for the small busines
