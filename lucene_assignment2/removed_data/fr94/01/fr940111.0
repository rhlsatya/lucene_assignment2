Definition of ``Indian Tribal Household'' 



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule broadens the current regulatory 
definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the Food Distribution 
Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) and the 
Food Distribution Program for Indian Households in Oklahoma 
(FDPIHO). First, this change mandates that all 
households which pass the program means test, reside in 
designated areas near a reservation where an Indian Tribal 
Organization (ITO) or State agency provides program services, and 
include a Native American be eligible to participate in the 
FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's tribal affiliation or 
age. Secondly, it also makes such households which lack a Native 
American adult, but which include Native American children, 
eligible to participate in the FDPIHO. Finally, this rule 
clarifies that all households which pass the program means test 
and live on a reservation where an ITO or State agency 
administers the FDPIR, are eligible to receive benefits 
regardless of whether they contain a Native American.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Classification 


Executive Order 12866 


This interim rule is issued in conformance with E.O. 12866. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-12). Ellen Haas, 
Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has certified 
that this interim rule will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since this 
rule will not result in significant changes in participation for 
the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and the Food 
Distribution Program for Indian Households in Oklahoma, the 
impact on Indian Tribal Organizations and State agencies which 
participate in these programs will be minimal. 


Executive Order 12372 


The programs addressed in this action are listed in the Catalog 
of Federal Domestic Assistance under 10.550 and 10.570 and are 
subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local 
officials (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule-related 
notice published June 24, 1983 (48 FR 29114)). 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This interim rulemaking imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping 
provisions that are subject to Office of Management and Budget 
review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 
U.S.C. 3501-3520).

Executive Order 12778 



This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the 

Effective Date 

section of the preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of the provisions,
all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. This includes any administrative procedures provided
by state or local governments. For disputes involving procurements by State agencies or Indian Tribal Organizations,
this includes any administrative appeal procedures to the extent required by 7 CFR 253.5(l), 7 CFR 254.3(a), and 7
CFR part 3016. 

The rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), proposed to authorize ITOs and State agencies to serve income-eligible
households residing in near areas which contain an Indian tribal member, regardless of that person's tribal affiliation.
This interim rule will mandate that all such households be provided program benefits upon application. Because the
Department believes that permitting ITOs and State agencies to exclude these Native Americans from program participation
simply because they do not live on a reservation or near their tribe's reservation is inequitable and counter to the
intent of FDPIR, the Administrator of FNS has determined that prior notice and comment on this provision of this rule
would be unnecessary and contrary to public interest. For this reason, the Administrator has determined, in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), that good cause exists to waive the solicitation of public comments prior to implementation.
However, the Department believes this rule may be improved by public comment based on actual operating experience.
Therefore, comments solicited on this rule must be postmarked or submitted on or before March 14, 1994. All comments
will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes to the rule will be incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final
rule. 



Background 




The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) was established by section 4(b) of the Food Stamp Act
of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2013(b)), as an alternative to food stamps for low-income Native Americans who, because
they live on or near Indian reservations in sparsely populated areas, may not have convenient access to food stamp
certification offices or authorized food stamp retailers. However, the current regulatory definition of ``Indian
tribal household'' at 7 CFR 253.2(c) and 254.2(d) renders ineligible certain categories of such Native Americans.



The first category is comprised of households which lack a Native American adult, but which include Native American
children. Although such households do not exist in large numbers, they reside in many of the areas adjacent to reservations
(i.e., ``near areas'') which Indian Tribal Organizations or State agencies have chosen to serve. Native American
children may be part of a household that lacks a Native American adult due, for example, to death of a parent or divorce.
Also, Native American children may be living with non-Native American foster or adoptive parents. These children
are not necessarily in any less need of the program than children living with Native American adults in near areas,
who may participate. The definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) requires that all
households residing in a near area have an adult Indian tribal member in order to participate. The definition in the
FDPIHO at 7 CFR 254.2(d) also requires that all households have an adult Indian member in order to participate. Thus,
Native American children in otherwise eligible households are denied access to both of these programs. 


The second category excluded from participating applies only to FDPIR: Native American households, residing in
near areas, which lack a member of a tribe that is represented by the ITO or State agency administering the program on
the adjacent reservation. The definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 253.2(c) excludes such households,
in effect, due to the combination of their tribal affiliation and where they reside. They could be eligible if they
lived on the reservation in question, or on or near the reservation of the tribe of which they are a member. The Department
believes that exclusion of these Native Americans from program participation simply because they do not live on a
reservation or near their tribe's reservation, is inequitable and counter to the intent of FDPIR. Their Native American
identity and potential need for the program are in no way diminished by their current residence. In contrast, Native
American tribal households residing in any program service area in Oklahoma may participate in FDPIHO regardless
of their tribal affiliation.

In  253.2(e) of the proposed rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), the Department proposed to amend
the FDPIR definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to give ITOs and State agencies the option to serve a household
which lacks a member of a tribe they represent, but which includes a member of another recognized Indian tribe. All
16 comments received on this proposed change supported it. During its 1992 annual meeting, the National Association
of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations (NAFDPIR) also supported the proposal. In resolution 92-7,
NAFDPIR supported the broadening of the current definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to include ``any household
in which at least one household member is recognized as an Indian.'' NAFDPIR believes that all Native Americans in
near areas should be eligible to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation as has always been the case in
FDPIHO service areas. The language in the proposed rule addressing this issue is therefore implemented in this interim
rule with two clarifications. 
First, the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in  253.2(c) is revised by changing ``recognized by the
appropriate ITO as a tribal member'' to ``recognized as a tribal member by any Indian tribe as defined in this part.''
This change in definition would make those households containing a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in Section
253.2(d) eligible to apply for FDPIR without regard to whether the person is a member of a tribe represented by the ITO
or State agency administering the program in the near area. Thus, based on the definition of ``Indian tribe,'' any
household containing a person belonging to any Indian tribe, band, or other organized Indian group on a reservation
which is recognized as eligible for Federal programs and services provided to Indians, or which holds a treaty with
a State government, would be eligible to receive FDPIR benefits if he/she also meets the income eligibility requirements.
This same amendment is made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in  254.2(d) of the FDPIHO regulations.
However, in the FDPIHO, income-eligible Native American households residing in any program service area in the State
have always been permitted to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation. Therefore, this amendment as
applied to FDPIHO constitutes a clarification only and not, as in the case of the FDPIR, a substantive change which
affects program eligibility. 
Second,  253.6(b)(1) is changed to clarify that all households which pass the program means test, reside in
near areas and include a Native American must be allowed to participate in the FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's
specific tribal affiliation. Thus, if a household member can obtain documentation from his/her tribe of origin that
he/she is recognized as a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in  253.2(d), the ITO or State agency administering
the program in the near area must accept that recognition for purposes of program eligibility. The ITO or State agency
itself has no discretion to decide which tribes it will recognize in the near area. It should be pointed out that the
ITO or State agency also has no discretion to decide issues of tribal membership since each Indian tribe has always
been responsible for defining its own members. Thus, for eligibility purposes, the ITO or State agency simply makes
a determination as to whether or not an applicant household has official documentation of membership from its tribe
of origin. If the tribe of origin is an ``Indian tribe,'' as defined in  253.2(d), the ITO or State agency must
serve the household as long as it meets all other FDPIR eligibility requirements. 
The October 20, 1987, proposed rule did not clearly propose to mandate that all households with Indian tribal members
be eligible for program benefits in near areas. Rather, its thrust was to remove a regulatory barrier to participation
of such households. Thus the language authorized ITOs and State agencies to serve such households. Upon further consideration
of the issue, the Department has concluded that ITOs or State agencies themselves should not be in a position to impose
barriers to participation based on the tribal affiliation of a member of a household residing in a near area. Therefore,
this interim rule mandates that such households be served under the program if they are determined income-eligible,
rather than permitting the administering agency to serve them at its discretion. Given the shift from allowing such
households to be served in the proposed rule to mandating that they be served, the Department is publishing this rule
as an interim regulation with provision for public comment.

Current FDPIR regulations do not clearly state that non-Native 
American households living on the reservation who meet the 
program means test are eligible to receive program benefits, 
although this has always been the policy under which FDPIR has 
operated on all participating reservations. While the 1987 
proposed rule did not specifically address this issue, this 
interim rule does so in order to formalize and clarify what has 
always been household eligibility policy and practice. 
Therefore,  253.6(b)(1) is revised to clarify that all 
households living on the reservation, and meeting the program 
means test, are eligible to receive program benefits, even if 
they do not contain a Native American. 
The 1987 proposed rule did not specifically propose to remove the 
FDPIR requirement that households living in a near area must 
include an adult Native American in order to be eligible for 
participation in FDPIR. However, in the preamble, the Department 
indicated that this suggestion had been made, summarized the 
reason for such a change, and solicited comments to determine how 
extensive this problem is and whether others believe that a 
change in the definition is necessary. Nineteen of the 20 
comments received in response to this solicitation supported 
removal of the requirement. Accordingly, the definition of 
``Indian tribal household'' in FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) in the 
interim rule reads as follows: ``a household in which at least 
one household member is recognized as a tribal member by any 
Indian tribe, as defined in this part.'' This same amendment is 
also made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 
254.2(d). Since the requirement that the household include an 
adult Native American in order to be eligible also exists in 
FDPIHO, the change will have the same remedial effect in this 
program.

Oranges and Grapefruit Grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; Temporary Relaxation of Minimum Size Requirements
for Texas Grapefruit 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule finalizes without change an interim final rule that temporarily relaxed the minimum size requirements
for certain Texas grapefruit for the entire 1993-94 season. The Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee)
met July 15, 1993, and unanimously recommended this action. This rule is expected to help the Texas citrus industry
successfully market the 1993-94 season grapefruit crop. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 906, as amended (7 CFR part 906), regulating
the handling of oranges and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the
order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601-674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are about 15 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges and grapefruit
grown in Texas, and about 750 producers of oranges and grapefruit in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been
defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
The committee, which administers the order locally, meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations
effective on a continuous basis for each citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the
public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations,
information submitted by the committee and other information, to determine whether modification, suspension,
or termination of the handling regulation is needed. 
The interim final rule was issued on October 18, 1993, with an effective date of October 25, 1993, and published in the


Federal Register

 (58 FR 54925, October 25, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 24, 1993,
and no comments were received. 
The interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4) of  906.365 by temporarily relaxing the minimum size requirement
to permit shipment of grapefruit measuring at least 35/16 inches in diameter (pack size 112) for the entire 1993-94
season ending July 31, 1994, provided such grapefruit grade at least U.S. No. 1. 
This relaxation is expected to help the Texas citrus industry successfully market its 1993-94 season grapefruit
crop and have a positive effect on producer returns. Permitting shipment of pack size 112 grapefruit grading at least
U.S. No. 1 for the entire 1993-94 season will enable Texas grapefruit handlers to meet market needs and compete
with similar sized grapefruit expected to be shipped from Florida. This action is based on the current and prospective
crop and market conditions for Texas grapefruit. Fresh Texas grapefruit shipments began in mid-September this season.

The interim final rule also removed paragraph (c) of  906.365. That paragraph set forth quality requirements
for oranges and grapefruit which were in effect through February 15, 1992. Thus, the provisions in that paragraph
were obsolete. 

Texas grapefruit shipments to fresh markets in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are subject to handling requirements
effective under this order. Exempt from such handling requirements are shipments made: (1) Within the production
area in Texas; (2) in individually addressed gift packages aggregating not more than 500 pounds which are not for resale;
(3) under the 400 pound minimum quantity exemption provision; and (4) for relief, charity, and home use. In addition,
fruit shipped to approved processors located outside of the production area may be exempted from the handling requirements.





This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the relaxed requirements
set forth in the interim final rule. The Department believes that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers
and handlers because it will permit 1993-94 season grapefruit shipments consistent with anticipated crop
and market conditions. The application of handling requirements to Texas grapefruit over the years has been beneficial
to the Texas citrus industry in marketing its crops. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the relaxation set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act.

Oranges and Grapefruit Grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; Revision of the Handling Requirements for Oranges
and Grapefruit 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule finalizes without change an interim final rule which revised the handling requirements for Texas oranges
and grapefruit to require handlers to ensure that an inspection certificate accompanies each shipment of fruit when
it is transported by motor vehicle, and that such inspection certificates are surrendered upon leaving the production
area when requested by Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) road guard station personnel designated as agents of
the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee). This revision was designed to help the Texas citrus industry ensure
that all fresh oranges and grapefruit are inspected prior to shipment from the production area. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 (7 CFR Part 906) regulating the handling of oranges
and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the order. The agreement and
order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),
hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12788, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 750 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the
Small Business Administration [13 CFR  121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and
small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 

The committee met on August 3, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (a)(5) of  906.365 to require
handlers to ensure that an inspection certificate accompanies each shipment of fruit when it is transported by motor
vehicle, and that such inspection certificates are surrendered upon leaving the production area when requested
by Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) road guard station personnel designated as agents of the committee. The
committee meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations effective on a continuous basis
for fruit regulated under the marketing order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons
may express their views at these meetings. 

The committee recommended this action after discussions with TDA road guard station personnel on the subject of operating
road guard stations located on the major roads leading out of the production area for Texas oranges and grapefruit.
TDA informed the committee that, heretofore, TDA road guard station personnel had not been authorized to require
handlers to surrender a copy of their inspection certificates to them, when checking fruit being transported from
the production area to determine if it had been inspected and certified as meeting order requirements. Requiring
handlers to surrender a copy of their inspection certificates to the TDA will enable TDA personnel to determine whether
the fruit meets order requirements, thereby helping ensure compliance with order provisions. 
The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, to
determine whether modification, suspension, or termination of the handling regulation is needed. 

The interim final rule was issued on October 4, 1993, with an effective date of October 8, 1993, and published in the


Federal Register

 (58 FR 52400, October 8, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-comment period ending November 8, 1993, and no
comments were received. 

The interim final rule amended  906.365 by adding the following sentence at the end of paragraph (a)(5). ``No
handler may transport by motor vehicle or cause the transportation of any shipment of fruit for which an inspection
certificate is required unless each such shipment is accompanied by a copy of the inspection certificate applicable
thereto, and a copy of such inspection certificate is surrendered upon request to Texas Department of Agriculture
Road Guard personnel as designated by the committee.''

This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revision of handling
requirements set forth in the interim final rule. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial
impact on producers and handlers, since it will authorize TDA road guard station personnel to require surrender of
inspection certificates upon leaving the production area. 

Based on the above the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

South Texas Onions; Increased Expenses and Establishment of Assessment Rate 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amended interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule amends a previous interim final rule which authorized administrative expenses for the South
Texas Onion Committee (Committee) under M.O. No. 959. This interim final rule increases the level of authorized expenses
and establishes an increased assessment rate to generate funds to pay those expenses. Authorization of this increased
budget enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds
to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Order No. 959, both as amended (7 CFR part 959), regulating
the handling of onions grown in South Texas. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, South Texas onions are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable onions handled during the 1993-94 fiscal period,
which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 47 producers of South Texas onions under this marketing order, and approximately 34 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $3,500,000. The majority of South Texas onion producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.


The budget of expenses for the 1993-94 fiscal period was prepared by the South Texas Onion Committee, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for
approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of South Texas onions. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of South Texas onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 

Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 for personnel, office, and compliance expenses were recommended
in a mail vote completed August 4, 1993. The assessment rate and funding for the research and promotion projects were
to be recommended at a later Committee meeting. The Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 were published
in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50509). That interim final rule added  959.234, authorizing
expenses for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments through October 28, 1993. No
comments were filed. 

The Committee subsequently met on November 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended increases of $2,500 for personnel
expenses and $125,000 for compliance activities in the recently approved 1993-94 budget. The compliance increase
will provide for funds to operate road guard stations surrounding the production area. The Committee also unanimously
recommended $210,000 in market development activities and $105,600 in production research. These expenditures
represent increases over last year's budget of $65,000 for market development and $11,412 for production research.
Under this amended budget, expense items for the 1993-94 fiscal period are as follows: $37,472 for personnel,
$29,028 for office expenses, $141,000 for compliance activities, $210,000 for market development, and $105,600
for production research. 

The initial 1994 budget, published on September 28, 1993, did not establish an assessment rate. Therefore, the Committee
also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per 50-pound container or equivalent of onions, $0.03 more
than last year's assessment rate. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of approximately 5 million 50-pound
containers or equivalents, will yield $500,000 in assessment income, which, along with $23,100 from the reserve,
will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve as of September 30, 1993, were $346,415, which is
within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period began on August 1, 1993, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to that taken for the 1992-93
fiscal period; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received
will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Expenses and Assessment Rates for Specified Marketing Orders (Florida Tomatoes and California Walnuts) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 966 and 984 for
the 1993-94 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Florida Tomato Committee and the Walnut
Marketing Board (Committee and Board) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the programs.
Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 125 and Order No. 966, both as amended (7 CFR part 966), regulating
the handling of tomatoes grown in Florida; and Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984),
regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreements and orders are effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as
the Act. 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Florida tomatoes and California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during the 1993-94
fiscal period, which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities

There are approximately 250 producers of Florida tomatoes under Marketing Order 966, and approximately 50 handlers.
Also, there are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under Marketing Order 984, and approximately
65 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may
be classified as small entities. 

The budgets of expenses for the 1993-94 fiscal period were prepared by the Committee and the Board, the agencies
responsible for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Florida Tomato Committee are producers. The members of the California Walnut Board are producers
and handlers. They are familiar with the Committee's and Board's needs and with the costs for goods and services in
their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed
in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input
into these processes. 


The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee and Board expenses by expected
respective shipments of Florida tomatoes and merchantable California walnuts. Because these rates will be applied
to actual shipments of tomatoes and of certified merchantable walnuts, the assessment rates must be established
at levels that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's and Board's expenses. 

The Florida Tomato Committee met September 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993-94 budget of $2,682,000,
which is $4,000 less than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $6,250 for office rent, $200
for miscellaneous, and $4,000 for research expense, will be offset by decreases of $7,000 for office salaries and
$7,450 for employees' retirement program. Major expense items include $276,000 for office salaries, $200,000 for
research expense, and $2,000,000 for education and promotion expense. 


The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.04 per 25-pound container, the same as last year.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 58,000,000 25-pound containers, will yield $2,320,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $20,000 in interest and other income and $342,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve,
will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve at the beginning of the 1993-94
fiscal period were $1,349,348, which is within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses.



The Walnut Marketing Board met September 10, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993-94 budget of $1,941,647,
$69,551 more than the previous year. Increases include $4,511 for administrative salaries, $171 for general insurance,
$200 for audit, $7,649 for group life, retirement, and medical plan, $835 for office salaries, $7,904 for office rent,
$6,000 for office supplies and miscellaneous, $1,000 for telephone and FAX, $2,000 for equipment maintenance and
warranties, $9,000 for furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $7,450 for production research director, and the
addition of a $43,000 acreage survey category. These increases will be partially offset by decreases of $300 for social
security and hospital insurance taxes, $5,000 for domestic market research and development, and $14,869 for production
research. Major expenses include $101,331 for administrative salaries, $40,771 for office salaries, $875,000
for domestic market research and development, $490,488 for production research, $91,068 for production research
director, and $43,000 for a walnut acreage survey. A reserve for contingencies of $50,000 is also included in the 1993-94
budget. 

The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.009 per kernelweight pound, $0.001 less than the
previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 2,157,386 kernelweight pounds of merchantable
walnuts, will yield $1,941,647 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended
funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available
to the handlers from whom collected within that period. 

Interim final rules were published in the 

Federal Register 

in October 27, 1993, for 7 CFR part 966 (58 FR 57719); and on October 28, 1993, for 7 CFR Part 984 (58 FR 57959). Those rules
added  966.231 and  984.344 which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committee
and Board. Those rules provided that interested persons could file comments through November 26, 1993, for 7 CFR part
966 and through November 29, 1993, for 7 CFR part 984. No comments were received.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely
to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee and Board need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred
on a continuous basis. The 1993-94 fiscal periods for the programs began on August 1, 1993. The marketing orders
require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods apply to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during
the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committee and Board
at public meetings and published in the 

Federal Register

 as interim final rules.

Changes in Processing Procedures for Certain Applications and Petitions for Immigration Benefits 
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. 
 


 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule streamlines evidence rules and the processes by which persons may apply for and receive certain immigration
documents and benefits. The rule is necessary to improve service to the public and to streamline operations. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Immigration and Naturalization Service published a proposed rule on December 2, 1991 at 56 FR 61201 as part of a
comprehensive initiative to simplify and streamline the filing and processing of applications and petitions for
immigration benefits. This initiative has already led to a number of steps which have begun to significantly improve
efficiency and the quality of service provided to the public. 
 
 


A number of comments were received about this proposal. Many were prepared by a working group of interested organizations.
The following sections discuss the comments and explain the revisions adopted. 
 


Representation by Another Person 
 


Several commenters opposed the proposed requirement that an applicant or petitioner sing Form G-28, Notice
of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, to show that he or she authorized the representation. For example,
one commenter argued that an attorney's indication that he or she represents someone should be accepted as ``absolutely
definitive evidence'' since submission by an attorney where not so authorized would be a violation of his or her ethical
and legal obligations, and would subject him or her to disciplinary action and a malpractice suit. 
 
However, a number of other commenters within the industry supported the new requirement. Some pointed out that the
form is not only used by attorneys. Others noted that requiring the signature can help combat the unauthorized practice
of law. Still others felt that the signature would address potential Privacy Act concerns. 
 
For the reasons given by those supporting the new requirement, as well a those enumerated in the proposed rule, this
proposal has been retained. An applicant or petitioner must sign the Form G-28 to definitively indicate to the
Service that he or she has authorized the person to represent him or her in the proceeding. The person submitting the
Form G-28 must be authorized under 8 CFR part 292 to represent the applicant or petitioner. Where a Form G-28
is submitted that is not properly signed, the application or petition will be processed as if a Form G-28 had not
been submitted. 
 


Notification Procedures 
 


Where an applicant or petitioner has an authorized representative, the Service now mails two copies of each written
notice. One goes to the applicant or petitioner, and the other goes to the authorized representative. The proposed
rule suggested sending only one notice in such a case, and sending it to the representative. This would have meant that
the Service would communicate with the applicant or petitioner through his or her authorized representative if he
or she had one. 
 
The commenters pointed to past problems in representatives receiving their copy, and argued that separate notices
should be continued as a safeguard. After review, the Service will therefore continue to send separate notices to
the applicant or petitioner and his or her authorized representative.

<TEXT>
 

Several commenters also asked that the Service begin sending copies of notices to anyone assisting an applicant or
petitioner, and not simply to authorized representatives. However, while the Service cannot limit or control who
can assist others in filling out and filing an application or petition, only a person who meets the criteria in 8 CFR
parts 1 and 292 can act as the applicant or petitioner's authorized representative and submit a Form G-28. A person
who does not meet these criteria cannot represent the applicant or petitioner, and cannot be notified of any action
taken on the application or petition.

Several commenters opposed the proposed modification of when the Service would send a notice by certified mail. After
review, this proposal has been withdrawn.



Filing



A number of commenters requested that additional filing instructions be included on forms to eliminate confusion
about where to file. Last year the Service began to include such specific information on the new generation of application
and petition forms. This process will continue as older versions of forms are replaced or eliminated.

Several commenters asked that application and petition forms be published for public comment since the instructions
have the effect of regulation. All form revisions are carefully reviewed to ensure they are consistent with regulations.
In addition to informally circulating significant changes to forms for comment, the Service intends to begin to publish
form revisions as required and as deemed necessary for effective communications. The Service is committed to revising
forms on a more frequent basis to keep up with ever changing immigration laws and changes in procedures. The Service
wants to assist people in learning about immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and help them understand
what is required to file a complete application. This will facilitate quicker processing and minimize the delays
and additional processing costs associated with requests for more information or evidence.

As suggested by many commenters, language has been added to clarify that a child can file an application or petition
for himself or herself, in addition to allowing a parent or legal guardian to file. Other commenters suggested that
anyone be allowed to file such a petition, pointing to 8 CFR 101.6(b)(1), which permits such a broad group of persons
to file petitions for juveniles dependent on a juvenile court in the United States. However, except for these unique
circumstances, there is no valid reason to allow a person who has no legal authority over a child to assume the right
to act in the child's behalf before the Service. Therefore, this suggestion has not been adopted.

The proposal to allow the filing of photocopies of documents with applications and petitions instead of originals
was universally applauded as a significant step in streamlining filing procedures. However, one commenter asked
whether each copy would need to be certified that it is exact and unaltered.

Evidence submitted in the context of an application or petition is part of that application or petition. See 8 CFR 270.1.
By signing the application or petition form, the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the application or
petition, and all evidence submitted with it, is true and correct. The rule has been clarified to indicate that a separate
certification for each copy is not necessary.

Several commenters asked that the rule be revised so that in cases where an applicant or petitioner submits an original
when he or she could have submitted a copy, the Service would be required to make the copy and return the original.

The Service recognizes that people need to retain original documents for their records. This was one of the primary
reasons why the Service made the decision to accept photocopies. However, the Service processes over 4 million applications
and petitions each year. In cases where a person chooses to submit originals instead of copies, the Service is not in
a position to make the copies for him or her so the originals can be returned.

The proposed rule provided that where the Service determines a need to review the original of a document, the applicant
or petitioner would have 30 days to submit the original document. Several commenters suggested that 30 days does not
allow enough time, since people might not have the document and would have to get one from the issuing authority. They
suggested a 60 or 90-day period instead.

The idea of allowing copies was proposed so applicants and petitioners can file a copy and keep the original, not so
they can file a copy because they don't have an original. By filing a copy as part of their application or petition, they
are attesting that the copy is true and correct. This would be problematic if they do not have an original. However,
to minimize confusion and to standardize the various response periods provided in this rule, the final rule provides
12 weeks, without extension, for submission of an original document. If an applicant or petitioner does not submit
the requested original document within that 12-week period, the application or petition will be denied for failure
to provide the original.

Several commenters asked that the Service begin to accept copies and computer-generated versions of application
and petition forms, and to allow filing by facsimile. The Service will accept photocopies and computer-generated
versions that are 

identical

 to Service forms in all respects, including placement, perforations and fastener holes. We cannot accept facsimiles
because they do not meet these requirements. It is essential that the forms not vary in any way from the original since
the Service is introducing imaging systems and other systems to speed processing that depend on exact form specifications.
The Service is also very interested in electronic filing as a way of speeding processing and reducing costs, and is
researching various technologies that would allow such filing with fee transmittal.

Almost every commenter discussed the initial evidence rules, which proposed that an application or petition filed
without the evidence required by the instructions on the application or petition form would be denied, but without
prejudice to the later filing of a complete application or petition. A number of commenters agreed that the proposal
would reduce the percentage of cases in which the Service has to ask for more evidence during the adjudications process,
and thus review twice, and that this would help speed overall processing times. Several commenters noted that the
additional explanations on the new application and petition forms of what evidence is required will help people to
file complete applications and petitions. Others supported threshold standards for filing. However, a number of
commenters had serious reservations about the initial evidence requirements described in the proposed rule.
Several commenters suggested that the Service should help applicants and petitioners correct cases that lack the
required initial evidence rather than require them to start over and file again. Others suggested the proposed rule
did not sufficiently recognize that some people may unintentionally fail to file the required initial evidence.
A few suggested that while the Service should deny clearly deficient cases, it should not deny ``marginal'' cases,
but should give those people a chance to correct their cases.
One commenter suggested that the Service continue to add evidence explanations to its new forms, but only monitor
the effect and not implement procedures to deny incomplete applications. Another commenter, who opposed the entire
concept of threshold requirements, asserted that allowing the Service to deny an application or petition for lack
of initial evidence would give it ``unbridled'' discretion.
Initial evidence is the evidence necessary to establish a basis for filing and to allow the Service to process the average
case through to completion the first time. As indicated by many commenters, it is in the best interest of applicants
and petitioners, as well as in the interest of the Service, that an application or petition be complete when first filed
so a decision can be entered quickly and correctly, without delays caused by having to go back and ask an applicant or
petitioner for more evidence.
The initial evidence explanations included in revised application and petition forms are designed to help people
know what types of basic evidence they should always submit with their application or petition. The explanations
also clarify statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria by translating them into more concrete terms. The question
here is what the Service should do when someone files without the required threshold evidence.
The most basic issues in processing an application or petition for an immigration benefit are determining eligibility
for the benefit, and treating all applicants and petitioners fairly and equitably. Among other things, this means
using processing systems that ensure that cases are not processed in a way that enables one applicant or petitioner
to derive an unfair advantage over another applying for the same benefit. For example, this means ensuring that priority
dates for immigration and case processing dates are accorded in ways that do not encourage a person to file an incomplete
application as a means of stepping in line in front of someone else who waits to obtain all the necessary evidence before
filing. It also means establishing processing parameters to minimize instances where the Service has to handle repeatedly
an application because basic documents are missing. This increases average processing time, and raises costs which
are transferred to all applicants through filing fees.
However, the Service recognizes that these processes must operate in an environment in which a significant number
of applicants and petitioners are unfamiliar with the English language and government requirements. The Service's
goal is to recognize the needs of the population we serve while setting processing parameters that allow the agency
to process applications quickly, correctly and fairly.
In the past, most applications were submitted in person at a local Service office. This provided an opportunity to
review the application, and not accept it at that time if it lacked necessary evidence. However, this has led to occasions
where discrepancies in local acceptance standards have been alleged. In order to make filing easier as the volume
of applications has grown, and to make processing more consistent, the Service has moved towards a mail-in process.
Since advance review is not possible in such a situation, there must be clear guidelines for handling cases filed without
necessary evidence.
The Service has revised the initial evidence process as a result of the comments received. In general, the Service
will not deny a case for lack of initial evidence. An application or petition will be reviewed after fee receipting.
If required initial evidence is missing and there is no evidence of ineligibility in the record, the applicant or petitioner
will be notified and given 12 weeks from the date of the notice, without extension, to submit the missing initial evidence.
However, if the application is pre-screened by INS prior to its submission, such as in a situation where the person
files the application in person, and the person insists on filing the application even though necessary initial evidence
is missing, the case shall be denied for lack of required initial evidence.
This rule does require that where the Service requests evidence after filing, it must be submitted in one response.
In addition, as requested by a commenter, it clarifies that a case that is missing initial evidence will not result
in the loss of its priority date until a final decision is made.
This revised process encourages applicants and petitioners to obtain the necessary threshold evidence before filing
so that their case can be processed in order and without delay. However, it also allows people who fail to file this threshold
evidence a limited period to submit the missing evidence. A time limit of 12 weeks was set because while the Service
wants to afford people an opportunity to correct a filing deficiency, we must balance that with ensuring that the process
does not encourage people to file before they have a complete application or petition.
If an applicant or petitioner does not submit the missing initial evidence within the time limit, the application
or petition will be automatically denied for lack of initial evidence. While the rule clarifies that an applicant
or petitioner may immediately refile after such a denial, it should be noted that if the subsequent case is filed without
the required initial evidence, it may be denied without a grace period.
While this process will normally be sufficient, there are situations where a person's immediate status in the United
States hinges on the application or petition, or he or she becomes entitled to a benefit because the case is pending.
For example, a person who files for adjustment of status would in certain instances be able to obtain an advance parole
to travel based on the pending application. An applicant for an employment authorization document may be entitled
to interim employment authorization because the Service cannot make a decision within a certain period. Applying
the general process outlined above in such situations would allow a person to obtain interim benefits based on an incomplete
application or petition while the Service waits for him or her to submit the necessary initial evidence, or because
he or she asks that an interview be rescheduled, delaying processing.
The filing of an application or petition without the required initial evidence, or asking that a case be rescheduled,
effectively hampers our ability to make a definitive determination of eligibility. An applicant or petitioner may
not be allowed to either inadvertently or intentionally hamper the Service's ability to render a decision and as a
result gain a potential or actual benefit. Therefore, the Service considers processing time for any application
or petition to refer to time unhampered by the applicant or petitioner's action or lack of required action. This means
there is nothing under the applicant or petitioner's control that hampers our ability to make a final decision.
Under the process outlined earlier, filing an application or petition without required initial evidence hampers
the Service's ability to render a final decision. Similarly, requesting a scheduled interview be rescheduled will
delay full adjudication of a request for benefits, and will require the Service to duplicate several processing and
review steps. The process must balance the need to ensure that persons do not receive undue interim benefits with the
need to ensure that any applicable statutory or regulatory processing timeframes are adhered to once we are no longer
hampered from making a decision.
Accordingly, in such circumstances the processing clock will stop with respect to any time limits for adjudicating
the request for Service action at the time the Service sends a notice for initial evidence, and it will start over at
the time the Service receives the evidence. Similarly, the processing clock will start over when the Service receives
a request to reschedule an interview. The clock stops because the lack of required initial evidence or request for
rescheduling hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. It starts over again because to merely have it
resume would effectively shorten the Service's processing window because we have to duplicate several processing
and review steps because the application or petition was not complete when submitted or because we were asked to reschedule
the interview. Having the clock start over also serves to encourage the filing of complete applications, which, as
indicated above, is in the legitimate interests of all applicants and petitioners as well as in the legitimate interest
of the Service. However, this process also preserves the processing clock concept because it does not suspend the
clock indefinitely until we can resume processing.
Since the Service is hampered from making a final decision, interim benefits will not be granted based on a case held
in suspense for the submission of requested initial evidence, except that the Service will normally allow the applicant
or person the petition is for to remain in the country while an application or petition to extend or obtain status while
it is pending. In addition, employment authorization previously accorded based on the same status and employment
as that requested in the current application or petition may continue uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20)
notwithstanding the case being held in suspense for the submission of necessary initial evidence. The Service of
course reserves the right to pursue other actions to seek the removal of persons notwithstanding a pending application
where required, such as in cases involving fraud or clearly frivolous applications.
This rule also provides for denial where evidence submitted later does not establish eligibility at the time of filing.
The evidence must establish that the applicant or petitioner was eligible for the benefit when the application or
petition was filed. As suggested, the Service will monitor the rate of cases in which initial evidence is not submitted
at the time of filing as a way of determining how we can further clarify form instructions, and to determine if we need
to implement other changes, including those originally proposed in the rule, in order to ensure equity and fairness
to all applicants and petitioners.

Additional Evidence, Documents and Translations



At times, an application or petition will meet threshold evidence requirements, but the evidence submitted, or other
evidence available, rises additional questions. In such instances the Service usually provides the applicant or
petitioner an opportunity to respond or to submit additional evidence about the points in question in support of the
claim. Several commenters asked that the Service extend the 60-day period provided for response, as least where good
cause was demonstrated.

The rule has been revised to provide 12 weeks for such submissions. However, waiting for the applicant or petitioner
to respond hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. Since the applicant has already met the threshold
evidence requirements, the processing clock will merely stop as of the date of the request. It will resume at the point
where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or a request for a decision based on the evidence
submitted.

One commenter asserted that the Service should eliminate the distinction between primary and secondary evidence,
and accept any type of credible document with an application or petition. However, historically there have been serious
problems establishing the reliability of many kinds of documents. Further, it is important in judging a claim to know
whether documents that should normally exist actually do.

For example, a woman who files a petition claiming someone is her adult son. There is no birth certificate or other civil
or religious documents from around the time of the birth to support the claim, but she does have several documents issued
years later that suggest that he is her son. After analysis the Service may accept the claim, but the fact the birth certificate
and other documents dating from the birth do not exist is important to that analysis. We could not adequately review
the case if the record was silent about the types of documents that commonly exist. Without evidentiary guidelines,
the Service also would not know whether she merely forgot to attach them or whether they did not exist. This would mean
the Service would have to go back and ask, delaying processing.

However, as requested by several commenters, the Service has clarified the distinction between primary evidence,
secondary evidence and affidavits. The Service has also clarified the rule to indicate that a certification from
an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's Foreign
Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. The Service has also revised the rule as requested
to allow a person to file evidence showing that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain a required document
or certification of unavailability along with less definitive evidence.

The above changes will also apply to secondary evidence. However, because secondary evidence and affidavits are
inherently less reliable and, consequently, have less probative value than primary evidence, such secondary evidence
and affidavits must overcome the fact that more probative primary evidence is unavailable, affidavits must overcome
the absence of all other more probative forms of evidence that would normally be available. If the Service concludes
that primary or secondary evidence should be available, the applicant or petitioner will be asked to obtain it.

Several commenters requested that the rule be revised to only require a translation of the relevant portion of a foreign
language document instead of a full translation. However, only requiring an extract leaves to the applicant or petitioner
and the translator the judgment of what is germane. The Service has found that in many instances the applicant or petitioner's
determination of what is germane is not consistent with the Service's. A full translation is necessary for us to fully
analyze documents submitted.



Withdrawals, Denials, Appeals and Motions



One commenter opposed the proposed bar to retracting a withdrawal, asserting that an applicant or petitioner may
have a legitimate reason for again changing his or her mind. The rule does not question the legitimacy of a change of
heart or mind, nevertheless, under the rule, a withdrawal is considered definitive. An applicant or petitioner who
withdraws a case and later changes his or her mind again may refile a new application or petition. the Service has clarified
this in the rule, and has also clarified that a petitioner may withdraw an approved petition until such time as the beneficiary
has been admitted or has adjusted status.

The proposed rule would allow a motion to reopen a case denied for lack of initial evidence, but would preclude a subsequent
administrative appeal. One commenter suggested that an appeal should be allowed. However, since the issue is simply
whether a stipulated document was or was not submitted, the avenue of a motion is a sufficient safeguard.


Several commenters asked that the proposed rule allowing 30 days to file a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider
be extended to 60 days to give applicants and petitioners time to retain legal counsel and file a response. However,
the 30-day period provided is equivalent to that for filing an appeal, which itself was extended several years ago,
and thus will not be changed.


One commenter suggested that the proposed rule set the level of proof too high for motions to reopen. The provision
has accordingly been revised to clarify the facts that must be demonstrated in the motion. Another commenter asked
that the Service use this rulemaking to make all decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals available to the public.
The concern will be referred to the Executive Office of Immigration Review for future consideration.




Change of Status, Extension of Stay and Use of Form I-94



The proposed rule provided that where a person demonstrated eligibility for an extension or change of status, the
application could be approved at the discretion of the Service. One commenter asserted that discretion should not
enter into the decision. However, sections 214 and 248 of the Immigration and Nationality Act give the Service discretionary
authority to approve or deny applications for extension or change of status. In addition, a decision on this type of
application, and on most other types of applications and petitions, is rarely a simple matter. An alien is not automatically
entitled to these types of benefits. The decision to grant a change of status or extension of stay involves weighing
various factors, and a judgement by the deciding official of whether to grant the benefit.


In response to a number of comments, this rule allows a worker's dependents to be included in a company's petition where
there is only one worker in the petition. This provision will go into effect at the time the form providing for this process
becomes available. 


A person was previously required to submit his or her original Form I-94, Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Record,
with an application to extend or change nonimmigrant status so the Service could annotate the Form I-94 with
its decision on the application. The rule proposed altering this process in certain cases to permit the filing of a
copy of the Form I-94. The notice of decision would serve as evidence of any decision and alteration to the terms
of the person's status.


Several commenters supported this idea, suggesting it will eliminate problems with aliens not having evidence of
status while their application is pending, and that it will streamline filing. In fact, several asked why it was not
being extended to all such applications. However, several others opposed it, arguing that the change would create
yet another document employers would have to deal with, further confusing them as to who is authorized to work. 

The Service is moving to limit to two the number of INS documents employers are required to examine when a person applies
for employment: (a) Form I-551, Alien Registration Card, issued to permanent residents; and (b) Form I-688B,
Employment Authorization Document, also called an EAD, issued to persons who can accept employment in the open labor
market.


However, after determining that an alien is not otherwise authorized to work, an employer may file a petition to temporarily
employ him or her as a nonimmigrant. If the Service approves the petition, we notify the employer. If the alien is not
first required to be admitted in the status, and the Service's approval authorizes immediate employment, we include
this in the notice. The approval of such a petition does not authorize the alien to work elsewhere, but only for the employer
under the terms and conditions of the approved petition. An EAD is not necessary in such a context since the employer
has already determined the alien cannot work unless we approve its petition.


Previously when sending a notice that we had approved such a petition we also made a handwritten notation on the alien's
Form I-94. The computer system we are installing to improve service will allow us to replace such handwritten
notes with a computer generated notice that can be confirmed by the system. Therefore, the rulemaking proposed simplifying
filing requirements and allowing aliens to keep their existing Form I-94 as evidence of their status while their
new application is pending.


To eliminate any confusion, we are revising our approval notice to the employer to include a replacement Form I-94
that the employer can review and then give to the employee. In the interim the original Form I-94 must be filed
with the petition for annotation. The Service will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 when the revised approval notice is implemented, at which time only a copy of the individual's I-94 will be required.




Reentry permits, refugee travel documents and advance paroles




Several commenters stated that applicants for asylum should be eligible for a refugee travel document. However,
an applicant for asylum is an applicant for a benefit, and does not acquire any status or travel authorization merely
as a result of having submitted the asylum application. It would be inappropriate to grant a travel document until
a decision is made that the person is eligible for asylum. If an asylum applicant chooses to leave the United States,
he or she may apply abroad for refugee status to reenter.


A commenter requested clarification that a refugee travel document may be accepted in lieu of a passport as well as
a visa. The final rule clearly refers to the document as a travel document issued pursuant to article 28 of the United
Nations Convention of July 28, 1951 for the purpose of travel.

The Service received many comments regarding advance parole. Although this subject needs to be addressed, the Service
has decided to defer this action to a separate rulemaking.

A number of commenters addressed the reentry permit provisions of the proposed rule. Most suggested that the proposed
provision precluding issuance to most aliens who have been abroad for more than 4 of the last 5 years since becoming
a permanent resident was too limiting, did not provide for exceptions, and did not recognize the needs of permanent
residents who are employed by multi-national companies on extended assignments abroad. 

As was explained in the proposed rule, the Service's intent was to minimize the current broad review by the Government
of all the circumstances surrounding a person's absence, and instead focus on the simpler issue of how long he or she
has been gone. The language of the rule was written in such a way that a person is able to stay abroad for almost 6 years,
with only short trips back to the United States every 2 years, before he or she would become ineligible for a reentry
permit. This standard would have meant some people would not have received a permit, but, again, this ineligibility
in and of itself would not have jeopardized permanent resident status.
We believe a clear standard is preferable to an abstract one in which the Government must look at the person's intent,
location of domiciles and assets, employment circumstances, and other circumstances of his or her life and make a
discretionary decision of whether to issue a permit.
However, upon further consideration, the Service recognizes that there may be those who will be unable to obtain a
travel document other than the reentry permit. Therefore, the rule will be modified so that rather than precluding
the issuance of the document, any such further issuance will be limited to a validity of one year. This simply means
that a person who remains abroad for more than the specified period will thereafter have to return annually to file
an application for a reentry permit instead of every 2 years.
Also, based on the comments received, the Service has revised the list of exceptions to the time limit rule to include
permanent residents defined in 8 CFR 211.1(b)(1)(i)(B), 211.1(b)(1)(ii) or 211.1(b)(4), as well as persons employed
by a public or national organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute, and their dependents.
The rule also exempts professional athletes who compete in the United States and worldwide.


Other issues


Several commenters suggested that the Service issue to any applicant for a replacement alien registration card an
interim work authorization document while it considers his or her application. However, this would encourage people
to file merely to get a document to enter the labor market. Under such circumstances, it would be inappropriate for
the Service to give a benefit before having an opportunity to determine if the person is actually eligible for it. Instead,
the Service is taking steps to accelerate the processing of this type of application in order to deliver a replacement
card more rapidly to those who are eligible.
Several commenters pointed to the situation of permanent residents in exclusion or deportation proceedings, and
suggested that the rule should clearly prohibit the confiscation of the permanent resident alien registration card
until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered. The rule has been clarified to indicate that such a person
is entitled to evidence of permanent resident status until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered.
As requested by several commenters, the Service has modified the proposed rule to clearly allow for the concurrent
or subsequent filing of an application for further action on an application or petition, and to provide flexibility
to incorporate additional, similar processes by revising the form. The Service has also made minor editorial changes
in the rule for clarity.
One commenter suggested that to further streamline processing, the Service should require applicants to mail all
adjustment of status applications to the INS Service Centers, and eliminate the mandatory interview requirement.
The Service has since addressed this issue in a separate rulemaking, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 2, 1992 at 57 FR 49374-49375.
It should be noted that most of the  264 items addressed in the proposed rule were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 20, 1993 at 58 FR 48775-48780, and therefore are not included in this rule. 

In addressing filing requirements and procedures, this rule also clarifies the effect of a ``bounced'' check or other
filing fee remittance being returned as not payable.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation
merely sets forth evidentiary rules and processes by which persons may apply for and receive certain immigration
benefits and does not alter substantive requirements. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning
of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Clearance numbers for these collections are contained
in 8 CFR 299.5, Display of Control Numbers.

2. In section 103.2 paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: 



 103.2 



Applications, petitions, and other documents. 



(a) 

Filing. 

(1) 

General. 

Every application, petition, appeal, motion, request, or other document submitted on the form prescribed by this
chapter shall be executed and filed in accordance with the instructions on the form, such instructions being hereby
incorporated into the particular section of the regulations requiring its submission. The form must be filed with
the appropriate filing fee required by  103.7. Such fees are non-refundable and, except as otherwise provided
in this chapter, must be paid when the application or petition is filed. 

(2) 

Signature.

 An applicant or petitioner must sign his or her application or petition. However, a parent or legal guardian may sign
for a person who is less than 14 years old. A legal guardian may sign for a mentally incompetent person. By signing the
application or petition, the applicant or petitioner, or parent or guardian certifies under penalty of perjury that
the application or petition, and all evidence submitted with it, either at the time of filing or thereafter, is true
and correct. 

(3) 

Representation.

 An applicant or petitioner may be represented by an attorney in the United States, as defined in  1.1(f) of this
chapter, by an attorney outside the United States as defined in  292.1(a)(6) of this chapter, or by an accredited
representative as defined in  292.1(a)(4) of this chapter. A beneficiary of a petition is not a recognized party
in such a proceeding. An application or petition presented in person by someone who is not the applicant or petitioner,
or his or her representative as defined in this paragraph, shall be treated as if received through the mail, and the
person advised that the applicant or petitioner, and his or her representative, will be notified of the decision.
Where a notice of representation is submitted that is not properly signed, the application or petition will be processed
as if the notice had not been submitted. 

(4) 

Oath.

 Any required oath may be administered by an immigration officer or person generally authorized to administer oaths,
including persons so authorized by Article 136 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

(5) 

Translation of name.

 If a document has been executed in an anglicized version of a name, the native form of the name may also be required.

(6) 

Where to file.

 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an application or petition should be filed with the INS office or Service
Center with jurisdiction over the application or petition and the place of residence of the applicant or petitioner
as indicated in the instructions with the respective form. 

(7) 

Receipt date.

 (i) 

General. 

An application or petition received in a Service office shall be stamped to show the time and date of actual receipt
and, unless otherwise specified in part 204 or part 245 of this chapter, shall be regarded as filed when so stamped,
if it is properly signed and executed and the required fee is attached or a fee waiver is granted. An application which
is not properly signed or is submitted with the wrong fee shall be rejected as improperly filed. Rejected applications,
and ones in which the check or other financial instrument is returned as not payable, will not retain a filing date.
An application or petition taken to a local Service office for the completion of biometric information prior to filing
at a Service Center shall be considered received when physically received at the appropriate Service Center. 

(ii) 

Non-payment.

 If a check or other financial instrument used to pay a filing fee is subsequently returned as not payable, the remitter
shall be notified and requested to immediately pay the filing fee and associated service charge within 14 days, without
extension. If the application or petition is pending and these charges are not paid, it shall be rejected as improperly
filed. If it was already approved, and these charges are not paid, it shall be automatically revoked because it was
improperly filed. If it was already denied, revoked, or abandoned, that decision will not be affected by the non-payment
of the filing fee. A new fee will be required with any new application or petition. Any fee and service charges collected
as the result of collection activities or legal action on the prior application or petition shall be used to cover the
cost of the previous rejection, revocation, or other action.

 103.2



Applications, petitions, and other documents. 



* * * * *



(b) 

Evidence and processing. 

(1) 

General.

 An applicant or petitioner must establish eligibility for a requested immigration benefit. An application or petition
form must be completed as applicable and filed with any initial evidence required by regulation or by the instructions
on the form. Any evidence submitted is considered part of the relating application or petition. 

(2) 

Submitting secondary evidence and affidavits. 

(i) 

General.

 The non-existence or other unavailability of required evidence creates a presumption of ineligibility. If a required
document, such as a birth or marriage certificate, does not exist or cannot be obtained, an applicant or petitioner
must demonstrate this and submit secondary evidence, such as church or school records, pertinent to the facts at issue.
If secondary evidence also does not exist or cannot be obtained, the applicant or petitioner must demonstrate the
unavailability of both the required document and relevant secondary evidence, and submit two or more affidavits,
sworn to or affirmed by persons who are not parties to the petition who have direct personal knowledge of the event and
circumstances. Secondary evidence must overcome the unavailability of primary evidence, and affidavits must overcome
the unavailability of both primary and secondary evidence. 

(ii) 

Demonstrating that a record is not available.

 Where a record does not exist, the applicant or petitioner must submit an original written statement on government
letterhead establishing this from the relevant government or other authority. The statement must indicate the reason
the record does not exist, and indicate whether similar records for the time and place are available. However, a certification
from an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's
Foreign Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An applicant or petitioner who has
not been able to acquire the necessary document or statement from the relevant foreign authority may submit evidence
that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain the required document or statement. However, where the Service
finds that such documents or statements are generally available, it may require that the applicant or petitioner
submit the required document or statement. 

(3) 

Translations.

 Any document containing foreign language submitted to the Service shall be accompanied by a full English language
translation which the translator has certified as complete and accurate, and by the translator's certification
that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into English. 

(4) 

Submitting copies of documents.

 Application and petition forms must be submitted in the original. Forms and documents issued to support an application
or petition, such as labor certifications, Form IAP-66, medical examinations, affidavits, formal consultations,
and other statements, must be submitted in the original unless previously filed with the Service. When submission
is required, expired Service documents must be submitted in the original, as must Service documents required to be
annotated to indicate the decision. In all other instances, unless the relevant regulations or instructions specifically
require that an original document be filed with an application or petition, an ordinary legible photocopy may be submitted.
Original documents submitted when not required will remain a part of the record, even if the submission was not required.


(5) 

Request for an original document.

 Where a copy of a document is submitted with an application or petition, the Service may at any time require that the
original document be submitted for review. If the requested original, other than one issued by the Service, is not
submitted within 12 weeks, the petition or application shall be denied or revoked. There shall be no appeal from a denial
or revocation based on the failure to submit an original document upon the request of the Service to substantiate a
previously submitted copy. Further, an applicant or petitioner may not move to reopen or reconsider the proceeding
based on the subsequent availability of the document. An original document submitted pursuant to a Service request
shall be returned to the petitioner or applicant when no longer required.

(6) 

Withdrawal. 

An applicant or petitioner may withdraw an application or petition at any time until a decision is issued by the Service
or, in the case of an approved petition, until the person is admitted or granted adjustment or change of status, based
on the petition. However, a withdrawal may not be retracted. 

(7) 

Testimony. 

The Service may require the taking of testimony, and may direct any necessary investigation. When a statement is taken
from and signed by a person, he or she shall, upon request, be given a copy without fee. Any allegations made subsequent
to filing an application or petition which are in addition to, or in substitution for, those originally made, shall
be filed in the same manner as the original application, petition, or document, and acknowledged under oath thereon.


(8) 

Request for evidence. 

If there is evidence of ineligibility in the record, an application or petition shall be denied on that basis notwithstanding
any lack of required initial evidence. If the application or petition was pre-screened by the Service prior to filing
and was filed even though the applicant or petitioner was informed that the required initial evidence was missing,
the application or petition shall be denied for failure to contain the necessary evidence. Except as otherwise provided
in this chapter, in other instances where there is no evidence of ineligibility, and initial evidence or eligibility
information is missing or the Service finds that the evidence submitted either does not fully establish eligibility
for the requested benefit or raises underlying questions regarding eligibility, the Service shall request the missing
initial evidence, and may request additional evidence, including blood tests. In such cases, the applicant or petitioner
shall be given 12 weeks to respond to a request for evidence. Additional time may not be granted. Within this period
the applicant or petitioner may:
(i) Submit all the requested initial or additional evidence;
(ii) Submit some or none of the requested additional evidence and ask for a decision based on the record; or
(iii) Withdraw the application or petition.
(9) 

Request for appearance. 

An applicant, a petitioner, and/or a beneficiary may be required to appear for an interview. A petitioner shall also
be notified when an interview notice is mailed or issued to a beneficiary. The person may appear as requested by the
Service or, prior to the date and time of the interview: 

(i) The person to be interviewed may, for good cause, request that the interview be rescheduled; or 

(ii) The applicant or petitioner may withdraw the application or petition.
(10) 

Effect of a request for initial or additional evidence or for interview rescheduling. 

(i) 

Effect on processing. 

The priority date of a properly filed petition shall not be affected by a request for missing initial evidence or request
for other evidence. If an application or petition is missing required initial evidence, or an applicant, petitioner,
or beneficiary requests that an interview be rescheduled, any time period imposed on Service processing will start
over from the date of receipt of the required initial evidence or request for interview rescheduling. If the Service
requests that the applicant or petitioner submit additional evidence or respond to other than a request for initial
evidence, any time limitation imposed on the Service for processing will be suspended as of the date of the request.
It will resume at the same point where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or response, or a
request for a decision based on the evidence submitted.

(ii) 

Effect on interim benefits. 

Interim benefits will not be granted based on an application or petition held in suspense for the submission of requested
initial evidence, except that the applicant or beneficiary will normally be allowed to remain while an application
or petition to extend or obtain status while in the United States is pending. The Service may choose to pursue other
actions to seek removal of a person notwithstanding the pending application. Employment authorization previously
accorded based on the same status and employment as that requested in the current application or petition may continue
uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20) during the suspense period. 

(11) 

Submission of evidence in response to a Service request. 

All evidence submitted in response to a Service request must be submitted at one time. The submission of only some of
the requested evidence will be considered a request for a decision based on the record. 

(12) 

Effect where evidence submitted in response to a request does not establish eligibility at the time of filing. 

An application or petition shall be denied where evidence submitted in response to a request for initial evidence
does not establish filing eligibility at the time the application or petition was filed. An application or petition
shall be denied where any application or petition upon which it was based was filed subsequently. 

(13) 

Effect of failure to respond to a request for evidence or appearance. 

If all requested initial evidence and requested additional evidence is not submitted by the required date, the application
or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied. Except as provided in  335.6 of
this chapter, if a person requested to appear for an interview does not appear, the Service does not receive his or her
request for rescheduling by the date of the interview, or the applicant or petitioner has not withdrawn the application
or petition, the application or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied. 

(14) 

Effect of request for decision. 

When an applicant or petitioner does not submit all requested additional evidence and requests a decision based on
the evidence already submitted, a decision shall be issued based on the record. Failure to submit requested evidence
which precludes a material line of inquiry shall be grounds for denying the application or petition. Failure to appear
for a required interview, or to give required testimony, shall result in the denial of any related application or petition.


(15) 

Effect of withdrawal or denial due to abandonment. 

The Service's acknowledgement of a withdrawal may not be appealed. A denial due to abandonment may not be appealed,
but an applicant or petitioner may file a motion to reopen under  103.5. Withdrawal or denial due to abandonment
does not preclude the filing of a new application or petition with a new fee. However, the priority or processing date
of a withdrawn or abandoned application or petition may not be applied to a later application petition. Withdrawal
or denial due to abandonment shall not itself affect the new proceeding; but the facts and circumstances surrounding
the prior application or petition shall otherwise be material to the new application or petition. 


* * * * * 



(17) 

Verifying claimed permanent resident status. 

The status of an applicant or petitioner who claims that he or she is a permanent resident of the United States will be
verified from official records of the Service. The term official records, as used herein, includes Service files,
arrival manifests, arrival records, Service index cards, Immigrant Identification Cards, Certificates of Registry,
Declarations of Intention issued after July 1, 1929, Alien Registration Receipt Cards Forms AR-3, AR-103,
I-151 or I-551), passports, and reentry permits. To constitute an official record a Service index card
must bear a designated immigrant visa symbol and must have been prepared by an authorized official of the Service in
the course of processing immigrant admissions or adjustments to permanent resident status. Other cards, certificates,
declarations, permits, and passports must have been issued or endorsed by the Service to show admission for permanent
residence. Except as otherwise provided in 8 CFR part 101, and in the absence of countervailing evidence, such official
records shall be regarded as establishing lawful admission for permanent residence. 


* * * * * 



(19) 

Notification. 

An applicant or petitioner shall be sent a written decision on his or her application, petition, motion, or appeal.
Where the applicant or petitioner has authorized representation pursuant to  103.2(a), that representative
shall also be notified. Documents produced after an approval notice is sent, such as an alien registration card, shall
be mailed directly to the applicant or petitioner. 


* * * * * 



4. Section 103.5 is amended by: 

a. Revising, in paragraph (a)(1)(i), the reference to ``part 242 of this chapter'', to read: ``8 CFR parts 210, 242,
or 245a''; 

b. Adding, to the end of paragraph (a)(1)(i), a new sentence; 

c. Revising the first sentence in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) introductory text; 

d. Revising paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(C);

Reopening or reconsideration. 



(a) * * * 
(1) * * * 
(i) * * * Any motion to reconsider an action by the Service filed by an applicant or petitioner must be filed within 30
days of the decision that the motion seeks to reconsider. Any motion to reopen a proceeding before the Service filed
by an applicant or petitioner, must be filed within 30 days of the decision that the motion seeks to reopen, except that
failure to file before this period expires, may be excused in the discretion of the Service where it is demonstrated
that the delay was reasonable and was beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner. 


* * * * * 



(iii) 

Filing Requirements_

A motion shall be submitted on Form I-290A, and may be accompanied by a brief. * * *

* * * * * 



(2) 

Requirements for motion to reopen. 

A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be provided in the reopened proceeding and be supported by affidavits
or other documentary evidence. A motion to reopen an application or petition denied due to abandonment must be filed
with evidence that the decision was in error because: 

(i) The requested evidence was not material to the issue of eligibility; 

(ii) The required initial evidence was submitted with the application or petition, or the request for initial evidence
or additional information or appearance was complied with during the allotted period; or 

(iii) The request for additional information or appearance was sent to an address other than that on the application,
petition, or notice of representation, or that the applicant or petitioner advised the Service, in writing, of a change
of address or change of representation subsequent to filing and before the Service's request was sent, and the request
did not go to the new address. 

(3) 

Requirements for motion to reconsider. 

A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions
to establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or Service policy. A motion to reconsider
a decision on an application or petition must, when filed, also establish that the decision was incorrect based on
the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision. 

(4) 

Processing motions in proceedings before the Service. 

A motion that does not meet applicable requirements shall be dismissed. Where a motion to reopen is granted, the proceeding
shall be reopened. The notice and any favorable decision may be combined. 


* * * * * 



(8) 

Treating an appeal as a motion. 

The official who denied an application or petition may treat the appeal from that decision as a motion for the purpose
of granting the motion. 


* * * * *

Application for further action on an approved application or petition.



(a) 

General.

 An application for further action on an approved application or petition must be filed on Form I-824 by the applicant
or petitioner who filed the original application or petition. It must be filed with the fee required in  103.7
and the initial evidence required on the application form. Form I-824 may accompany the original application
or petition, or may be filed after the approval of the original application or petition.

(b) 

Requested actions.

 A person whose application was approved may, during its validity period, apply for a duplicate approval notice or
any other action specifically provided for on the form. A petitioner whose petition was approved may, during the validity
of the petition, request that the Service:

(1) Issue a duplicate approval notice;

(2) Notify another consulate of the approved petition;

(3) Notify a consulate of the person's adjustment of status for the purpose of visa issuance to dependents; or

(4) Take any other action specifically provided for on the form.

(c) 

Processing. 

The application shall be approved if the Service determines the applicant has fully demonstrated eligibility for
the requested action. There is no appeal from the denial of an application filed on Form I-824.

(2) 

Filing on Form I-539

. Any other nonimmigrant alien, except an alien in F or J status who has been granted duration of status, who seeks to
extend his or her stay beyond the currently authorized period of admission, must apply for an extension of stay on Form
I-539 with the fee required in  103.7 of this chapter together with any initial evidence specified in the

where the co-applicants are all members of a single family group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or
one holds a nonimmigrant status and the other co-applicants are his or her spouse and/or children who hold derivative
nonimmigrant status based on his or her status. Extensions granted to members of a family group must be for the same
period of time. The shortest period granted to any member of the family shall be granted to all members of the family.

such status expired before the application or petition was filed, except that failure to file before the period of
previously authorized status expired may be excused in the discretion of the Service and without separate application,
with any extension granted from the date the previously authorized stay expired, where it is demonstrated at the time
of filing that:

(i) The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service
finds the delay commensurate with the circumstances; 

(ii) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant status;

(iii) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and

Waiver of Certain Types of Visas 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations to permit district directors,
acting alone, to waive a nonimmigrant visa or passport under section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act in individual cases, if satisfied that a nonimmigrant alien is unable to present these documents because of an
unforeseen emergency. Formerly, in such circumstances the district director was required to seek concurrence of
the Department of State Visa Office to grant a waiver of the nonimmigrant visa or passport. In eliminating the step
of seeking concurrence on each waiver, this amendment will save resources for both agencies and reduce the time it
takes to admit certain nonimmigrant aliens.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of State and the Attorney General,
acting jointly, to waive a nonimmigrant alien's visa or passport when an alien is unable to present the required documents
due to an unforeseen emergency. Previously, when such a nonimmigrant appeared at a port of entry, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service district director was required to seek the concurrence of the Department of State Visa
Office prior to granting the waiver. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the Commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service by title 8 U.S.C. section 103 and to the Director of the Visa Office of the Department of State
by title 8 U.S.C. section 104, the Commissioner and the Director of the Visa Office, acting jointly, determined that
the previous procedure was unnecessarily burdensome. Officers of the Department of State concurred with the recommendations
from the ports of entry in over 95% of the cases presented. Having the district director exercise the function of the
Department of State Visa Office simultaneously with the function assigned to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service will save resources for both agencies and result in a quicker admission of the alien. If the district director
is satisfied that the alien failed to present a passport or a visa because of an unforeseen emergency and that the alien
should be granted the waiver, then the procedure at the ports of entry will remain the same. The alien will fill out an
application for the waiver, the information will be checked, and a fee will be charged. The Department of State is promulgating
a similar regulation that amends  41.2 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations. 




The Immigration and Naturalization Service (The Service) published a proposed rule, with a request for comments,
in the 

Federal Register

 on July 30, 1991, at 56 FR 36028, amending 8 CFR 212.1(g). The comment period ended on August 29, 1991. The Service received
three comments. One commentor endorsed the rule's practicality but recommended a change in language in the phrase
``unable to obtain the required documents'' so that it reads ``unable to present the required documents''. The Service
agrees that the change improves the rule by allowing waivers to be granted in cases where the alien possesses the required
documents but cannot produce them at the port of entry. This change is incorporated in the final rule. 

Another commentor expressed concern that language in the proposed regulation might mislead a reader to think that
the Service will seek concurrence from the Visa Office without first determining that the alien is entitled to a waiver
of documents. Such a procedure would be a deviation from the Service's past practice rather than a continuation of
it, as the Service intends, except for eliminating the step of seeking concurrence from the Department of State Visa
Office. Language in the final rule has been changed to clarify this point.

Another commentor noted that transportation companies cannot board an alien passenger traveling in emergency circumstances
who lacks the required documents without incurring a fine at the port of entry. The commentor recommended adding a
provision to the rule which would specify the steps a carrier must take to board such a passenger without incurring
a fine. This rule is not intended to expand the circumstances under which an alien may apply for a waiver of documents,
only to simplify the administrative procedure for granting a waiver, and therefore the recommendation will not be
incorporated into the final rule.




In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
merely reflects an agreement reached between the Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service
that results in a less burdensome administrative procedure. In addition, members of the public are serviced in a more
expeditious manner as a result of the effect of this rule.


This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications
warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.




The information collection requirement contained in this rule has been cleared by the Office of Management and Budget
under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control number for this collection is contained in 8 CFR
299.5.

of entry that, because of an unforeseen emergency, he or she is unable to present the required documents, in which case
a waiver application shall be made on Form I-193. The district director may approve a waiver of documents in each
case in which he or she is satisfied that the nonimmigrant cannot present the required documents because of an unforeseen
emergency and the waiver would be appropriate in the circumstances. * * *

Temporary Alien Workers Seeking H-1B Classification Under the Immigration and Nationality Act



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule implements certain provisions of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization
Amendments of 1991 (MTINA) by establishing petitioning procedures for H-1B nonimmigrants and new eligibility
criteria for foreign physicians seeking employment in the medical professions in the United States. This rule contains
the new procedures required by the legislation and makes Service policy consistent with the intent of Congress. This
rule sets forth the new filing procedures and eligibility standards and clarifies for businesses, academic institutions,
and the general public the requirements for classification and admission under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (ACT).





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101-649, November 29, 1990, dramatically altered the H-1B
nonimmigrant classification. IMMACT, among other things, removed prominent aliens from the H-1B nonimmigrant
classification and required prospective employers to obtain an approved labor condition application from the Department
of Labor prior to the admission of the H-1B nonimmigrant into the United States.



In response to concerns raised by a number of interested parties, Congress incorporated numerous provisions in the
Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Public Law 102-232, December
12, 1991, which amended some of the provisions created by IMMACT. Specifically, Public Law 102-232 amended
the definition of an H-1B nonimmigrant alien by removing the requirement that the intending employer obtain
an approved labor condition application prior to the alien's admission into the United States, amended the criteria
which the Secretary of Labor could use in invoking the penalty provisions relating to misrepresentations and omissions
on the labor condition application, and, lastly, addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States
to perform services in the medical profession.

On April 9, 1992, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 at 57 FR 12177, an interim rule with requests for comments to incorporate the changes contained in Public Law 102-232.
Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before June 8, 1992.



Discussion of Comments on the Interim Regulations



The Service received comments from sixteen individuals on the interim rule. Some of the commenters addressed more
than one issue in their comments. A number of commenters offered suggestions and improvements for the final rule,
many of which have been adopted in the final rule. The following discussion addresses the issues raised, provides
the Service's position on the issues, and, indicates the revisions adopted in the final rule based on the public's
comments.



Labor Condition Application_ 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)(

1

)



Prior to the passage of Public Law 102-232, petitioners in H-1B cases were required to submit a copy of an
approved labor condition application with the petition. Public Law 102-232 amended this language by requiring
only that petitioners attach a certification from the Secretary of Labor indicating that the petitioner has filed
a labor condition application with the Secretary of Labor. The interim rule contained language reflecting this amendment
to the statute.

One commenter suggested that a petitioner could meet this statutory requirement by merely submitting a copy of the
labor condition application without waiting for the Department of Labor to certify the labor condition application.
However, submitting a copy of the labor condition application is not sufficient to show that the application has been
filed. Only when the application has been certified can the Service be assured that the petitioner has complied with
the filing requirement. Therefore, the Service did not adopt this recommendation.

One commenter noted that IMMACT imposed a number of penalties on employers who failed to meet certain conditions of
the labor condition application process. Section 212(n)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act states that in those situations the
Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed by the offending employer under section 204 or 214(c) of the Act
for a period of one year. The commenter noted that  214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)(

5

) of the interim regulation indicated only that the Attorney General shall not approve petitions under the H-1B
category. In response to this comment the final rule will be amended to indicate that this provision applies to petitions
filed under both sections 204 and 214(c) of the Act as required by statute.

Return Transportation Provision_ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(E) and  214.2(h)(6)(vi)(E)


One commenter suggested that petitioners in H-1B and H-2B cases should be required to post a bond in order
to prove to the Service that the return transportation requirement will be met. It is the opinion of the Service that
the statute and regulations clearly state the requirement that a petitioner in these instances is responsible for
the alien beneficiary's return transportation. The filing of the petition is sufficient assurance to the Service
that the petitioner will comply with this requirement.


Criteria and Documentary Requirements for Physicians_ 214.2(h)(4)(viii)


Prior to the passage of IMMACT, alien graduates of foreign medical schools were excluded from classification as H-1B
nonimmigrants unless they were coming to the United States pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private
educational or research institution or agency to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for such institution or
agency. These physicians were not authorized to perform direct patient care unless it was incidental to the teaching
or research. This restriction, however, was not contained in IMMACT, thereby allowing graduates of foreign medical
schools to perform direct patient care in the United States.
Public Law 102-232 addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States to perform services
in the medical profession. The legislation provided that these aliens could obtain H-1B classification in
either of two ways.
First (mirroring the pre-IMMACT statutory language), an alien may be accorded H-1B classification if the alien
is coming to the United States pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private educational or research
institution or agency to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for such institution or agency.
Second, an alien may be accorded H-1B classification if he or she has passed the Federation Licensing Examination
(FLEX) or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Eligibility under
this criterion also requires a demonstration that the alien has competency in oral and written English or that the
alien has graduated from a school of medicine accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary
of Education.
In the preamble to the interim rule, it was stated that there was no distinction between alien physicians educated
in the United States and those educated abroad and that both had to pass the Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX)
in order to be classified as an H-1B nonimmigrant in order to perform direct patient care.
Three commenters stated that the FLEX requirement should not be applicable to alien graduates of United States medical
schools since, over the previous decade, the Service has consistently permitted these aliens to engage in direct
patient care under the H-1B classification. These commenters also noted that graduates of United States medical
schools are not normally required to take the FLEX examination as part of their training and licensing requirements.
Subsequent to the publication of the interim rule, the Service altered its position on this issue, reaffirming that
the FLEX requirement did not apply to aliens educated at United States medical schools. This position now will be codified
in the final rule. It should be noted, however, that the FLEX requirement does apply to aliens educated in foreign medical
schools, including schools in Canada. The final rule will be amended to reflect the Service's present position.
Two commenters noted that aliens of national or international renown in the field of medicine, pursuant to section
101(a)(41) of the Act, are not considered graduates of a medical school and should be exempt for the FLEX requirement.
The Service agrees with this comment and the final rule will be amended to indicate that aliens of national or international
renown in the field of medicine are exempt from the FLEX requirement as well as the other requirements set forth in section
212(j)(2) of the Act. They are, however, required to meet the licensure requirements for the state of intended employment.

Equivalency to the FLEX 



Public Law 102-232 provides that alien physicians who wish to perform patient care in the United States must,
among other things, pass the FLEX examination or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services. By notice published on September 16, 1992 at 57 FR 42755, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
designated Parts I, II, and III of the National Board of Medical Examiners certifying examinations and the Steps 1,
2, and 3 examinations of the United States Medical Licensing Examinations program as equivalent to the FLEX. 

Six commenters suggested that the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), the Canadian medical licensing
procedure, or a State license should also be determined to be equivalent to the FLEX. A determination that the LMCC
or a state license is equivalent to the FLEX is outside the scope of the Service's authority. 



Competency in the English Language 



Public Law 102-232 also requires that graduates of medical schools coming to the United States to perform services
in the medical professions must demonstrate competency in oral and written English or be a graduate of a school of medicine
accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Education. The interim rule contains the
requirement that a petitioner may demonstrate English competency by submitting evidence that the alien has passed
the English test given by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). The interim regulation
did not contain any additional tests or mechanisms to establish competency in the English language but it was stated
in the preamble to the interim rule that the Service would consider other suggestions to demonstrate competency.


Two commenters suggested that the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) should be recognized as an alternate
test to establish English competency. Since the results of the TOEFL are reported as a raw score which must be interpreted
by the entity reviewing the score, and the administrators of the test have not established a passing grade for the test,
the Service cannot adopt this suggestion since it does not have the expertise or resources to interpret this test.


Two commenters also suggested that the Service recognize that graduates of medical schools located in an English-speaking
country in which the language of instruction is also English have competency in the English language. Since the statutory
language already addresses the issue of language competency in relation to graduation from certain universities,
the adoption of this suggestion would be in conflict with the statutory language. 



Licensure



The interim rule requires that a petition for a physician coming to the United States to perform services in the medical
profession must be accompanied by evidence that the physician has a license or authorization required by the State
of intended employment, if the state requires such license or authorization. This language was adopted to ensure
that at the time the petition was filed the physician and met the regulatory requirements relating to the practice
of medicine in the state of intended employment. The regulation also recognizes that, in certain instances, a state
may not require a physician to obtain an actual medical license in order to perform the duties of a particular position.


Two commenters suggested that the regulations of the state of intended employment should dictate which type of license,
if any, should be required by the Service. This suggested regulatory change is unnecessary since it is already provided
for in the language of the interim rule at  214.2(h)(4)(viii)(A)(

1

).

One commenter also noted that certain physicians employer by the United States government, such as the Veterans Administration,
are not required to possess a license issued by the state of intended employment hut merely require a license from any
state. The final rule has been amended to accommodate this situation.

One commenter suggested that an alien physician should not be required to obtain a medical license if the alien is not
coming to the United States to perform patient care. As written, the interim rule requires that licensure must be obtained
only in those situations where the alien beneficiary will be performing clinical care. An alien physician coming
to fill a position which does not normally require licensure, e.g., medical research, would not be required to obtain
a license. Thus, this suggestion need not be adopted.



Approval and Validity of Petitions_ 214.2(h)(9)(iii)(B)



The initial approval of an H-1B petition is currently limited to three years. One commenter suggested that H-1B
petitions should be approved for the validity period of the supporting labor condition application, not to exceed
six years. The Service does not deem it appropriate to consider extending the initial validity period of H-1B
petitions without first soliciting public comment on the issue. This issue will be addressed in a future proposed
rule.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
merely clarifies provisions of the MTINA which establish certain new petitioning procedures for H-1B nonimmigrants
and new eligibility criteria for foreign physicians seeking employment in the medical profession in this country,
and therefore has a 

de minimus

 economic impact on small entities. This rule is not considered to be significant within section 3(f) of E.O. 12866,
nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance
with E.O. 12612.

Determination of Public Charges for Legalization Benefits, Amendment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) relating to applications
for lawful temporary residence under section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, this rule
amends the special rule for determination of public charge to provide that aliens who are self-supporting despite
earning income below the poverty level may be admissible without having to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under
8 CFR 245a.2(k) (2). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 27, 1993, the Immigration and Naturalization Service published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 45235-45236, an interim rule with request for comments to amend 8 CFR part 245a. The interim rule was issued
to remove language that had been inadvertently added in a previous final rule which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 12, 1989, at 54 FR 29449. Specifically, the interim rule clarified that persons described in the special rule
for determination of public charge are in fact admissible without having to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility.
The Service received two comments on the interim rule, both of which viewed the amendment favorably, noting that the
amendment brought the regulation in conformity with section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule provides a benefit for individual aliens. It
does not affect small entities. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order
12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in
accordance with Executive Order 12612. 



List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 245a 



Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 




Accordingly, the interim rule amending part 245a of chapter I of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations which was
published at 58 FR 45235-45236 on August 27, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change.

Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL-600-2B19 ``Regional Jet'' Series 100 Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Canadair Model CL-600-2B19
``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes. This action requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to limit
altitude and airspeed operations of the airplane under certain conditions of hydraulic system failure. This amendment
is prompted by a report of sheared-off shear pins found on one airplane's elevator dampers. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent undampened vibration of the elevators in normal cruise conditions when combined
with hydraulic system failures, a condition which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL-600-2B19 ``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes. Transport
Canada Aviation advises that one operator of these airplanes found that the shear pins on the airplane elevator dampers
had sheared off. This finding was made during a routine check of the airplane. The cause of the pin failure has not been
determined. Failure of the shear pins on the elevator damper, if not detected and corrected, may lead to undampened
vibration of the elevators during normal cruise conditions when combined with hydraulic system failures. This situation
could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 



This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. 

In order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada, Transport Canada Aviation issued a Canadian
airworthiness directive on December 17, 1993, that restricts operation of these airplanes to certain altitude and
airspeed limits under various conditions of hydraulic system failure. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport
Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of
this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent undampened vibration of the elevators during
normal cruise conditions in the event of hydraulic system failures, which could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM) to restrict altitude and airspeed operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic failure. 

This is considered interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider additional
rulemaking. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-NM-230-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

Visas: Documentation of Nonimmigrants Under the Immigration and Nationality Act; Waiver by Secretary of State and
Attorney General of Passport and/or Visa Requirements for Certain Categories of Nonimmigrants 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Consular Affairs, DOS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule authorizes the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to exercise the Department
of State's function with respect to the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement under the provisions of section
212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The rule eliminates time consuming procedures for obtaining
the concurrence of passport and/or visa waivers, and benefits certain nonimmigrant aliens who, because of unforeseen
circumstances, are subjected to delays when seeking admission to the United States without the required documents.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 30, 1991, the Department of State published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 36029. The rule proposed
to amend part 41,  41.2(j), which provided for the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement by the District
Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at the port of entry, with the concurrence of the designated
State Department official, if such officials were satisfied that the nonimmigrant alien was unable to obtain the
required documentation because of an unforeseen emergency. This final rule authorizes the District Director of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the port of entry to exercise the Department of State's function with
respect to the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement under the provisions of INA 212(d)(4)(A). 



Comment 



During the comment period the Department received only one comment. The commenting organization noted that under
the proposed regulations nonimmigrants who are ``unable to obtain'' the required documents may benefit from such
a waiver. The commenter suggested that the proposed language be amended to read ``unable to present'' the required
documents. 

A review of the historical files reveals that the language in question has been in use since at least 1958. The focus
at that time was on fact patterns in which the alien indeed could not for geographical, political, and other reasons
obtain the required documents. Circumstances have changed radically since that time. The Department believes that
the recommendation to change the word ``obtain'' to read ``present'' has merit as it more accurately reflects current
world circumstances and the intent of the statute. In order to gain admission to the United States an alien must present
the required pertinent documentation, whether one has the ability or not to obtain such. Absent such documentation,
the immigration officer in charge at the port of entry must decide whether the applicant for admission is indeed qualified
for the desired nonimmigrant visa classification and whether the inability to present the required documentation
was due to an unforeseen emergency. 

Furthermore, the Department wishes to clarify the limited extent of the authority delegated to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Although the proposed rule permits the District Director to waive the documentary requirements
of INA 212(a)(7)(B), the Department of State will continue to exercise the authority vested in the Secretary of State
and the Attorney General under the provisions of INA 212(d)(4)(A) relating to the joint concurrence in documentary
waivers, except in the circumstances described in  41.2(j) of this final rule. Consequently, this final rule
makes minor modifications to the text of the regulation as discussed in the preamble. 

This final rule is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291 nor is it expected to have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition,
this rule does not impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980. This rule has been revised as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. 



List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 41 



Aliens, Documentation, Nonimmigrants, Passport and visas, Waivers.

 

Accordingly, 22 CFR part 41 is amended as follows: 



PART 41_[AMENDED] 



1. The authority citation for part 41 continues to read as follows:

 




Authority:

 Sec. 104, 66 Stat. 174, 8 U.S.C. 1104; Sec. 109(b)(1), 91 Stat. 847. 




2. In  41.2, paragraph (j) is revised to read as follows: 



 41.2 

Waiver by Secretary of State and Attorney General of passport and/or visa requirements for certain categories of
nonimmigrants. 



* * * * * 



(j) 

Individual cases of unforeseen emergencies. 

A visa and passport are not required of an alien if, either prior to the alien's embarkation abroad or upon arrival at
a port of entry, the responsible district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in charge of the
port of entry concludes that the alien is unable to present the required documents because of an unforeseen emergency.
Any waiver of the visa or passport requirement may be granted by the INS district director pursuant to INA 212(d)(4)(A)
without the prior concurrence of the Department of State in each case in which the district director concludes that
the alien's claim of emergency circumstances is legitimate and bona fide and that approval of the waiver would be appropriate
under all of the attendant facts and circumstances.

GNMA Requests for Full Insurance on Coinsurance Loans 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule revises currently applicable multifamily and health facility coinsurance regulations to eliminate the
requirement that the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer
responsibility on current coinsured mortgages held by a defaulting lender-issuer before requesting full insurance
endorsement by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The purpose of the rule is to eliminate a current regulatory
requirement which has proved to be time-consuming and, in most cases, unnecessary.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department's former regulations concerning GNMA's right to assignment of coinsured mortgages were found at
24 CFR 251.827 (Multifamily Coinsurance_New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation),  252.827 (Coinsurance
of Nursing Homes and Related Facilities), and  255.827 (Coinsurance of Mortgages Covering Existing Multifamily
Projects), before their recent removal as part of the termination of the Coinsurance program sections on right to
assignment provided that, for any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer,
GNMA will first attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender by soliciting offers
to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring
lenders that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner and that are also
GNMA issuers. If GNMA rejects all offers or no offers are received, GNMA will then have the right to perfect an assignment
of the Mortgage to itself. The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as provided by this section
for full insurance effective as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of title 24
of the Code of Federal Regulations.

On October 10, 1990, a final rule was published (55 FR 41312) terminating the FHA multifamily coinsurance programs
and revising parts 251, 252 and 255. As a result of the final rule, parts 251, 252 and 255 each now consist of a single section
dealing with the program phase-out process. However, while the former rule's provisions are no longer included in
the Code of Federal Regulations, those regulations in effect before November 12, 1990 continue to govern the rights
and obligations of mortgagors, coinsuring lenders and HUD in existence before the termination of the coinsurance
programs. The effect of this rule is to revise those regulations as they relate to the handling of mortgage assignments
to GNMA.

On December 15, 1992 the Department published a proposed rule (57 FR 59314) identical in text to this final rule. No
comments were received from the public concerning this proposed rule.

In lieu of the above-quoted paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), this rule provides that ``For any Coinsured Mortgage that
is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the
mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another
eligible coinsuring lender (unless it determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner, that the attempt would
prove ineffectual because of market or other conditions). The assignment will be attempted by soliciting offers
to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring
lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the
Commissioner.''

Given the facts that (a) the authority to coinsure mortgages has been terminated; (b) for the most part, no market exists
for the purchase of coinsurance servicing rights; and (c) none of the few remaining approved coinsuring lenders has
shown any interest to date in assuming additional coinsuring risk by assignment of loans from GNMA, implementation
of the regulatory requirement earlier set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) has proved to be a time-consuming,
burdensome and fruitless process. Therefore, this rule amends parts 251, 252 and 255 to eliminate the requirement
that GNMA, in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer responsibility on current coinsured mortgages
before perfecting assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage to itself and requesting full insurance endorsement by FHA.



Procedural Matters



Executive Order 12866



This final rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget as a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993.
Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are a part of the public docket file in the office of the Rules Docket
Clerk listed at the beginning of this preamble.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is procedural
in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies.

This rule was listed as item number 1540 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) under Executive order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Executive Order 12612, Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule do not have Federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under
the Order. No programmatic or policy changes result from this rule's promulgation which would affect existing relationships
between the Federal Government and State and local governments.



Executive Order 12606, The Family



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is procedural in nature and no significant change in existing
HUD policies or programs impacting on the family result from promulgation of this rule.



Environment



An environmental assessment is unnecessary, since internal administrative procedures whose content does not constitute
a development decision affecting the physical condition of specific project areas or building sites are categorically
excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(k).

 251.2 

GNMA right to assignment.



If the lender-issuer defaults on its obligations under the GNMA Mortgage-Backed Securities Program, GNMA will have
the right to cause all Coinsured Mortgages held in GNMA pools by the defaulting coinsuring lender-issuer to be assigned
to another GNMA-approved coinsuring lender-issuer, or to GNMA itself.

(a) For any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right
to perfect an assignment of the mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have
the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender (unless GNMA determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner,
that the attempt would prove ineffectual because of market conditions or other factors). This attempt will be undertaken
by soliciting offers to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those
eligible coinsuring lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished
to GNMA by the Commissioner.

(b) For any Coinsured Mortgage that is in default and held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to
perfect an assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage directly to itself before extinguishing the Mortgage by completion
of foreclosure action or acquisition of title by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.

(c) GNMA, as assignee, will give the Commissioner written notice, within 30 days after taking a Mortgage by assignment
in accordance with this section, in order to allow an appropriate endorsement and necessary changes in the Commissioner's
records.

(d) The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as provided by this section for full insurance, effective
as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of 24 CFR part 221. Any future claim by GNMA,
or any assignment of the fully insured Mortgage, will be governed by the appropriate provisions of 24 CFR part 221,
except that any payment will be made in cash instead of debentures.

Criteria for Exercising Discretionary Sanctions Under Title I of the Clean Air Act 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rulemaking sets forth criteria that EPA must consider when exercising its discretionary authority to impose
sanctions on a statewide basis pursuant to the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act). If EPA makes one of the findings
of State implementation plan (SIP) deficiency described in the Act, EPA may impose an emissions offset or highway
funding sanction on any portion of the State that the Administrator determines is reasonable and appropriate for
the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of the Act relating to plans are met. This rulemaking establishes the
criteria EPA shall use in exercising its discretionary authority during the 24-month period following a finding
of a plan deficiency to ensure that these sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis when one or more political subdivisions
are principally responsible for such deficiency. In addition, EPA describes the discretionary sanctions provision
and EPA's anticipated application of these sanctions ``at any time'' after the Agency makes a finding. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Overview 



The EPA is promulgating criteria under section 110(m) of the Act to ensure that, during the 24-month period following
a finding, disapproval, or determination (hereinafter ``finding'') referred to in section 179(a), sanctions pursuant
to section 110(m) are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible
for such deficiency. Thus, these criteria apply only in the limited circumstance in which EPA is considering the imposition
of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) within 24 months after the Agency makes a section 179(a) finding.

On September 28, 1992 (57 FR 44534), EPA proposed criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant
to section 110(m) of the Act may not be applied statewide. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion
of the background of the Act, of the proposed criteria, and of the provisions of section 179 and section 110(m) (see
57 FR 44534-44535). 

New  52.30(c) of the rule provides five criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant
to section 110(m) may not be imposed statewide. If at least one political subdivision meets all five of the criteria,
then that political subdivision will be considered principally responsible, and EPA will not impose sanctions on
a statewide basis. Rather, EPA will impose sanctions only on the areas of the State for which EPA determines it is reasonable
and appropriate to impose sanctions. If all of the criteria are not met by at least one political subdivision, then
no political subdivision is principally responsible, and EPA will use its discretion to determine whether to apply
statewide sanctions. However, if EPA, using its discretion, initially determines that less-than-statewide sanctions
should be applied, the Agency will not need to consider the criteria; EPA will impose sanctions on those political
subdivisions the Agency has determined to be reasonable and appropriate. Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case
basis and each action will be subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure
Act.

1

 





In the final rule, EPA has changed four provisions from the proposal based on comments received regarding specific
details of the regulatory text. They are as follows: 

1. In  52.30(a)(2), the definition of ``required activity'' was revised in two ways. First, the phrase ``may
include, but is not limited to'' was deleted from the definition. Second, the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element''
is replaced by the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' These two changes were made in order to follow more clearly the language
of section 110(m). Since section 110(m) refers only to actions required with respect to a ``plan or plan item,'' EPA
agrees that the phrase ``may include, but is not limited to'' is unnecessary because it appears to imply EPA has authority
to impose sanctions with respect to findings other than those for a plan or plan item. Furthermore, since section 110(m)
uses the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' EPA believes it would be more consistent to use that phrase in the regulatory
language rather than the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element.'' 

2. The terms ``plan or plan items'' are added to the definitions section of the rule,  52.30(a)(4), and are defined
as follows: ``For purposes of  52.30, the terms `plan' or `plan item' mean an implementation plan or portion
of an implementation plan or action needed to prepare such plan required by the Act, as amended in 1990, or in response
to a SIP Call under section 110(k)(5) of the amended Act.'' 

3. In  52.30(c), ``criteria,'' as defined in the proposal, provides: ``The EPA will use the following five criteria,
all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.''
This section is clarified by revising it to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this provision, EPA will consider
a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based,
if all five of the following criteria are met.'' Thus, the rule clarifies that all five criteria are to be met, not merely
used by EPA to determine how sanctions will be imposed. 

4. In its proposed rule,  52.30(d)(1), EPA provides: ``If all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section
have been met through the action or inaction of the `same' political subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on
a statewide basis.'' Although no comments were received from the public on this language, a review by the Agency suggested
that the phrase ``same political subdivision'' may be confusing. By including that language in the rule, EPA was attempting
to indicate that one political subdivision must meet all five of the criteria before EPA's authority to impose sanctions
on a statewide basis would be constrained (see 57 FR 44536). For example, if a State has two nonattainment areas and
a rule, which was past due under the Act, was not yet adopted and submitted to EPA for either area, EPA would look at each
nonattainment area independently to determine whether the five criteria were met. If the first three criteria were
met by one nonattainment area and the last two by the second nonattainment area, then EPA's authority to impose statewide
sanctions would not be constrained. However, if one nonattainment area met all five of the criteria, EPA could not
impose statewide sanctions based on the finding for that area. The EPA is replacing the word same with the word one in
the rule in order to alleviate any confusion. This provision will be implemented in accordance with the interpretation
above. 



II. Background 



In general, the preamble to the proposed rule notes that the Act contains two sanctions provisions:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00015 </PARENT>

1. Section 110(m),

2

 provides the Administrator with discretion to impose sanctions at any time on any portion of the State that she determines
is reasonable and appropriate; 




2. Section 179(a)

3

 requires the Administrator to impose sanctions after specific timeframes if the deficiencies on which the sanctions
are based are not corrected.

4

 







This rulemaking considers the application of sanctions under section 110(m). However, because section 110(m) and
section 179 are interrelated, the preamble to the proposed rulemaking discussed sanctions under section 179 (a)
and (b) in order to clarify what is required by section 110(m). 



The specific types of sanctions which may be imposed under section 110(m), or must be imposed under section 179(a),
are listed in section 179(b). The two sanctions provided are a highway funding sanction and a 2:1 offset sanction.
These two sanctions are described in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535). 

Section 179(b) sanctions may be applied pursuant to section 110(m) when the Administrator makes a finding under section
179(a) (1) through (4), provided that the Agency has followed all procedural requirements for imposing a sanction.
The Administrator has no authority under section 110(m), nor any mandatory duty under section 179(a), to impose sanctions
until she has made a finding. The types of findings provided under section 179(a) are discussed in more detail in the
preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535). 

Section 110(m) may be divided into two distinct parts (see 57 FR 44535). The first part of section 110(m) contains four
distinct elements: 

1. The timing of the imposition of section 110(m) sanctions; 

2. The availability under section 110(m) of the sanctions listed in section 179(b); 

3. The reference to a finding, disapproval, or determination under section 179(a) (1) through (4); and 

4. The geographic scope of application of sanctions under section 110(m). 




The second part requires the Administrator to propose criteria to be used when considering the application of sanctions
on a statewide basis under section 110(m) within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. Although not central to the
purpose of this rulemaking, EPA presented a detailed discussion of the four elements referred to in the first part
of section 110(m) in the proposed rule. The purpose was to explain how sections 110(m) and 179 provisions are interrelated.
As shall be evident in the ``Response to Comments'' section, the preamble language discussing these four elements
was the basis for numerous comments. The criteria, which are the basis of this action, seemed to generate significantly
fewer comments. 



III. Development of Criteria 



The second sentence of section 110(m) requires the Agency to establish criteria that EPA must apply if the Agency considers
applying sanctions under section 110(m) on a statewide basis within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. These criteria
should enable EPA to determine when a political subdivision,

5

 rather than the entire State, is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency. Where the political subdivision
is principally responsible, EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. 





The EPA recognizes that an understanding of the term ``principal responsibility'' was integral to the development
of the criteria. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion on how a political subdivision may
be held ``principally responsible'' for a section 179(a) failure when the EPA recognizes that the States have primary
responsibility for meeting the requirements of the Act (see 57 FR 44535-36). The EPA believes that the criteria
promulgated today will clearly indicate when the political subdivision carries the principal burden of carrying
out an activity. 

The EPA is promulgating five criteria (summarized below) that it believes will enable a determination of when a State
has relinquished its primary control over an activity to a political subdivision and the political subdivision has
failed to perform that required activity. The EPA believes that the political subdivision is principally responsible
when the political subdivision: 

1. Has the legal authority to perform the required activity; 

2. Has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform, the required activity; 

3. Has received, where appropriate, adequate funding or authority to obtain funding from the State to perform the
required activity; 

4. Has agreed to perform (and has not revoked that agreement) or is required to accept responsibility for performing
the required activity; and

<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. Has failed to perform the required activity. 

If one or more political subdivisions each meet all five of the criteria, EPA will consider those subdivisions principally
responsible, and EPA may impose sanctions only on those political subdivisions and on other areas (short of the entire
State) for which the Agency determines reasonable and appropriate. The EPA would not impose sanctions statewide.
However, if all of the criteria have not been met by at least one political subdivision, EPA will use its discretion
to determine whether to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 

These five criteria are intended to be applicable to SIP failures relating to stationary, area, and mobile sources.
The EPA believes that the criteria developed here will enable it to successfully determine when a political subdivision
is principally responsible for a deficiency. 



IV. Limits of This Rulemaking 



Nothing in the Act precludes EPA from applying sanctions pursuant to section 110(m), without examining the criteria,
if the Agency elects to impose a sanction on a less-than-statewide basis or where EPA imposes statewide sanctions
more than 24 months after a finding. Furthermore, this rulemaking does not affect the situation where each of a group
of political subdivisions, whose combined area comprises the entire State, suffer a deficiency. The EPA could impose
a sanction on each of those political subdivisions as an independent area without applying the criteria, even though
this may appear to be a statewide sanction. All decisions to impose section 110(m) sanctions will be made on a case-by-case
basis, and will be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. 

This rule is not intended to identify which sanction EPA will apply in a particular circumstance, nor the type of deficiency
for which EPA might use its discretion to apply sanctions. Furthermore, it is not intended to describe the notice and
comment procedures EPA will ultimately use to impose a sanction pursuant to section 110(m). 



V. Response to Comments 



The EPA received comments from 15 sources including business associations, and Federal, State and local government
entities. The following section provides a summary of the responses to major comments. 



A. The EPA's Interpretation of the Statutory Requirements of Section 110(m) 



Under this category, the commenters expressed concern with respect to the timing of sanctions and the application
of sanctions beyond a nonattainment area. Although, as stated before, these issues are not central to the criteria
being promulgated, EPA has responded to these comments below. 



1. Imposition of Sanctions Earlier Than 18 Months 




Comment.

 The Illinois EPA (IEPA) and the Virginia Department of Transportation (DOT) believe section 110(m) does not give
EPA the authority to impose sanctions earlier than 18 months after a finding under section 179. These commenters believe
it is incorrect to impose any sanctions during the 18-month period immediately following a finding because section
179 clearly states that EPA may not impose sanctions if the deficiency is corrected within 18 months. The IEPA believes
Congress included this 18-month period in recognition of the magnitude of the State's responsibilities under the
Act as well as the time involved in the legislative and rulemaking processes. Also, the Illinois DOT states that because
section 179 is the more detailed sanctions provision, under established principles of statutory construction and
interpretation, it must prevail over section 110(m). 

The IEPA suggests that if EPA determined to impose sanctions earlier than the 18-month period specified in section
179, EPA should develop specific criteria for when these early sanctions will be imposed, and provide notice and opportunity
for potentially affected parties to comment prior to imposing sanctions. The IEPA also indicates that these criteria
are necessary to avoid placing industries that are located in States that meet deadlines in a timely manner at a competitive
disadvantage.

<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response.

 Section 110(m) provides that the Administrator ``* * * may apply any of the sanctions listed in section
179(b) (at any time or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding. * * *'' under section 179(a).
This language plainly authorizes sanctions without regard to a waiting period after a finding is made.
The EPA believes that section 179 is phrased to require sanctions after 18 months not, as the commenters say, to prohibit
sanctions before 18 months. Section 179 states ``for any implementation plan or plan revision required under this
part (or required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy as described in section 110(k)(5)), if the Administrator
[makes a finding], unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding * * *
one of the sanctions referred to in subparagraph (b) shall apply. * * *'' This provision mandatorily
imposes sanctions at 18 months if the deficiency has not been corrected, but does not prohibit sanctions earlier.
Because section 179 does not prohibit the earlier application of sanctions, it does not conflict with section 110(m),
which provides that sanctions may be imposed earlier than 18 months. Therefore, there is not a statutory construction
issue of whether section 179 needs to prevail over section 110(m).
Regarding the request by the IEPA that EPA develop specific criteria for when an early sanction will be imposed, the
EPA does not believe such criteria are statutorily required; however, since EPA will provide the public with an opportunity
to comment on any sanction action under section 110(m) through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to imposition
of the sanctions, the public will have the opportunity to comment on EPA's rationale for the application of sanctions
earlier than 18-months following the finding. Although EPA does not intend to develop specific criteria, Section
A(4) of this preamble provides further discussion on application of sanctions earlier than 18-months following
a finding.
As to IEPA's concern about competitive disadvantage, imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) should benefit
sources located in those areas that make timely submittal of plans and plan revisions. Rather than delaying sanctions
until 18 months after a finding, under section 110(m) sanctions may be applied much earlier than 18 months. Therefore,
delinquent areas may be burdened much sooner than the 18-month period under section 179. Imposition of section 110(m)
sanctions should inhibit any advantage achieved through delayed submittal of required plans and revisions.


2. Application of Sanctions Beyond Nonattainment Areas Comment


Five commenters believe highway sanctions should not be imposed outside of a nonattainment area. The Texas DOT, New
York DOT, Illinois DOT and IEPA are concerned that EPA has not extended the nonattainment limitations of section 179
(a) and (b) to the imposition of sanctions under section 110(m). These commenters indicate that sanctions should
apply only to nonattainment areas. The Virginia DOT believes that section 110(m) sanctions should not extend beyond
a nonattainment area, except in extreme cases (such as where lack of good faith exists) and after a 24-month correction
period has passed.
The New York DOT and IEPA believe that EPA's position regarding the geographic applicability of offset and highway
sanctions is inconsistent, and that the reasoning that is applied to make the offset sanction applicable to a specific
area should benefit the highway sanction as well. The IEPA feels that section 110(m) refers to the section 179(b) sanctions
without exempting the Administrator from complying with the geographic limitations specified in section 179(b).
The Illinois DOT comments that section 110(m) allows EPA to sanction an area less than a whole nonattainment area if
a unit of local government is really to blame.
The New York and Illinois DOT also state that since the statute is clear and understandable on its face, no reference
to legislative history is required or allowed. The Illinois DOT believes that section 110(m) should be viewed in conjunction
with section 179(b)(1), and if Congress had not meant to limit the use of highway funding sanctions to nonattainment
areas, it would not have placed that limitation in section 179(b). The Illinois DOT comments that Congressman Anderson
had prefaced his remarks as expressing the intent of only four members of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee. The commenter noted that in May 1990 the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent out a version of the Amendments
with no limit in section 179(b) on the area for sanctions (see H. Rep. No. 140, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Part 1). The House
Public Works Committee responded with a report of its own at that time amending section 110(m) and repeating almost
the same words quoted by EPA in the proposed rulemaking. Congressman Anderson's words may have been on the point then,
but they did not agree with the language of section 179(b) the way it was finally passed by Congress.

Also, the Illinois DOT cites the House Conference Committee Report which accompanied the final version of the Act
as evidence that sanctions are to be limited to nonattainment areas [H. Rep. No. 952, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 335-6;
Cong. Rec. H13101, 13197; Oct. 26, 1990; 1990 U.S. Code Cong. & Adm. News 3385, 3867-8 (Discussing imposition
of sanctions ``* * * in an area that fails to prepare or implement a plan to attain air quality 
standards. * * *'')].


Response.

 To address the concerns of all five commenters, EPA believes that section 110(m) and section 179, although interrelated,
do set up two distinct sanctions processes. In general, section 179 provides for mandatory sanctions with respect
to failures under part D (in general, the nonattainment area provisions). As provided in the proposed rule, section
179 focuses on nonattainment areas in several respects (see 57 FR 44536-37). First, the general introductory
language of section 179(a) provides that sanctions must be imposed for a failure with respect to ``* * *
any implementation plan or plan revision required under this 
part. * * *'' The provision is referring to part D of title I, the portion of the Act dealing with nonattainment
area requirements. While some part D requirements may also apply to attainment areas in limited circumstances, the
primary focus of part D is nonattainment areas. Second, the highway sanction language expressly limits the application
of sanctions under section 179(a) to nonattainment areas. Finally, the offset sanction requires new or modified
sources in complying with the requirements of section 173 to increase their offsets to 2:1. Typically, only sources
in nonattainment areas need to comply with section 173 and, therefore, in most instances the offset sanction will
only affect sources in nonattainment areas. For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 179(a) does not require
statewide imposition of sanctions.
On the other hand, section 110(m) clearly provides for the imposition of sanctions beyond nonattainment areas. The
express language of section 110(m) provides that the Administrator may impose sanctions on ``* * *
any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable and 
appropriate. * * *'' Beyond that, section 110(m) provides for the discretionary imposition of sanctions
for a finding that an area has failed to meet any requirement with respect to any ``plan or plan item'' under the Act.
Such requirements could apply to nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified areas. Although section 110(m) refers
to the sanctions established in section 179(b), there is no language stating that the geographical limitations in
section 179 override section 110(m)'s express authorization for sanctions on any part of the State that EPA determines
reasonable and appropriate. Section 110(m) refers only to the sanctions themselves, not the accompanying limitations.
For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 110(m) does establish its own geographic scope.
The Virginia DOT suggests that EPA should limit application of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment
area to circumstances where there is a lack of good faith. While EPA may take good faith into consideration in determining
the geographic scope of section 110(m) sanctions, EPA does not agree that it should establish lack of good faith as
a prerequisite for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment area.

With respect to the comment of Illinois DOT that EPA can sanction less than an entire nonattainment area, the Agency
agrees that under section 110(m)'s broad grant of authority for the imposition of discretionary sanctions, EPA may
select an area smaller than the nonattainment area.
The IEPA comments that EPA is treating the geographic limitations of the highway and offset sanctions differently
and that EPA should say that highway sanctions are also limited in scope. The EPA disagrees. First, we believe that
both sanctions may be imposed on any portion of the State. However, by its method of application, the offset sanction
will only have effect in those areas that must apply the emission offset requirements of section 173. Therefore, the
offset sanction would have no effect in certain areas. The highway sanction is not self-limiting; therefore, it will
have a broader effect.
Second, the EPA did not rely on legislative history to override statutory language, but rather to support statutory
language that grants EPA discretion to apply sanctions to other than nonattainment areas. The Illinois DOT bases
its argument that the legislative history does not support the imposition of sanctions beyond the nonattainment
area on an assumption that section 110(m) does not provide an independent grant of authority to impose sanctions.
However, the Act does provide two separate grants of sanction authority with different geographic scopes; this is
supported by the language of the Act, as described above, and by the legislative authority. The language from H. Conf.
Rep. No. 101-952 that references the imposition of sanctions on an area that fails to attain the air quality standard
appears to refer to the imposition of sanctions under section 179 because it discusses the required imposition of
sanctions. The language cited by EPA in the preamble to the proposed rule addresses a different grant of statutory
authority to impose sanctions, namely, that authority under section 110(m). In addition, Illinois DOT cites H. Rep.
No. 101-490, which clearly provides that EPA may impose sanctions beyond nonattainment areas by stating that
EPA ``* * * is empowered to apply sanctions to any portion of a State.'' The committee goes on to clarify
how it believes EPA should use this broad grant of authority, indicating that EPA should impose sanctions on the governmental
entity that is ``primarily responsible,'' and noting that a State legislature's failure to adopt an inspection/maintenance
program is a circumstance where statewide sanctions are appropriate.


3. Section 110(m) Does Not Establish Independent Authority to Sanction 



Comment. 

The Virginia DOT believes section 179 is the basis for imposing sanctions and is not superseded by section 110(m).
Furthermore, the Virginia DOT comments that section 110(m) expands on section 179 by requiring that an additional
minimum 6-month grace period must be observed after the initial 18-month period (i.e., 24 months) before sanctions
may be imposed on a statewide basis where a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.
The City of Chicago comments that EPA's proposed imposition of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) as an alternative
to section 179 would vitiate section 179. Once EPA determines none of the political subdivisions meet the criteria,
and thus the entire State is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency, EPA is bound by the requirements
of section 179.


Response.

 The EPA agrees that sanctions cannot be imposed statewide within the first 24 months following a finding where a political
subdivision is found principally responsible for the deficiency. However, EPA disagrees that section 179 provides
the sole authority for imposing sanctions and, in doing so, allows for the imposition of statewide sanctions. As discussed
in the response to Comment 2 above, section 179 does not refer to the imposition of statewide sanctions and, in fact,
focuses on the imposition of sanctions in nonattainment areas. In fact, the EPA believes the reference to statewide
sanctions under section 110(m) makes it clear that section 110(m) establishes a different authority to sanction
States and that statewide sanctions are not required under section 179. Section 110(m) provides that statewide sanctions
shall not be applied within 24 months of the time a finding is made if a political subdivision is principally responsible
for the deficiency; this provision means that statewide sanctions may be imposed earlier than 24 months if no political
subdivision is found principally responsible. If section 179 required statewide sanctions after 18 months, it would
be contrary to the section 110(m) provision that sanctions shall not apply within the 24 months following the finding
if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. Therefore, EPA believes that its ability
to impose statewide sanctions during the 24-month period following a finding is based on a determination under section
110(m) that a political subdivision is not principally responsible for the deficiency.

Section 110(m) does not vitiate section 179 because section 179 sanctions are not statewide but are imposed on the
specific area for which the deficiency arises, in most instances nonattainment areas. As stated previously, section
179 mandates that sanctions be imposed 18 months after a finding is made. While the imposition of sanctions earlier
under section 110(m) could remove the need to impose sanctions under section 179 sanctions in that area, section 179
has continued force and effect in areas where section 110(m) sanctions are not imposed. The EPA does not believe that
imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) conflicts with section 179 sanctions. Application of sanctions earlier
than 18 months is not inconsistent because EPA believes the purpose of section 179 was to ensure that EPA did not delay
sanctions beyond the periods prescribed in that action.


4. Regulatory Limitation on Early Imposition of Sanctions




Comment.

 The United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) recommends adding a statement to the rule that EPA expects
to impose sanctions on a statewide basis earlier than 18 months only in limited circumstances, after notice-and-comment
rulemaking.


Response.

 This statement was not in the proposed rule and EPA believes it should not be included in the final rule. The EPA stated
in the preamble to the proposed rule that it would only apply sanctions early in ``unusual circumstances where the
State has indicated explicit resistance to working to resolve a plan deficiency'' (see 57 FR 44534). The final rule
revises this preamble language because EPA believes the term ``unusual circumstances'' provides little guidance
as to when EPA intended to use its discretionary sanction authority.
While EPA does not intend to use the section 110(m) authority in all situations where a finding is made, the Agency needs
to ascertain that it has the flexibility to use this option when necessary. In order to develop some plans or plan items,
States must perform certain steps that EPA can track to determine whether the State will meet deadlines in the Act.
When a State believes that EPA can impose sanctions only after a deadline is missed and 18 months have gone by, then there
is little incentive for the State to take the necessary actions to complete authorization and implementation of politically-difficult
rules and regulations. The EPA needs to maintain its flexibility to respond rapidly to situations where it appears
a State will not meet a deadline, and to assure the State that it does not, in fact, have an extended grace period for noncompliance.
The certainty and swiftness of imposition of the Act's penalties are critical to timely completion of the SIP's. Consequently,
the revised language, clarifies EPA's position concerning when discretionary sanctions may be appropriate while
retaining EPA's flexibility to use such sanctions to ensure compliance with the Act. Thus, EPA will exercise section
110(m) sanctions earlier than 18 months only in cases where:
1. The State has indicated an explicit resistance to resolving a plan or program deficiency or to making a required
plan or program submittal; or
2. Where special circumstances, particular program needs, or time constraints dictate the need for use of such sanctions.
Thus, the rule retains the Administrator's discretion to apply sanctions at any time after a finding is made; however,
EPA will provide notice and opportunity for comment on the basis for all section 110(m) actions.

B. EPA Discretion to Determine the ``Reasonable and Appropriate'' Area for Imposition of Sanctions 



1. 

Comment.

 The City of Chicago believes the discretion in  52.30(d)_that if the criteria are met EPA may impose sanctions
on a less than statewide basis to the area it determines is reasonable and appropriate_was not Congress' intent in
enacting section 110(m). The City of Chicago believes EPA's only discretion is whether to apply sanctions to political
subdivisions that meet the criteria. Thus, the City of Chicago believes EPA has no basis to apply sanctions when the
criteria are not met (i.e., to apply sanctions to political subdivisions that were thought to be principally responsible,
but did not meet the criteria, and to any other surrounding political subdivisions EPA determines is reasonable and
appropriate) and that to apply sanctions to these areas is arbitrary and capricious. 



Response.

 Section 110(m) states that sanctions may be applied to any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable
and appropriate, with one exception. If one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible for the deficiency,
sanctions may not be applied statewide. Therefore, if the criteria are met, i.e., a political subdivision is principally
responsible, then EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. However, if no political subdivision is principally
responsible, the text of section 110(m) expressly authorizes EPA to move forward and impose sanctions on a statewide
basis. The EPA would make a determination, however, concerning what area of the State for which sanctions would be
reasonable and appropriate. Furthermore, EPA is not required to establish criteria to determine the area of the State
for which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions under section 110(m). 

2. 

Comment.

 Four commenters, New York DOT, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), the City of Chicago, and the U.S.
DOT, requested clarification of how EPA will determine the ``reasonable and appropriate'' area to apply sanctions.
The City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT assert that the statute requires such clarification. The New York DOT believes
that the lack of adequate guidance on what area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' will create confusion and continual
uncertainty on the part of States as well as Federal agencies. The New York DOT suggests that the prime consideration
should be whether a good faith effort has been made to bring the nonattainment area into compliance. The New York DOT
believes that if this issue is not addressed in this rulemaking, it should be the subject of another rulemaking. 

The OCTA cites the example of California, which consists of several regional authorities, which, in turn, each consist
of several local jurisdictions. The OCTA is concerned about how EPA would impose sanctions in the case where a regional
authority contains several local jurisdictions and where a local authority failed to do everything mandated by a
regional plan. The commenter believes it would be more reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions to the single
local jurisdiction, not the regional authority. In addition to assuring that the State does not suffer sanctions
if one political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency, the commenter suggests that EPA assure
that regions within a State would not be subject to sanctions if one or more local jurisdictions is/are principally
responsible for the deficiency. 

The U.S. DOT comments that in situations where a nonattainment area contains multiple political subdivisions, none
of which are principally responsible according to the five criteria, the rule must clarify how EPA will determine
whether to apply sanctions to the specific responsible political subdivision(s) rather than the entire nonattainment
area. 

The City of Chicago and U.S. DOT assert that the statutory mandate to promulgate criteria is not limited to the determination
of principal responsibility. These commenters argue that EPA must also develop criteria to determine when the imposition
of sanctions would be reasonable and appropriate, and the criteria should be sufficient to put potentially affected
political subdivisions on notice of the activities or agreements which may put them at risk of sanctions.

Response.

 Section 110(m) specifically provides that EPA may impose sanctions on any part of the State that EPA deems is reasonable
and appropriate. Section 110(m) then requires that EPA ``* * * establish criteria for exercising
(this) authority * * * to ensure that * * * such sanctions are not applied on a statewide
basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible
for such deficiency.'' The EPA believes this language strictly limits the required development of criteria to those
necessary to determine if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. There is no requirement
that the criteria must guide EPA's further decision of which area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' for the imposition
of sanctions. At this time, EPA does not have experience with imposing these sanctions and, therefore, does not want
to constrain the Agency in the exercise of this discretion. The variety of circumstances would make it difficult to
develop criteria that would be applicable in every instance. As to the comments of the City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT
that EPA needs to establish criteria for when it will impose sanctions under section 110(m), EPA does not believe that
such criteria are mandated. The public will have an opportunity to comment on EPA's determination of the area on which
it will impose sanctions and the timing of sanctions during each specific section 110(m) rulemaking action. 



C. Selection and Design of Criteria 



Under this category, the commenters focused their particular concerns on the sanction criteria. 

1. 

Comment.

 The OCTA suggests that the rule clarify that all five criteria are to be met, not merely used, by EPA to determine if a
subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. The OCTA suggests the following language: ``Criteria.
The EPA will use the following five criteria, all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision
is principally responsible for the deficiency.'' 



Response.

 The EPA agrees with this comment but determined that language other than that suggested would be clearer. Therefore,
EPA has revised  52.30(d)(1) to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this action, EPA will consider a political
subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five
of the following criteria are met.'' 

2. 

Comment.

 The New York DOT comments that the necessity for all five criteria to be met is overly strict and biased toward imposition
of sanctions statewide, and it may be difficult to establish that all five have been met. Therefore, the New York DOT
suggests that only a majority (three out of five) be met. 



Response.

 The EPA believes all five criteria are needed to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible.
The EPA sees no compelling reason to weaken this requirement. In addition, the failure to determine that one or more
areas are principally responsible does not presuppose the imposition of statewide sanctions; the EPA must determine
that the area sanctioned is the reasonable and appropriate area. 

3. 

Comment.

 The U.S. DOT requests clarification of what State actions are necessary to provide adequate legal authority under
the proposed Criterion 1. Criterion 1 states that the State must provide adequate legal authority to a political subdivision
to perform the required activity. 



Response.

 The EPA does not believe that there is a single distinct definition of the term ``legal authority.'' What constitutes
adequate legal authority may vary from State to State. This should be handled on a case-by-case basis. 

4. 

Comment. 

The New York DOT comments that under the proposed Criterion 2 [ 52.30(c)(2)], there must be a very clear agreement
in the SIP or some other document as to which functions are to be performed by which agencies. For example, functions
traditionally performed by local agencies may not be performed that way under the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response.

 The EPA agrees with the commenter and encourages States to develop clear agreements as to which functions are being
performed by which agencies. Note in particular that section 174 of the Act requires States to jointly review and update,
as necessary, their planning procedures that were in effect before the Act was amended in 1990 or to develop new procedures
as appropriate. In preparing such procedures, State and local elected officials must determine which elements of
a revised SIP will be developed, adopted, and implemented by the State, and which elements will be carried out by local
or regional entities. The EPA has provided guidance on this and other section 174 requirements in a document entitled
``1992 Transportation and Air Quality Planning Guidelines'' (July 1992, EPA 420/R-92-001). The EPA
will work with the State and the political subdivision to ascertain if this criterion has been met. In addition, any
comments raised as to this issue during the rulemaking process on a specific section 110(m) action will be properly
considered by EPA. 

5.

 Comment.

 Concerning Criterion 4 [ 52.30(c)(4)], the U.S. DOT also comments there should be a provision included to provide
against ``State failure.'' If a local agency cancels an agreement to perform a certain function, it might leave the
State without the time or resources to perform the function. Thus, the State, instead of the local agency, would become
principally responsible. The U.S. DOT believes it would be inappropriate to apply statewide sanctions in such a case.




Response.

 If the local agency cancels its agreement to perform a function, EPA would take this into consideration when determining
whether the political subdivision is principally responsible in causing the deficiency. Moreover, this factor
may be considered in determining the area to which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions. The EPA can
consider all factors in determining what area is reasonable and appropriate. 

6.

 Comment.

 The Massachusetts DOT believes the rule should contain a specific provision for State consultation in determining
principal responsibility because many factors such as regional demographic trends, changing local traffic patterns,
and land-use decisions in adjoining areas have a larger impact on emissions than institutional arrangements for
air quality planning. The proposed criteria may be the best way to evaluate whether the State or the political subdivision
is solely responsible for the emissions requirements, but it may not be relevant in targeting the actual source of
the problem or in defining solutions. 



Response.

 To the extent it determines appropriate, EPA will consult with the State when evaluating the criteria under section
110(m). In any event, the State will have adequate opportunity to raise any such concerns in the comment period following
the notice of proposed rulemaking for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions. 



D. Other Relevant Comments 



1.

 Comment.

 The State of Vermont comments that it is the only State in attainment with the ozone national ambient air quality standards
and also located within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. Vermont requests clarification in the rule of whether
attainment status or inclusion in the ozone transport region (OTR) is the deciding factor with respect to applicability
of these rules. 



Response.

 Neither attainment status nor inclusion in the OTR is the deciding factor. Under section 110(m), EPA may impose sanctions
on a statewide basis or on any area of the State deemed reasonable and appropriate based on the failure of the State or
a political subdivision of the State to meet a requirement of the Act with respect to a plan or plan element. If a requirement
is applicable to a political subdivision of the State, EPA will determine whether that political subdivision was
principally responsible for the failure, using the criteria established in this rulemaking. The EPA's ability to
use the section 110(m) sanctions is not limited to nonattainment areas or areas that must meet the title I, part D nonattainment
requirements. 

2.

 Comment.

 The City of Chicago comments that the term ``required activity'' contravenes the definition of required activity
in section 179 and permits EPA to sanction entities without providing any prior notice that EPA considers a particular
action to be sanctionable. The City of Chicago also comments that since section 110(m) incorporates section 179(a),
EPA is not permitted to create a second, conflicting definition. Furthermore, the proposed definition does not identify
covered activities, and it does not give entities prior notice of sanctionable activities. Finally, the City of Chicago
is concerned about the ambiguity of the definition and that it may mean EPA is expanding the definition from section
179(a).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response.

 Section 179(a) does not define required activity. Rather, EPA believes this introductory phrase under section 179(a)
refers to submittals required under part D of the Act. The four general categories of activities listed in section
179(a) are the four possible types of State failure with respect to the required activities under part D. The types
of failure are not synonymous with required activities under the introductory language of section 179(a). Finally,
the City of Chicago contends that the definition of ``required activity'' is too open-ended because of the language
``may include, but is not limited to.'' 

The EPA interprets the term ``required activity'' for purposes of section 110(m) in a manner similar to that for section
179(a); however, EPA recognizes that for section 110(m), ``required activity'' refers to any plan or plan item requirement
under the Act, not just those required under part D. Finally, EPA agrees that the language ``may include, but is not
limited to'' may provide broader authority than that granted under section 110(m). Therefore, EPA has changed the
definition in the final rule to provide: ``The term `required activity' refers to the submission of a plan or plan item
or the implementation of a plan or plan item under the Clean Air Act.'' 

3.

 Comment.

 The OCTA and the U.S. DOT request clarification of the term ``political subdivision.'' Both commenters appear concerned
about whether EPA in making a determination of ``principal responsibility'' may consider less than the entire nonattainment
area. The OCTA notes that California has several regional authorities that each are composed of numerous local jurisdictions.
These local jurisdictions often have the responsibility for ``adopting and implementing air pollution controls.''




Response.

 The definition of ``political subdivision'' set forth in  52.30(a)(1) includes all types of governmental
entities, including local jurisdictions. The EPA could sanction less than an entire nonattainment area based on
a determination that a local jurisdiction was principally responsible for the deficiency on which the sanction is
based. 

4.

 Comment.

 The OCTA comments that the proposed rule should include a definition of ``plan item.'' The OCTA notes that section
110(m) reads in part ``* * * in relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by the
Administrator). * * *'' The OCTA cites the example of the California SIP, which is partially composed
of regional plans. Some regional plans require local jurisdictions to take certain actions, which to the commenter
appear to be plan items. 



Response.

 As discussed earlier, to make this clearer, EPA replaces the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' under  52.30(a)(2)
with the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' Although EPA interpreted the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' to essentially
mean the same as the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' this replacement is more consistent with the language of section
110(m) which refers to ``plan or plan item.'' ``Plan and plan item'' are also defined under  52.30(a)(4). 



E. Comments on Policy Stated In Preamble to Proposed Rule 



1. Choice of Sanctions 





Comment.

 The Texas DOT, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission
(NIRPC) asked EPA to identify which sanction will be applied for various types of SIP deficiencies. These commenters
all state that the sanction should be tied to the underlying deficiency. For example, the commenters state that highway
sanctions should only be applied when there is a SIP deficiency relative to mobile sources and the offset sanction
where the deficiency is relative to stationary sources. The CMA recommends adding extra language to the rule as follows:
``The EPA will assess the nature of the deficiencies and take this into account when determining which sanction to
apply.'' 

The NIRPC further asserts that only those projects which have the potential for increasing emissions should be targeted;
withholding highway funds which may correct a problem is inappropriate. 



Response.

 The type of sanction to be applied and the selection procedure are not part of this rulemaking. Sanction determinations
will be made on a case-by-case basis. The EPA will go through notice-and-comment rulemaking on selection and imposition
of sanctions under section 110(m). The notice will propose for comment which sanctions or sanction will be applied.
In addition, the Act sets forth those projects exempted from the highway funding restrictions. The EPA will act consistently
with the requirements of the Act in imposing the highway funding restrictions. 



2. Impact of Rule on Title 23 Funds 





Comment.

 The American Public Transit Association is concerned about how EPA's sanction determination process could affect
the process and procedures of transferring flexible funds (i.e., certain title 23 program funds) from highway to
transit purposes. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority requests clarification of how any imposed
restrictions on highway funds would affect funds previously flexed to transit as provided for in the ISTEA.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response. 

This rulemaking is not intended to address how the highway sanctions will be implemented. The EPA is in the process
of developing procedures with the U.S. DOT to provide for the coordinated implementation of the highway sanction.
The EPA and the U.S. DOT will develop procedures consistent with the specifications in section 179(b). 


3. Authority to Sanction For Failure to Implement 




Comment. 

The Massachusetts DOT comments that EPA's authority to sanction a State if ``* * * a requirement of
an approved plan is not being implemented is too broad, given the large number of agencies, regulatory authorities,
and group interests which can prevent a planned project from being implemented.'' Instead, a State's good faith effort
to implement an approved project should be identified as an exception to this policy. 


Response. 

The types of findings that may lead to the imposition of sanctions are specified in the Act; they are not being developed
by this rulemaking. Therefore, once a finding of failure to implement a plan has been made, section 179(a) requires
that the 18-month mandatory sanctions clock begins. Furthermore, any finding made under section 179(a) provides
EPA with discretion to impose sanctions under section 110(m). 


4. Clarification of Offset Sanction 




Comment. 

The Massachusetts DOT requests clarification of the requirement for a 2:1 emissions reduction from existing sources
to offset emissions from major new facilities. The Massachusetts DOT believes it is not reasonable to require reductions
from existing, older or congested facilities before major new improvements are made. 


Response. 

The procedure by which facilities offset emissions is not the subject of this rulemaking. Those issues must be resolved
in regulations adopted by the State pursuant to the requirements of section 173. 


VI. Miscellaneous 


A. Relationship to Permit Program 


The Act includes specific sanctions provisions for permitting requirements in section 502(d) and (i), 42 U.S.C.,
7661a(d) and (i). The section 110(m) sanctions procedure does not apply with respect to findings regarding permit
program failures. 


B. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that this action is a ``significant regulatory
action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. 


C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C 605(b), the Administrator hereby certifies that the attached rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since the rule requires EPA to consider criteria
before applying sanctions on a statewide basis, it potentially could result in a reduced burden on small entities.



D. Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to review by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501,

Criteria for limiting application of sanctions under section 110(m) of the Clean Air Act on a statewide basis.


(a) 

Definitions. 

For the purpose of this section:
(1) The term ``political subdivision'' refers to the representative body that is responsible for adopting and/or
implementing air pollution controls for one, or any combination of one or more of the following: city, town, borough,
county, parish, district, or any other geographical subdivision created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law.
This will include any agency designated under section 174, 42 U.S.C. 7504, by the State to carry out the air planning
responsibilities under part D.
(2) The term ``required activity'' means the submission of a plan or plan item, or the implementation of a plan or plan

section.
(4) For purposes of  52.30, the terms ``plan'' or ``plan item'' mean an implementation plan or portion of an implementation
plan or action needed to prepare such plan required by the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, or in response to a SIP call
issued pursuant to section 110(k)(5) of the Act. 
(b) 

Sanctions. 

During the 24 months after a finding, determination, or disapproval under section 179(a) of the Clean Air Act is made,
EPA will not impose sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act on a statewide basis if the Administrator finds that one
or more political subdivisions of the State are principally responsible for the deficiency on which the finding,
disapproval, or determination as provided under section 179(a)(1) through (4) is based.

(1) The State has provided adequate legal authority to a political subdivision to perform the required activity.
(2) The required activity is one which has traditionally been performed by the local political subdivision, or the
responsibility for performing the required activity has been delegated to the political subdivision.
(3) The State has provided adequate funding or authority to obtain funding (when funding is necessary to carry out
the required activity) to the political subdivision to perform the required activity.
(4) The political subdivision has agreed to perform (and has not revoked that agreement), or is required by State law
to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity.
(5) The political subdivision has failed to perform the required activity.
(d) 

Imposition of sanctions. 

(1) If all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section have been met through the action or inaction of one political

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Programs for the States of North Dakota and Utah



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rulemaking.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 25, 1993 EPA published the notices of proposed rulemaking to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM) in each State. The implementation
plans were submitted by the States to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to
ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply
with the CAA. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposals. No comments were received pursuant to these
proposed actions. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revisions to the North Dakota and Utah SIPs
for establishing a PROGRAM in each State.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background of Revisions 


Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
The States of North Dakota and Utah submitted SIP revisions to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507
of the CAA. In order to gain full approval, the State's submittals must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements:




(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses required by section 507(a); 
(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process which is required by section 507(a)(3); and
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP
required by section 507(e). 


II. Summary of Submittals


The State of North Dakota has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements
all required PROGRAM elements. N.D.C.C. sections 23-25-02 and 23-25-03 grants the Department
the authority to undertake the elements of the PROGRAM. The Governor, through Executive Order 1992-5, established
the Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel. The North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories
(the Department) formally adopted the SIP revision on October 23, 1992, which identifies a plan to implement the PROGRAM.
This SIP revision is being added to the North Dakota SIP as section 12. The North Dakota PROGRAM was submitted to EPA
by the Governor of North Dakota on November 2, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness.
In a letter dated December 15, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive
determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January 18, 1993, EPA notified the
State in a letter dated February 2, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. The submittal
then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers. 
The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its SIP revision section 12.5 to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State has met the second PROGRAM element
by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office of the Chief of the Environmental Health Section
effective April 6, 1992, as stated in its SIP revision section 12.3. The State has met the third PROGRAM element through
Executive Order 1992-5 dated May 21, 1992, issued by the Governor of North Dakota, which established a Small
Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of North Dakota, and by outlining in its SIP revision section 12.4
the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally,
the State of North Dakota has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. This mechanism is contained in section 12.2 of the State's SIP revision.
The State of Utah has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required
PROGRAM elements. Section 19-2-109.2 of the Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended authorizes the Utah
Air Quality Board to establish a SBAP, and create a Compliance Advisory Panel. A new section 17, which is a plan for implementation
of the SBAP, will be added to the Utah SIP. R307-2 of the Utah Air Conservation Rules incorporates this SIP revision
by reference. The Utah PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Utah on November 9, 1992, with supplemental information
sent on November 5, 1992, and January 11, 1993. EPA notified the State in a letter dated December 30, 1992, that the submittal
was administratively and technically complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received
a concurrence from all reviewers. 
The State of Utah has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in section 17.3 of its regulations to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) of the CAA for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State of Utah has met the second
PROGRAM element by locating the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of the Executive Director, as stated in section 17.5.1 of its regulations. The State of Utah has met the third
PROGRAM element by outlining in sections 17.4.1 and 2 of its regulations the functions of the CAP and how the members
will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e) of the CAA. Additionally, the State of Utah has established
a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation
of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. This mechanism is contained in section
17.2 of the State's regulations.


III. Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah. The revisions were made to satisfy
the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
By this action, EPA is approving two State programs created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. These programs do not impose any new regulatory burdens on
small businesses; they are programs under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided
by the States. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

Special Rules Applicable to Surface Coal Mining Hearings and Appeals




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Hearings and Appeals, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) amends several existing rules that govern procedures for hearings and appeals
under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 in order to bring the rules up to date. Because of events
that have occurred since they were adopted, the existing rules omit references or contain incorrect references,
are inconsistent with other rules, or fail to provide necessary information or procedures. The amendments correct
these defects. In this document OHA also updates telephone numbers of offices of field solicitors and field offices
of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), listed in the existing rules, to reflect changes
which have been effected heretofore.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 19, 1991, OHA proposed amendments to existing procedural rules governing hearings and appeals under
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201 

et seq.

 (1988), because rules subsequently adopted or cases decided have rendered the existing rules out of date or shown
them to be incomplete or inaccurate. See 56 FR 58330-58332 (Nov. 19, 1991). No comments were received on the published
proposed amendments. The amendments effected by this final rulemaking are explained below under the heading for
each rule involved.




Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1100



As a result of previous amendments of 43 CFR 4.1109(a) to provide current addresses and jurisdictions of field solicitors
who are to be served documents (see 56 FR 2139, 2142-43 (Jan. 22, 1991), 56 FR 5061 (Feb. 7, 1991)), the definition
of ``field solicitor'' in 43 CFR 4.1100(d) is superfluous. It was proposed to remove that definition and redesignate
the following definitions in alphabetical order. No comments were received on this proposal. That definition is
therefore removed and the following definitions (e) and (f) are redesignated (d) and (e).



Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1105(a)



30 CFR 842.15(d) provides a right of appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) under 43 CFR 4.1280


et seq.

 of the written determination, after informal review by the Director of the OSM or his or her designee, concerning the
decision of an authorized representative of the Secretary not to inspect or take enforcement action concerning an
alleged violation that is the subject of a request for a federal inspection under 30 CFR 842.12.

Similarly, 30 CFR 843.12(i) provides that any determination by an authorized representative of the Secretary granting
or denying an abatement period exceeding 90 days under 30 CFR 842.12(h) shall contain a right of appeal to IBLA under
1280 

et seq.

<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00063 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As the Board has had occasion to observe, however, 43 CFR 4.1105 does not name the permittee of the operation that is
the subject of a determination of the Director or an authorized representative, or any person whose interests might
be adversely affected by the outcome on appeal and who participated before OSM, as a party who must be served with a copy
of the notice of appeal and statement of reasons under 43 CFR 4.1283(a) and who may participate under   4.1284
and 4.1286. See Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc., 108 IBLA 70, 83 n.7, 96 I.D. 139, 146 n.7 (1989). OHA therefore
proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1105(a) by adding subsection (5) naming such permittees and persons as parties.

After this addition to 43 CFR 4.1105(a) was proposed, however, the Board decided Robert L. Clewell, 123 IBLA 253 (1992).
In that case, citizens who had requested their identity be kept confidential, in accordance with 30 CFR 842.12(b),
later revealed their identity to the coal company whose operation they had requested be inspected by sending a copy
of their statement of reasons of appealing the denial of their request for inspection to the company. Had they not done
so, under the terms of  842.12(b), their ``identity may not be revealed, even to other parties to a case, unless
and until a competent official acting in response to a formal request filed under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) or other Federal
law has determined that [their] identity must be made public because it does not fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)
(1988) or any other exemption from disclosure provided by law. See 42 FR 62665-66 (Dec. 13, 1977).'' Robert L.
Clewell, 

supra

 at 257 n.1.

As a result of this decision, OHA has added a statement to the new  4.1105(a)(5) that a person who wishes his or
her identity kept confidential under 30 CFR 842.12(b) is responsible for maintaining that confidentiality when
serving documents in accordance with  4.1109.



Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1109(a)



43 CFR 4.1109(a) is amended to update field solicitor office telephone number to reflect changes which have been effected
heretofore.



Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1151(b)



OSM amended 30 CFR 723.19(a) and 845.19(a) to provide 30 days rather than 15 days in which a person may file a petition
for review of a proposed civil penalty with the Hearings Division of OHA after the date of service of notice of an assessment
conference officer's action. See 56 FR 10060, 10063 (Mar. 8, 1991). OHA therefore proposed to amend the corresponding
procedural rule, 43 CFR 4.1151(b), to provide the same time and to add a reference to 30 CFR 845.18. No comments were
received on the proposed change, so it is adopted.



Amendments of 43 CFR 4.1152, 4.1154, and 4.1157



The references to 30 CFR part 723 in 43 CFR 4.1152(a)(2); to 30 CFR 723.15 in 43 CFR 4.1154(a); and to 30 CFR 723.12 and
723.13 in 43 CFR 4.1157 (a) and (b) need to be updated by correcting the references in 43 CFR 4.1154(a) and in 43 CFR 4.1157
(a) and (b) and by adding references to the corresponding sections in 30 CFR part 845. OHA proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1152,
4.1154, and 4.1157 for this purpose. No comments on these proposed changes were received, so they are adopted.



Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1266(b)(2) 



43 CFR 4.1266(b)(2) is amended to update OSM field office telephone numbers to reflect changes which have been effected
heretofore. 



Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1271(a)



When 43 CFR part 4, subpart L was originally promulgated in 1978, 43 CFR 4.1271(a) provided that an aggrieved party
could file a ``notice of appeal'' from an order or decision of an administrative law judge disposing of a proceeding
``under this subpart, except a civil penalty proceeding under  4.1150.'' This is still the language of the rule.
Since 1978, however, other rules have been added to subpart L that provide for a ``petition for discretionary review,''
rather than a notice of appeal, as the document to file with IBLA when seeking review of the initial decision of an administrative
law judge. See 43 CFR 4.1309, 4.1369 (56 FR 2139, 2144, Jan. 22, 1991; 56 FR 5061, Feb. 7, 1991). OHA has also proposed
rules that provide for petitions for discretionary review. See 43 CFR 4.1377, 4.1387 (56 FR 45806, Sept. 6, 1991).
Further, special procedures for seeking IBLA review exist for other proceedings in subpart L. See 43 CFR 4.1187, 4.1196,
4.1391.

Although it is possible for IBLA to clarify by decision which avenue of appeal is appropriate for each proceeding,
see 

The Hopi Tribe 

v. 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation & Enforcement

, 107 IBLA 329 (1989), it is preferable for the procedural rules themselves to contain this information. OHA therefore
proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1271(a) so that the rule will specify for which proceedings a notice of appeal is appropriate.
No comments on the proposed change were received, so it is adopted. Proceedings not covered by the procedural rules
set forth in the revised  4.1271(a) contain special provisions for seeking review of initial decisions.

Determination of Effects



The Department has determined that these rules will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number
of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). These rules were not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866.



National Environmental Policy Act



The Department has determined that these rules will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment
on the basis of the categorical exclusion of regulations of a procedural nature set forth in 516 DM 2, Appendix 1, section
1.10.



Paperwork Reduction Act



These rules contain no information collection requirements requiring Office of Management and Budget approval
under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. 



Takings Implication Assessment



These rules do not pose any takings implications requiring preparation of a Takings Implication Assessment under
Executive Order No. 12630 of March 18, 1988.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final amended trade regulation rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Trade Commission issues final amendments to the Funeral Industry Practices Trade Regulation Rule (hereafter
``the Rule'' or ``the original Rule''), pursuant to the review mandated by  453.10 of the Rule. That provision
required that the Commission initiate a rulemaking amendment proceeding no later than four years after the effective
date of the Rule to determine whether the rule should be amended or terminated. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The amended Rule retains the Rule's primary itemization, price and other disclosure requirements, without major,
substantive modification; expressly prohibits non-declinable fees (such as so-called ``casket handling fees''
or ``basic facilities fees'') charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director
and staff; deletes the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement, but retains the obligation to give price and
other information to consumers who request it over the telephone; and contains a series of changes to the original
Rule in the nature of fine-tuning and technical revisions designed to make the Rule more effective and to facilitate
compliance.

STATEMENT OF BASIS AND PURPOSE 
I. Introduction 


A. Overview of the Original Rule 


The Commission promulgated the original Rule on September 24, 1982, making it fully effective on April 30, 1984.

2

 The Commission's decision to promulgate the Rule was appealed, and was subsequently affirmed in Harry & Bryant
Co. v.

 FTC.

3

 The Funeral Rule declares it an unfair or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to: (1) fail to furnish price
information to funeral consumers; (2) require consumers to purchase items they do not desire to buy; and (3) embalm
deceased human remains for a fee without authorization. The Rule further declares it a deceptive practice for funeral
providers to misrepresent: (1) the necessity for embalming, caskets for cremation, and grave vaults or grave liners;
(2) legal and cemetery requirements; (3) preservation and protection capabilities of funeral goods and services;
and (4) cash advance charges for items arranged for by the funeral provider on the consumer's behalf.






To prevent those practices and to correct consumers' misimpressions, the Rule contains several remedial requirements.
The Rule requires that funeral providers: (1) Disclose written price information by means of a General Price List
(``GPL''), Casket Price List (``CPL''), and an outer burial container price list (``OBC-PL'') to persons who
inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services 
(  453.2(b)(2)-(4));

4

 (2) Give purchasers a written statement, after they have selected funeral goods and services, containing the prices
for each of the items selected, the total price for the funeral arrangements selected, price estimates or actual costs,
if known, for cash advance items, and any legal, cemetery or crematory requirements that compel the purchase of any
items or services for the particular funeral ( 453.2(b)(5)); 




(3) Affirmatively disclose to telephone callers who inquire about funeral ``terms, prices or conditions'' that
price information is available over the telephone ( 453.2(b)(1)(i));
(4) Disclose specific price information over the telephone to persons who call and request it ( 453.2(b)(1)(ii));
(5) Make truthful representations about legal and other requirements that compel the purchase of particular items
or services ( 453.3)); 
(6) Allow consumers to select and purchase only those goods and services they desire (rather than offering goods and
services only in predetermined packages) ( 453.4(b));
(7) Seek express approval before embalming the deceased for a fee ( 453.5)); 
(8) Make truthful representations about the preservative and protective value of funeral goods and services ( 453.3(e));

(9) Disclose that they charge a fee for obtaining cash advance items, if that is the case ( 453.3(f)); and
(10) Make unfinished wood boxes or alternative containers available for direct cremation, if the provider offers
direct cremation 
( 453.4(a)(2)).

The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose stated that the essential purpose of the Rule is to lower barriers
to price competition in the funeral market and facilitate informed consumer choice.

5

 The Rule thus seeks to ensure that consumers have access to sufficient information to permit informed purchase decisions,
that consumers are not required to purchase items they do not want and are not required by law to purchase, and that misrepresentations
are not used to influence consumer purchase decisions.

6

 






The staff on July 9, 1985 issued Final Compliance Guidelines to assist providers in their efforts to comply with the
Rule.

7

 Following an initial period where the Commission sought principally through educational efforts to encourage industry
compliance, the Commission to date has obtained thirty-six consent orders and one litigated order in thirty-seven
completed federal district court actions filed against individual providers regarding various violations of the
Rule.

8

 






B. The Amended Rule 



The Commission, in promulgating the amended Rule, seeks to increase the Rule's potential benefits to consumers by
clarifying its requirements and reducing actual or potential compliance burdens on the funeral industry. Such action
should increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosure and other obligations.
Based on the record in this proceeding, the Commission has concluded that the low levels of industry compliance with,
and consumer awareness of, the Rule do not permit a full cost-benefit analysis of its impact, because the analysis
does not capture the full effects of the Rule had there been greater compliance. Despite this finding, the Commission
has determined from the record evidence that the Rule is providing pro-competitive and informational benefits to
consumers that outweigh its costs to providers, and that those benefits, but not costs, are likely to increase over
time as Rule compliance and consumer awareness of their rights under the Rule increase. The Commission has further
concluded that the record in this proceeding does not contain a sufficient basis to overturn the Rule's presumptive
validity as a legally promulgated rule.

The Commission has concluded, however, that clarifying amendments to the price disclosure and ``unbundling'' provisions
of the Rule are necessary to clarify that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice to impose non-declinable fees
in addition to the one for ``basic services of funeral director and staff,'' permitted under  453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).
These amendments effectively eliminate the imposition of so-called ``casket handling fees'' as separate non-declinable
fees charged to consumers who purchase caskets from non-funeral home sources.

9

 The Commission has determined that these fees serve to frustrate the Rule's basic ``unbundling'' requirement by
penalizing consumers who decline caskets sold by the funeral home and instead purchase them from third party sellers.
The emergence of third-party casket sellers, and consequently, those fees, have developed in the market since the
Rule's promulgation. 






The Commission further has concluded that repeal of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement ( 453.2(b)(1)(i))
is warranted because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits. The record evidence indicates that the
affirmative telephone disclosure is an inartful and unnecessary signal to consumers about the availability of price
information. The Commission has determined that the Rule's other price disclosure provisions are adequate, and
that this provision is unlikely to provide substantial additional benefits to consumers. Record evidence indicates
that the Rule is contributing now to increased consumer ``price-sensitivity'' that results in some consumer shopping
for lower-cost providers and services. Consumers who call to first arrange a date and time for a funeral service, however,
or who request the removal of remains, likely expect an empathetic response, and may be seriously offended by the uninvited
offer to discuss prices. Some consumers in that circumstance are likely to interpret the affirmative disclosure
as an indication of an unwarranted provider concern with the consumer's ability to afford services. The provision's
likely inability to benefit consumers does not justify the imposition of such undue awkwardness and potential offense
in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission has concluded
that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the requirement
to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request. 

The Commission further has adopted a variety of minor, ``fine-tuning'' amendments in light of the evidence on industry
compliance. Those amendments are designed to clarify the Rule's requirements and reduce actual or potential compliance
burdens in order to increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosures. Those
amendments, which do not alter providers' basic obligations or consumers' rights under the Rule, concern the timing
of giving the general price list and other disclosure requirements, the casket and outer burial container price list
disclosures, and the general ``unbundling'' provision. 

Finally, the Commission has adopted several technical Rule amendments that are necessary to correct inconsistencies
or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other recommended amendments.

10

 





C. Background of this Proceeding 



1. The Commission's Findings in 1982 



The Commission required this unique review to determine, at an early date: (1) Whether the Rule is operating as expected
in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing informed consumer choice, or whether some modification
is necessary to facilitate those benefits; and (2) whether there is a need to continue the Rule after it has had an opportunity
to work in the marketplace; termination would be considered if increased competition has largely corrected the problems
addressed by the Rule.

11

 





The Commission determined, however, that the Rule's effects on the funeral market may be evidenced more slowly than
in other industries due to factors it found unique to the funeral transaction.
 One of those factors was that many consumers would not have exposure to the Rule-required price lists and other provisions
for many years because purchases of funerals are infrequent. Unlike other situations, consumers also are unusually
susceptible to influence from the funeral director's advice because of the unique combination of emotional stress,
lack of experience and information, and tight time constraints. The Commission predicted as a result that the initial
stimulus for price competition would likely come from existing or new providers that begin to advertise and otherwise
compete on the basis of price. The Commission concluded that it could not say how quickly the Rule's competitive impact
would begin to be felt in light of traditional industry constraints on price competition and barriers to entry. 





The Commission nonetheless predicted that the Rule could provide economic benefits for consumers in various ways.

13

 Should greater price competition emerge, for example, the Rule could reduce or hold stable actual prices and overall
consumer expenditures for funerals. This would most likely result from increased consumer price-sensitivity,
which might lead some consumers to shift from higher to lower-priced providers. Expenditures could also be reduced
as consumers decline items previously required in packaged funerals, and as unfair or deceptive acts or practices
that induced consumer purchases decline. Finally, the Commission determined that mandatory price itemization
was warranted even if some consumers knowingly chose to buy more goods and services than they would have under package-only
pricing. The purpose of the Rule is to enhance consumer choice. 





The Commission finally determined that, while competition induced by the Rule could reduce price levels, mandatory
itemization presented opportunities for providers to voluntarily raise prices.

14

 Providers could choose to raise itemized prices or the price for the lowest-priced funeral, for example, in order
to increase profits or account for increased consumer declinations of certain items. The Commission reasoned, however,
that itemization does not require those results because it does not preclude traditional industry pricing methods,
such as package pricing and ``graduated recovery'' of proportionately more overhead from higher-priced funerals.
The Commission further concluded that providers may not be able to raise prices simply to recoup lost revenue or increase
profits as price competition increases under the Rule.

2. The Mandatory Review Proceeding 


The Commission on December 9, 1987 published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (hereafter ``ANPR'') describing
the planned review of the Funeral Rule.

15

 The ANPR notified the public that the Commission intended to conduct the rulemaking, and solicited public comments
on many of the key Rule-related issues. The ANPR contained 44 questions concerning consumer and funeral provider
experiences, the scope of the Rule, compliance, various Rule provisions, regulatory flexibility and the paperwork
burden imposed by the Rule. The majority of the commenters

16

 recommended retention of the Rule. Funeral director trade groups recommended repeal or, in the alternative, substantial
modification and expansion of the Rule to cover other sellers, such as cemeteries. 





Following a review and assessment of the comments, the Commission on May 31, 1988 published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(hereafter ``NPR'') initiating this review proceeding.

17

 The Commission in the NPR established a schedule for three public hearings to be held in Washington, Chicago, and San
Francisco, and requested comment on a number of questions set out in the notice. In all, 189 individuals and groups
submitted written comments, including two funeral directors, five cemetery/crematory/third-party casket seller
groups or individuals, six funeral director trade associations, 147 consumers, 27 consumer/memorial society groups,
one federal official and one state group. 




During the public hearings,

18

 testimony was received from sixteen funeral directors, five monument builders, one vault seller, sixteen cemeterians/cremationists,
one individual who provides business and consulting services to industry members, seven state officials, twenty
consumer advocates, nine consumers/ clergy/counselors, and eight economists/survey experts or consultants (one
economist testified twice). 




In April 1989, Rebuttal Submissions were filed by the staff, the Cremation Association of North America (``CANA''),
the Monument Builders of North America (``MBNA''), the National Funeral Directors Association (``NFDA'') and National
Selected Morticians (``NSM'') (joint rebuttal), the American Cemetery Association (``ACA''), the American Association
of Retired Persons (``AARP'') and the Pre-Arrangement Association of America (``PAA''). In response to a request
from the Presiding Officer, those groups other than the staff also filed Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law and Recommended Decision in May 1989. 
In addition to all of the testimonial and written information just described, the record contains three national
surveys of actual funeral arrangers, conducted in 1981, 1987 and 1988. The 1981 Baseline Study (or ``BLS'')

19

 was conceived as a benchmark for later comparison with the 1987 Replication Study (or ``RS'').

20

 Conducted for the Commission, these studies examined: (1) Consumer purchasing behavior and expenditures for funerals;
(2) consumer knowledge of the funeral market; and (3) industry practices and prices. By comparing the results of the
two studies, inferences could be drawn about the Funeral Rule's impact on the funeral market. The Bureau of Economics
Report of February 1989

21

 contains that comparative analysis. The Gallup Organization conducted the third, and most recent, study of funeral
arrangers for the AARP.

22

 Viewed together, those three empirical surveys represent the most reliable and comprehensive systematic data available
on consumer experiences under the Rule in shopping for and choosing funeral goods and services, and of industry Rule
compliance.

23

 








In addition to these empirical studies, statistical data and testimony presented by Mr. Wendell Hahn of the Federated
Funeral Directors of America (hereafter ``FFDA''), an independent firm that provides financial and business consulting
services to some 1,500 independent funeral homes in 30 states, representing about 10% of all funerals per year, afforded
evidence on changes in funeral home costs of operation and prices under the Rule. A 1988 national survey of 500 funeral
directors presented by the AARP provided similar evidence.

24

 A 1987 survey of state laws regulating the funeral transaction is also part of the record, as is the 1984 survey of NFDA
members regarding changes in provider practices under the Rule. The record further contains two national opinion
surveys concerning consumers' views about, and knowledge of, various Rule requirements, and five other surveys
of cemeterians, cremationists, monument builders and memorial societies conducted by interested groups on specific,
Rule-related issues.

The rulemaking staff and Presiding Officer published their respective Reports in June and July 1990, summarizing
the record evidence and recommending, with minor differences, retention of the Rule, repeal of the affirmative telephone
disclosure, prohibition of separate non-declinable fees, in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services
of funeral director and staff, such as so-called ``casket handling fees,'' and the adoption of several ``fine-tuning''
amendments.

25

 In response to the Presiding Officer's published invitation,

26

 forty-nine groups and individuals submitted comments on those reports by November 1, 1990.

27

 






On June 20, 1991, the Bureau of Consumer Protection forwarded its final recommendations to the Commission on this
review proceeding. The rulemaking staff continued the major recommendations contained in its 1990 Report, and,
together with the Bureau of Economics staff, jointly recommended a separate amendment concerning the disclosures
that are necessary whenever the fee for ``services of funeral director and staff'' is incorporated in the price of
caskets offered for sale.

28

 The Bureau of Economics concurred with all of the rulemaking staff's recommendations concerning substantive Rule
provisions.

29

 





On November 21, 1991, representatives of the NFDA, NSM, AARP, CANA, ACA, MBNA and PAA made oral presentations to the
Commission concerning this review proceeding. On January 28, 1993, after reviewing the rulemaking record as a whole,
the Commission voted unanimously to retain and amend the Rule, incorporating all of the substantive changes recommended
by the rulemaking staff and the Bureau of Economics. 


II. Basis for the Amended Rule 


A. The Legal Standard for Amending the Rule 


Section 18(d)(2)(B) of the FTC Act states that ``[a] substantive amendment to, or repeal of, a rule promulgated under
subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be prescribed, and subject to judicial review, in the same manner as a rule prescribed
under such subsection.''

30

 Thus, the standard of judicial review for amendment to, or repeal of, a section 18 rule is identical to that for any rule
prescribed pursuant to section 18. Upon judicial review, a section 18 rule may be set aside if it is ``arbitrary, capricious''
or otherwise not in accordance with law upon any of the grounds set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
at 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)-(D), or if the factual determinations upon which the rule is based are not supported by
``substantial evidence'' in the rulemaking record as a whole.

31

 





In their Proposed Findings, funeral director groups assert 
that the current rulemaking is subject to the same standards and procedures as a de novo rulemaking. Therefore, they
appear to contend that the Commission must support any decision, including the retention of the Funeral Rule, on a
new administrative record compiled afresh.

32

 




This view is incorrect. A decision to retain any portion of the current Rule may be based upon evidence gathered during
the original rulemaking and the Commission's subsequent enforcement experience, as well as evidence adduced during
the current rulemaking. Indeed, to the extent that nothing supplements evidence from the initial rulemaking, there
is a presumption that the existing rule should be retained.

33

 




As discussed elsewhere in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, the Commission has evaluated the relative costs and
benefits of the Rule, industry compliance, the Rule's effect on competition and consumer awareness, and a number
of other factors, to determine whether to retain, amend, or repeal the Rule. In making that determination, the Commission
has taken into account, among other things, the comments received in this rulemaking as well as the record established
in the original rulemaking proceeding and the Commission's experience in enforcing the existing Rule. The Commission
believes that its decision to retain certain provisions of the Rule while supplementing or amending others, as described
in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, comports with the legal standards discussed earlier governing Section 18
rules. 


B. Overall Costs and Benefits of the Rule 


1. Repeal vs. Retention: Participants' Views 


The vast majority of rulemaking participants supported the Rule's retention, or its expansion to cover other sellers.
Of the 189 NPR commenters and 83 public hearing witnesses, only eight unequivocally advocated repeal of the Rule.

34

 Two participants suggested repeal as an alternative, if the Commission declined to make various substantive amendments;
two advocated repeal because, in their view, existing state laws were deemed adequate to protect consumers.

35

<TEXT>
 

The NFDA, the largest association of funeral industry firms, was the major proponent of repeal,
 asserting that repeal is warranted because the Rule has imposed significant costs but failed to provide its promised
benefits of increased competition and altered patterns of consumer behavior. According to the NFDA, the evidence
shows that consumers in selecting funeral providers and types of funeral service still place a higher importance
on social, moral and practical factors (such as provider reputation and quality of service) than they do on price.
 The NFDA concluded that the evidence logically demonstrates that consumers under the Rule spend no less for funeral
arrangements, comparison shop no more, and purchase no fewer items and no different types of service than they did
before the Rule. The NFDA asserted that the Rule has imposed various monetary costs on providers that have been passed
on to consumers in the form of higher prices, as well as non-monetary costs that interfere with providers' ability
to give caring, quality service. The NFDA thus concluded that the Rule should be repealed in its entirety because its
costs outweigh its benefits.
 








In contrast to the NFDA's view, the AARP provided the most vigorous support for retention of the Rule.
 The AARP advocated that a decision to repeal the Rule must be founded on substantial evidence demonstrating that:
(1) The acts and practices addressed by the Rule are no longer prevalent; (2) the harm resulting from those practices
has been removed; (3) repeal would not permit the return of that harm; and (4) the benefits of repeal exceed the costs
of continuing the Rule. According to the AARP, those questions cannot be answered, and the Rule's full impact cannot
be assessed, because the record evidence reveals unacceptably low levels of industry compliance and consumer awareness
of the Rule's provisions. Because the Rule's full impact cannot be gauged, the AARP concluded, repeal is unwarranted.
The AARP further asserted that the evidence indicates that the Rule has not increased funeral providers' costs, funeral
prices, or consumer expenditures, but has begun to provide a variety of consumer benefits. The AARP thus further concluded
that, although the Commission need not meet a specific evidentiary burden to retain the Rule, such evidence exists
to support the conclusion that the Rule's benefits exceed its costs.
 





2. Costs and Benefits Compared 


The Commission has concluded, based on its review of the rulemaking record viewed as a whole, that the Rule warrants
retention because its actual and potential benefits to consumers outweigh its costs to providers, and that those
benefits are likely to increase over time as the Rule continues to operate. The Commission finds that, at the time of
this review: 
(1) The Rule has not been effective in the funeral market for a sufficient period to permit a full assessment of its benefits;

(2) The market is increasingly price-sensitive for the selection of funeral providers, types of service, and individual
goods and services, particularly caskets, when price and options information is readily available during the selection
process; 
(3) Despite a documented, low overall compliance level, pro-competitive and informational benefits attributable
in part to the Rule appear to be manifesting in the market and are likely to increase over time; 
(4) The Rule overall imposes minimal compliance burdens on providers that do not significantly raise their business
costs or prices, or reduce consumers' satisfaction with the funeral services they receive; and 
(5) Most states have not adopted laws similar to the Rule in scope and coverage, and such action is not likely in the near
future. 


a. Levels of compliance/price competition/consumer Awareness. 

The evidence in the record indicates, at the time of this review, a low level of industry compliance with the Rule. Systematic,
empirical data from two independent surveys_the Commission-sponsored, 1987 Replication Study and the 1988 Gallup
Study conducted for the AARP_show that 36% of funeral providers simultaneously complied with the Rule's two key requirements
to give consumers a general price list (``GPL'') and an itemized final statement of goods and services selected.
 Using the more comprehensive Replication Study results, that overall compliance level dropped to 31% when misrepresentation
provisions about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation are added to the analysis,
 and to 9% when the GPL timing requirement is viewed strictly and several other Rule provisions are considered.
 Most rulemaking participants opined, when asked, that a 30% level of compliance would be insufficient to assess adequately
the Rule's benefits.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to the relatively low level of overall industry Rule compliance, the rulemaking record demonstrates
that funeral providers have not provided the initial stimulus for ``increased competition'' on the basis of price
considered necessary by the Commission. The few funeral home entrants that aggressively compete on price, documented
in the record, appear to be former, more traditional funeral directors who reentered the market as ``discount'' providers,
and who are considered to be ``mavericks'' by the funeral industry as a whole. More traditional funeral homes, by industry
representatives' own admission, generally do not price advertise or otherwise compete on the basis of price.
 The record further indicates that funeral providers show little support for unfettered competition in the sale of
pre-need funeral services,
 and that many affirmatively attempt to discourage potential price competition from third-party cemeteries and
other non-funeral home retailers who sell caskets on a pre-need basis, by imposing so-called ``casket handling fees,''
averaging $300-$500 per funeral on consumers who patronize those sellers.
 






Finally, the empirical data and record testimony documents that a majority of consumers exhibit low levels of awareness
concerning their rights under the Rule
 and funeral prices and service options,
 as a result of a general lack of ``visibility'' of the Rule and of readily-available, comparative price information.
 Other empirical evidence indicates that consumers' ``experience'' with funerals is low by any measure
 and that, regardless of their level of experience, consumers are not ``familiar'' with the funeral transaction.
 Most rulemaking participants concluded that the documented low levels of overall industry compliance and consumer
knowledge, viewed together, indicate that the Rule has not been in place long enough to adequately assess its impact
on the funeral market.

b. Market price-sensitivity. 

Consumers' demand for funerals, of course, is price inelastic. Record evidence indicates, however, that consumers'
selections of individual funeral providers, overall types of funeral service, and individual funeral goods and
services are price-sensitive. 

Consumers value available price information in selecting a funeral home and in making specific funeral arrangements,
particularly when they receive the price information early in selecting funeral goods and services. With respect
to the selection of a provider, 52% of NSM survey respondents in the years 1983-1988 said that they considered
price ``very important'' in their funeral home selection, although other factors appeared to be more important;
only 19% considered price unimportant.
 Similarly, ``low-cost'' funeral homes, where they exist, have increased their business substantially in recent
years as a direct result of their competitive pricing practices.
 Regarding the selection of specific goods and services, many consumers are purchasing competitively-priced caskets
from third-party sellers when they are available,
 are increasingly choosing the significantly less-expensive cremation alternative,
 are purchasing significantly fewer caskets and requesting embalming for cremation less frequently than in 1981,
 and are declining items that used to be included in funeral ``packages.''
 Replication Study consumers who received price information early in the transaction spent $252 less for their specific
arrangements than those who did not get that timely information;
 the earlier consumers received price information, the more likely they were to consider the information important
to their choices in making funeral arrangements.















c. Pro-competitive/informational benefits. 

Despite the 31% overall industry compliance level with four of the Rule's key requirements
 and the lack of price competition among funeral homes, competitive and informational benefits that are at least partially
attributable to the Rule have begun to manifest in the funeral market. Testimonial evidence establishes that the
Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure provisions have encouraged third-party casket sellers and low-cost
funeral homes to enter the market and have helped them compete,
 in part because the GPL and telephone disclosure requirements permit non-industry entities to gather and publish
comparative price data.
 Many consumers have used that data to select those lower-cost funeral providers and purchase caskets from third-party
sellers where they exist.

Other testimonial evidence presented by the FFDA, which provides financial and accounting services to 1,500 independent
funeral home clients in 30 states, indicates that the Rule_through the availability of the GPL_has raised the industry's
``price consciousness,'' which may be partly responsible for the tempering of price increases in recent years.
 Mandatory itemization may have helped retard the growth of funeral prices and consumer expenditures, a goal fully
intended by the Commission.
 Statistical data provided by the FFDA and the Replication Study, and analyzed by an economist for the AARP and the BE
staff, also establish that, although overall prices and consumer expenditures for funerals increased since 1981
by more than the general price level (the ``CPI-U''), which includes all goods and services, the increase was
comparable to the increase in service prices (the ``CPI-US,'' which excludes medical services); that is, compared
to other service industries,
 funeral prices and expenditures in the period 1981-1987 did not increase above the rate of inflation.
 In 1988, expenditures and prices for funeral services increased by even less than the rate of inflation for the general
economy (the ``CPI-U'').
 









In addition to these benefits, record evidence discussed above suggests that the Rule has helped increase consumers'
awareness of prices and service options as factors to consider in making funeral purchase decisions. Many consumers
choose low-cost funeral homes and caskets competitively offered by third-party providers, and consumers who chose
cremation in 1987 purchased fewer caskets and embalming than in 1981. Finally, that evidence indicated that consumers
now decline items once included in packaged funerals, and increasingly choose less-expensive cremation alternatives.
 





Other empirical evidence indicates that, since 1981, the proportion of consumers who receive price information
early in the funeral transaction, and use that information to spend less for their arrangements, has increased by
7%.
 Consumer purchases of ``unneeded'' caskets and embalming for cremation have decreased,
 as have provider misrepresentations about casket requirements,
 and the accuracy of consumers' knowledge regarding casket for cremation and embalming requirements and the preservative
value of sealed caskets has increased slightly.
 The great majority of rulemaking participants expressed the view that the actual and potential Rule benefits just
enumerated will tend to increase over time, as compliance with, and consumer awareness of, the Rule increases.
 









Although not directly related to pro-competitive and informational benefits, other empirical evidence based on
the Replication Study data and BE staff's compliance indices indicates that the proportion of consumers reporting
satisfaction with their arrangements steadily increases as simultaneous provider compliance with the Rule's provisions
increases.
 That evidence indicates that compliance with the Rule benefits consumers and funeral providers by increasing consumer
satisfaction with funeral service, and that the level of satisfaction might continue to increase if compliance with
the Rule were greater. 







d. Costs to providers. 

While the Rule has begun to provide benefits to consumers, empirical evidence demonstrates that its requirements
have not been a significant contributing factor to increases in funeral home costs of doing business or funeral home
prices, or to any reduction of overall consumer satisfaction with funeral services. Funeral provider groups, however,
asserted that the Rule has imposed on providers a variety of increased costs, most notably for personnel as a result
of a 23-minute average increase in the duration of the arrangements conference, and for business expenses such as
printing, accounting and legal services. These costs, those groups said, have been passed on to consumers in the form
of higher prices, particularly for professional services.

Statistical business expense data for the years 1977-1987 presented by the FFDA,


78

 and analyzed by an economist for the AARP, indicates that funeral home costs arguably most related to the Rule (such
as legal, accounting and consulting costs) have increased at lower rates than other expenses (such as depreciation
and casket cost),


79

 and that overall cost increases have resulted more from a general increase in all business expenses than from a dramatic
increase in any one expense category.


80

 Mr. Hahn of the FFDA further testified that the Rule has played a very minor role in business expense and price increases,


81

 which he and other witnesses attributed generally to inflation and individual funeral home business decisions.


82

 









Further record analysis of the FFDA statistical data by BE staff indicates that funeral homes' personnel expenses
appear to have increased very slightly since 1984, but that personnel expense as a proportion of overall business
expense has not significantly changed in many years, including the period covered by the Rule. Similar analysis shows
that salary expense as a proportion of personnel cost has likewise remained stable.


83

 Mr. Hahn of the FFDA testified that significant changes in those areas should have occurred if the Rule were significantly
increasing funeral homes' personnel costs.


84

 









e. State Regulation of Funeral Providers.

 The rulemaking record finally documents that most individual states favor the continued existence and strong enforcement
of the Funeral Rule to protect funeral consumers, rather than reliance on the states to adopt comprehensive, state-specific
legislation. A 1987 staff survey of the states' funeral industry statutes, regulations and rules revealed that ten
states have incorporated the Rule by reference into their laws or adopted provisions similar to six of the Rule's most
salient requirements; six have enacted at least four of those provisions, and, overall, thirteen to twenty-five
states have laws that include one or more provisions similar to the Rule.

85

 No party presented evidence during the review that additional states have adopted relevant funeral laws or that existing
laws have been significantly strengthened. 




Testimonial evidence presented by state legislators and officials further indicates that, although the Rule has
helped stimulate the enactment of similar funeral industry laws in several states, such reform is unlikely in their
or other states because of industry opposition. Those witnesses expressed their views that the Funeral Rule needs
to be retained as a result, and is beneficial to consumers, funeral providers, and state enforcement officials.

86

 





C. Section-by-Section Analysis 



1. Introduction 



The Rule as amended contains two major changes_deletion of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement and
the prohibition of non-declinable fees (such as so-called ``casket handling fees'' and ``basic facilities fees'')
charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic professional services of the funeral director and staff.
These primary changes, and a number of ``fine-tuning'' amendments, are intended to increase the Rule's benefits
and reduce its costs by facilitating funeral providers' compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's
requirements, while preserving the integrity of the Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure requirements.

Finally, the Commission has made several technical amendments to the Rule that are necessary to correct inconsistencies
or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other amendments. 



2. Affirmative Telephone Disclosure Repeal: Section 453.2(b)(1)(i) 



Section 453.2(b)(1)(i) of the original Rule required funeral providers to affirmatively tell persons who call and
ask about the ``terms, conditions, or prices'' at which funeral goods or funeral services are offered that price information
is available over the telephone. The Commission has decided that the affirmative telephone disclosure provision
should be deleted from the Rule because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits to consumers, and because
the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retaining the requirement to provide
price information over the telephone on request. 

The Commission designed this provision to help consumers in two ways. First, it would alert them to the availability
of price information over the telephone, and, second, it might diminish consumers' reluctance to seek such information.
The Commission intended that affirmative disclosure provision to facilitate consumers' comparison shopping for
a provider.


87

 




Empirical evidence presented by the Replication Study, however, indicated that few consumers comparison shop before
selecting a provider. The Commission in the NPR thus requested public comment on whether: (1) Consumers are aware
of their right to seek price information over the telephone; (2) compliance with this provision is costly; and (3)
it should retain the affirmative telephone disclosure provision in view of the study results.

Empirical and testimonial evidence in the record provided insights into the delicate relationship between consumers
and funeral providers that appear to affect the degree to which consumers seek price information directly from providers.
Results from the Baseline, Replication and Gallup Studies indicated that consumers seldom seek price information
or comparison shop by calling providers directly. In 1981, 7.2% of the Baseline Study respondents comparison shopped
by contacting more than one funeral home;

89

 4.2% of the 1987 Replication Study respondents did so,

90

 and 11% of the 1988 Gallup Study consumers contacted more than one provider.

91

 Most 1987 Replication Study respondents knew which funeral provider they intended to use,

92

 and those who had not decided on a funeral provider usually contacted only one at the time of need.

93

 In the initial telephone contact, RS respondents asked about ``prices, terms or conditions'' only 9.2% of the time.

94

 










Record evidence indicated that both consumers and providers are reluctant to initiate price discussions during
funeral arrangements.

95

 The evidence indicates that, unlike a visit to the funeral home, where the general price list facilitates the actual
review of services and merchandise, the offer to discuss prices over the telephone is helpful only if the consumer
is prepared to do so. The weight of the evidence demonstrates that the initial telephone contact is a tentative encounter
in which the consumer is relying on the funeral provider to set the tone of the interaction. The funeral provider at
that delicate time, however, reasonably wishes to avoid the appearance of insensitivity by raising price issues
when the callers' typical concerns are whether and how to arrange the funeral with the particular provider. 





Several provider witnesses

96

 testified that the affirmative telephone disclosure has offended callers, who interpret the disclosure as an indication
of the funeral provider's preoccupation with the consumer's ability to afford services.

97

 For example, a state funeral board member observed that, whenever a client calls first to arrange a date and time for
a funeral service, expecting an empathic response, the consumer is offended by the funeral director's uninvited
statement that price information is available, and the funeral provider resentful about having to make such a statement
at this early juncture.

98

 Other providers distinguished between the accepted practice of giving price information that is requested, and
the difficulty of telling the caller who has not requested it that the funeral provider is prepared to talk about prices.

99

 Funeral director representatives concluded that providers' goodwill is harmed as a result of the offense generated
by the unsolicited affirmative disclosure, which providers under the Rule must make during the initial telephone
contact.

100

 









The evidence further shows that providers experience difficulty in understanding their obligation under  453.2
(b)(1)(i). Under that affirmative disclosure provision, a funeral provider must either tell every caller that price
information is available, or determine whether an inquiry concerns a ``term,'' ``condition,'' or ``price'' of funeral
goods or funeral services offered, thus triggering the disclosure. The original staff Compliance Guidelines illustrated
that problem; the Guidelines told funeral providers that a call asking whether the provider will perform a funeral
for a particular religion does not trigger the disclosure, whereas a call asking whether the provider will remove
the deceased from a hospital does.

101

 The difficulty of determining whether an inquiry concerns a ``term'' or ``condition'' thus places a clear burden
on the provider, without a commensurate benefit to the caller.

102

 






Other empirical data indicate that the disclosure does not affect consumers' expenditures for funeral arrangements.
Economic analysis of the Replication Study data indicated that those consumers who called the provider and received
the Rule-required affirmative disclosure spent no less for their arrangements than other respondents.

103

<TEXT>
 

Consumer group participants, however, suggested that the affirmative disclosure was meant to signal consumers
who are reluctant to raise price issues that it is acceptable to do so, and that providers can find ways to make that disclosure
without offending consumers.

104

 Although the empirical evidence is not conclusive on the issue, the preponderance of the reliable anecdotal evidence
provided by many funeral directors who must make the disclosure to consumers supports the conclusion that the requirement's
potential to overcome consumers' inhibitions and benefit additional consumers is unlikely, and does not justify
the imposition of awkwardness and potential offense in a transaction already fraught with delicate business, social
and personal issues. 





In summary, the record evidence shows that consumers rarely price shop for a funeral home or seek price information
directly from providers because of their reluctance to do so and their general lack of awareness about prices charged
by providers, and not because of a conviction that price information cannot be requested over the telephone. The affirmative
disclosure that price information is available thus does not appear to give consumers new information that is likely
to increase their desire to ask about prices or to encourage price shopping. 


The record evidence further indicates, however, that the Rule overall is contributing to increased consumer ``price
sensitivity'' that leads some additional consumers to use the telephone to shop for lower-cost providers, or to seek
comparative price information from non-industry sources. Consequently, consumers who want price information
will affirmatively use the telephone to seek such information from providers who advertise prices, or to engage in
alternative shopping methods, such as calling memorial societies, media price ``hotlines,'' or state agencies
that make comparative price information available.

105

 The Commission has concluded that consumers will increasingly seek price information as their awareness, and the
availability, of comparative price information increases. 




The preponderance of the evidence in the rulemaking record indicates that the affirmative telephone disclosure
is an inartful and unnecessary signal to consumers about the availability of price information that is unlikely,
over time, to provide substantial benefits to consumers not afforded by the Rule's other price disclosure provisions.

106

 






In light of this evidence, the Commission has determined to repeal the affirmative telephone disclosure provision
because its potential to benefit additional consumers is unlikely, and does not warrant the intrusion of potential
offense in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission further
concludes that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the general
requirement to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request ( 453.2(B)(1)).




Funeral provider representatives, however, suggested that such action would concede what they consider the Rule's
premise that increased comparison shopping was necessary to cure ``supracompetitive'' prices.

107

 That suggestion, however, overstates the importance of the disclosure to achieve the goal of increasing comparison
shopping, and fails to acknowledge record evidence indicating that the Rule overall already has contributed to increased
price competition.

108

 





The Commission in its Statement of Basis and Purpose for the Rule clearly expressed its view that the general telephone
requirement to give price information on request, and the requirement to give the GPL to any person seeking in-person
information about funeral arrangements, in addition to the affirmative telephone disclosure, would all contribute
to increased comparison shopping.

109

 Nevertheless, the Commission did not base the Rule's entire success in reducing barriers to price competition on
the affirmative telephone disclosure or on comparison shopping, because it fully recognized that such behavior
might always be infrequent.

110

 As described above, the Rule's provisions already are providing pro-competitive benefits to consumers, including
increased price sensitivity, despite the low overall levels of industry compliance, price competition and consumer
knowledge demonstrated by the record. Those benefits are likely to increase over time as industry compliance with,
and consumer awareness of, the Rule's other provisions increases. 





3. ``Casket Handling Fees:'' Section 453.4(b)(1)(ii) 




One benefit the Commission ascribed to the Rule in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose was that ``the greater availability
of price information may encourage entry into the funeral market of new competitors seeking to attract business by
offering lower prices.''

111

 That prospective benefit was important to the Rule's remedial intent, because the Commission found that the funeral
industry had historically opposed price advertising.

112

 The Commission concluded that, as a result of that reluctance to make price information readily available, consumers
purchased unwanted items and paid higher than competitive prices for items they selected.

113

 






The Commission further recognized that easy access to the market and a fair chance to compete were prerequisites to
the entry of new retailers into the funeral market.

114

 The Rule's general ``unbundling'' provision,  453.4(b), afforded that opportunity to new entrants by removing
the primary industry restraint on consumer choice_package-only pricing.

115

 The Commission found that, by ``bundling'' all funeral goods and services in a package, funeral providers had effectively
forced consumers to buy unwanted items as a condition of providing a necessity that only they can provide: disposition
of the remains.

116

 Section 453.4(b) of the Rule prohibits funeral providers from conditioning the furnishing of one funeral product
or service upon the purchase of another product or service unless required by law, such as embalming for interstate
shipping, or as a ``practical necessity,'' such as embalming where the consumer wants a viewing of the remains for
several days.

Some ANPR commenters asserted that funeral providers, in response to emerging competition in the sale of caskets
from cemeteries and other third-parties, charge high ``casket handling fees'' for arrangements where consumers
supply their own caskets purchased from those third parties.

117

 The alleged purpose of these fees was to recoup overhead costs and profits built into casket prices but lost on the third-party
casket sales. The Commission in the NPR thus sought comment on the existence and impact of so-called ``casket handling
fees,'' and on whether, and how, the Rule should address that practice.

118

 







a. Existence and impact. 

Members of the third-party, casket seller industry

119

 provided empirical and other evidence on the purpose, widespread existence and impact of these ``casket handling
fees.'' Casket seller representatives asserted that the emergence of third-party casket sellers is directly attributable
to the Funeral Rule's ``unbundling'' provision; those sales were virtually non-existent before the Rule.

120

 A PAA official who presented the results of a PAA membership survey (the ``PAA Survey'') on handling fee issues, Mr.
Duke Radovich, estimated that there are between 100 and 200 casket retailers in the country.

121

 






The PAA Survey provided empirical evidence on the widespread existence and amount of ``casket handling fees,'' as
reported by the respondent retailers. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said that at least 60% of the funeral
homes in their market area assess handling fees, about two-thirds said that 80% to 100% charge the fees, and one-quarter
reported that all of the homes impose the casket handling fee.

122

 Mr. Radovich concluded that a substantial number of providers assess ``casket handling fees'' wherever third-party
sellers exist.

123

 Individual casket retailers agreed with that finding,

124

 and further testified that funeral providers began imposing handling fees when third-party casket sellers entered
the market.

125

 







Concerning the amount of ``casket handling fees'' assessed, 81% of the PAA Survey respondents said that the average
handling fee was over $300; 74% reported an average fee between $300 and $500.

126

 Sixty-two percent of the PAA Survey respondents further reported that the highest fee charged was over $500; 35% said
that the largest fee was over $700.

127

 A ``handling fee'' of $500 was nearly equal to the average wholesale cost of a casket in 1988 ($517) and 60% of the average
casket mark-up in that year ($821).

128

 Wendell Hahn of the FFDA, which provides financial advising services to 1,500 providers in 30 states, testified that
handling fees are assessed because providers, who typically charge professional service fees ``hundreds of dollars''
below their true operation cost, will try to recoup those costs that are lost by the third-party casket sale. Mr. Hahn
concluded that handling fees are thus roughly equal to the amount that providers' non-declinable service fees are
underpriced.

129

Record evidence indicates that ``casket handling fees'' prevent potential price competition and reduce consumer
choice. Ninety-two percent of the casket seller respondents to the PAA Survey reported that their casket sales have
declined since the imposition of handling fees; about one-third said that they have reduced or eliminated their casket
marketing efforts as a result of those fees.

130

 One industry observer testified that ``casket handling fees'' have caused the exit from the casket market of five
small businesses who thought that they could gain market share by offering third-party caskets at lower prices.

131

 Several casket retailers and others also asserted that these so-called ``handling fees'' impede price competition
by removing consumers' incentive to price-shop for less costly caskets, and penalize consumers who do shop.

132








Finally, third-party sellers testified that market forces will not effectively regulate ``casket handling fees,''
and that the elimination of those discriminatory fees would result in increased competition in the sale of caskets
and reduced casket prices.

133

 Mr. Royal Keith, a funeral provider appearing for the NFDA, when asked on cross-examination about the effect of market
forces on handling fees, responded that he was not aware of any cases where market forces have successfully reduced
the amount of handling fees charged in a particular area.

134









b. Providers' basis for imposing ``casket handling fees''.

 Proponents of handling fees did not provide evidence to refute that offered by casket retailers and others on the purpose,
prevalence and impact of ``casket handling fees'' on the casket market. Funeral provider representatives, for example,
did not dispute that ``casket handling fees'' are used to recoup profits and overhead costs lost to third-party casket
sales, but defended that purpose on several grounds.

135

 Providers' responses to third-party casket sales arise, the trade groups asserted, due to the industry's long-standing
tradition of recovering much of its overhead costs and profits through the casket mark-up, and not by increasing service
fees; lower service fees allow funeral homes to provide full service funerals, including lower-priced caskets,
to those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. Although providers in recent years have shifted some of that
casket mark-up to service fees, the shift has been very gradual. The industry groups concluded that providers who
lose casket sales to third parties must, as a result, still forego the recovery of much of their costs and profits that
would have been included in the casket sale.




Those groups asserted that the imposition of ``casket handling fees'' is an isolated, non-discriminatory practice
that fairly allocates providers' overhead costs and profits; the purpose of the fee is to obtain from consumers who
buy third-party caskets consumers' proportionate share of providers' costs and profits for rendering the funeral
service. Providers' only alternative to handling fees, the industry groups argued, would be to raise service fees
charged to all consumers, which, in effect, would require regular clients who purchase providers' caskets to subsidize
the funerals of consumers who purchase their caskets elsewhere_by paying the mark-up on the casket as well as the higher
service fee that would result from other consumers supplying their own caskets.
Those groups further asserted that handling fees are not assessed for ship-ins, outer burial container sales traditionally
lost to competing cemeteries, or for direct cremation/immediate burials where the consumer supplies the alternative
container because, unlike the unexpected loss of a casket sale to a third-party seller, providers set prices for those
services with the knowledge that they will not make a sale in those cases. Finally, the funeral groups concluded that
the amount of ``casket handling fees'' is sufficiently regulated by the market, because providers that charge unreasonably
high fees will offend consumers and lose market share.

136








c. Commission's conclusion and amendment.

 The Commission has concluded that substantial ``casket handling fees'' are imposed on consumers by a significant
proportion of providers wherever third-party casket sellers exist, and, as a result, frustrate the Rule's ``unbundling''
requirements and result in the reduction of potential competition in the sale of caskets fostered by the Funeral Rule.

137

 Some providers are forced to impose handling fees because of their competitive reluctance to shift overhead costs
and profit from the casket mark-up to professional service fees.

138

 Others may use handling fees as a direct response to third-party competition. In either case, the issue to be determined
in this proceeding was whether the Rule should allow providers to condition a consumer's right under the Rule to obtain
a funeral service with a consumer-supplied casket upon the payment of a non-declinable fee, charged in addition to
the basic professional services fee (already permitted under the Rule to be non-declinable), or whether the Rule
should require providers to recoup costs and profits lost to third-party casket sales in ways that do not violate the
intent of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision. For example, providers under the Rule may recoup any unallocated
costs or profits lost to third-party casket sales in the non-declinable professional services fee permitted by  453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).
The Commission has determined that the latter course is warranted to affirm the Rule's intent to increase consumer
choice and reduce barriers to price competition.

Section 453.4(b) of the Funeral Rule was intended to address all ``bundling'' arrangements imposed on consumers
by funeral providers. Under that provision, consumers have the right to decline the purchase of any item, including
a casket, from a funeral provider, and may elect to supply their own. That right, however, is illusory if funeral providers
can condition consumers' choice on the payment of an additional, non-declinable fee. The fee, in any amount, penalizes
consumers for exercising their choice afforded by the Rule.

139






``Casket handling fees'' require consumers to pay two substantial mark-ups, one on the casket they purchase from
the third-party seller, and another on the casket they did not buy from the funeral provider. The evidence indicates
that handling fees average between $300 and $500, and often are higher. That burden, the evidence shows, effectively
removes consumers' economic incentive to purchase a casket from anyone but the funeral provider. Casket sales by
third parties have declined as a result, and several retailers have curtailed their marketing efforts or withdrawn
from the market. Handling fees thus frustrate the purpose of the Funeral Rule_to ensure informed consumer choice
and foster a competitive funeral market. The Commission thus concludes that casket handling fees are unfair conditions
on a consumer's right to decline unwanted items he or she may wish to purchase elsewhere, in violation of section 5 of
the FTC Act, and the spirit of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision ( 453.4(b)).

Section 453.4(b), however, does not specifically address the practice of conditioning the furnishing of any funeral
goods or services on the payment of fees, such as ``casket handling'' fees, because those fees have developed since
the Rule's implementation, and because they are not conditioned charges for ``goods'' or ``services''_the conditioned
products referred to in that provision. The Commission thus has concluded that so-called ``casket handling'' fees,
and other non-declinable fees that are more aptly referred to as ``recovery of overhead and profit'' fees, need to
be separately addressed in the Rule.

141

 






The Commission recognizes the legitimate desire and expectation of funeral industry members to recover overhead
costs and realize a profit. The Rule, however, permits consumers to select and buy only the items wanted unless state
or local law require otherwise. The Funeral Rule is designed to permit funeral providers to have one non-declinable
fee to recover general overhead costs_the fee for the basic services of funeral director and staff. Permitting funeral
providers to have additional surcharges, whether they are called ``casket handling fees,'' or something else, would
frustrate the Rule's aim to promote full itemization and informed consumer choice. 

To prevent that result and clarify the current requirements of the Rule, the Commission has added paragraph (b)(1)(ii)
to  453.4 of the Rule. That amendment prohibits as an unfair or deceptive act or practice the furnishing of funeral
goods or services upon payment of any conditional ``fees'' not otherwise permitted by the Rule. The amendment, however,
permits funeral providers to recover overhead in the two ways permitted by the original Rule_by marking up the items
offered for sale to the public, and by having the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director and staff,
permitted by   453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A) of the Rule. 
The Commission also has amended  453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)(2) of the Rule to require, among other things, disclosure
of: (1) The dollar amount charged for any non-declinable basic professional services when that charge is included
in the price of the provider's caskets; and (2) the statement ``This same fee shall be added to the total cost of your
funeral arrangements if you provide the casket.'' These amendments are intended to have the same effect as the amendment
to  453.4(b) above_they prohibit funeral providers (who choose not to itemize the charge for basic professional
services) from charging consumers who purchase caskets from third parties a non-declinable fee for recovery of overhead
and profit in addition to the professional services fee charged to all customers. 
These two amendments are not intended to impede funeral providers from recovering overhead costs and earning profits
from their operations. Efficient providers can structure their prices charged to all consumers to recover the revenue
lost to third-party casket (or other merchandise) sales. The evidence indicates that providers for many years have
so adjusted their pricing structure to account for consumer-supplied caskets (in ship-in cases), outer burial containers,
and alternative containers.

142

 




Providers asserted that the impact of a ban on imposing separate, non-declinable casket handling fees, in addition
to the non-declinable professional services fee, would be increased professional service fees to all consumers.
The funeral provider industry made the same argument in the original proceeding regarding the effect of consumer
declinations caused by Rule-required itemization.

143

 As the Commission reasoned at that time, providers under the Rule can set or shift prices as they wish, but the long-term
competitive impact of the Rule's price availability provisions might not permit providers to recover lost revenue
from casket declinations simply by raising professional service fees. In the short-term, some consumers might spend
more and some less than they would without the right to decline if providers actually raise service fees in order to
recoup revenue lost to third-party casket sales. As discussed earlier, however, the evidence in this proceeding
indicates that, although service fees generally are underpriced by roughly the average handling fee amount, providers
are reluctant to raise service fees even under current competitive conditions. In any event, the evidence indicates
that the impact of a ban on handling fees would more likely be increased competition in the sale of caskets, and, in turn,
an overall reduction in casket prices over time.

144

 







4. GPL Timing/Distribution Requirements. 

Section 453.2(b)(4) of the Rule required providers to give for retention a General Price List to persons who inquire
in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services. The GPL must contain, among other
things, several disclosures about consumers' right to select only those items they desire and the retail prices for
17 specified items, if offered for sale. Providers under  453.2(b)(4)(i) of the original Rule were required
to offer the GPL ``

upon beginning discussion either of funeral arrangements or of the selection of any funeral goods or funeral services.''

Many funeral providers, however, erroneously believe that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation of preliminary
arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. That misinterpretation leads
them to offer the GPL at arguably inappropriate times, such as during preliminary discussions of death certificates
or veterans benefits, or, in the case of an out-of-town death, the location of the deceased.

145

 




To remedy their concerns, provider groups proposed repeal of the GPL timing and distribution requirements, or, in
the alternative, amendments that would require providers to: 

(1) ``Make available'' to consumers a GPL; 
(2) Offer the GPL to consumers who inquire only about prices; 
(3) Offer the GPL to consumers before ``specific'' funeral goods or funeral services are ``selected'' or prices discussed;
and 
(4) Give a GPL for retention only to those consumers who request to keep it.

146

 




The Commission has determined, however, that the preponderance of the evidence does not warrant the sweeping amendments
to, or repeal of,  453.2(b)(4)(i) as proposed by funeral provider groups. The Commission draws that conclusion
particularly in light of the empirical evidence on the level of providers' compliance with the current GPL requirements
(23% give the GPL at the outset of arrangements discussions), and the evidence that consumers want price and options
information about funeral goods and services and value price information that they receive early in the funeral transaction.

The Commission is persuaded by that compliance evidence, however, that some fine-tuning is necessary to clarify
the Rule and promote increased compliance, thereby enhancing the Rule's opportunity to provide benefits to consumers.
The amendment discussed below thus is intended to remove any ambiguities and unnecessary rigidity in  453.2(b)(4)(i)
that appear to cause funeral directors to misinterpret their obligations under that provision. 

Provider group proposals would have unacceptably narrowed the circumstances in which providers would be required
to provide a GPL to consumers. First, the suggestion that providers ``make available'' a GPL might have been tantamount
to effective repeal of the entire GPL requirement if such language means something other than physically giving the
GPL to consumers.

147

 Consumers might receive no GPL disclosures about funeral service prices or options, or concerning their rights in
the funeral transaction under the Rule or other laws, unless they asked to see the GPL and providers voluntarily complied
with their request. Such a change is not warranted, given record evidence on relatively low, overall levels of Rule
compliance. Other evidence_that consumers are reluctant to raise price issues after the death of a loved one, that
consumers, nonetheless, desire price and service options information, and that consumers benefit from price information
they receive early in the funeral transaction_also supports this conclusion. 





Second, the NFDA suggestion that providers need only give a GPL to persons who inquire in person about the ``price''
of funeral goods or services would eliminate the obligation to give a GPL to those who ask about prices 

or

 ``funeral arrangements.'' In light of the evidence just mentioned, this proposed narrowing of the GPL distribution
requirement is not supported by the record. Although one of the Rule's goals is to increase price competition, and,
in turn, reduce overall consumer expenditures, the Commission also intended the provision of itemized price information
to alert consumers to their various options and to permit them to select only those items they desire, whether or not
expenses would be reduced as a result.

148

 Lacking record evidence to support a change, consumers who inquire about providers' offerings, and not their prices,
should thus be entitled to receive a GPL. 




Third, the NFDA proposal that providers make the GPL available at the funeral arrangements conference before ``specific''
funeral goods and services are selected or prices discussed would remove the requirement that providers give the
list at the beginning of arrangements discussions, wherever they take place. Record evidence shows that consumers
benefit from price and service options information, including the GPL, that they receive early in selecting funeral
goods and services, and that at least some funeral arrangements, short of a formal ``arrangements conference,''
often can and do occur away from the funeral home premises.

149

 Other evidence discussed earlier demonstrated that consumers' knowledge generally about the funeral transaction,
although somewhat improved, is still relatively low. As a result of adopting the NFDA suggestion, consumers' opinions
about the overall type of funeral service or individual items could thus be formed, or actual selections made, without
the benefit of the GPL disclosures concerning prices, options and consumer rights under the Rule. In that event, the
preponderance of the record evidence supports the conclusion that the GPL's purpose to provide ready price and service
options information for consultation while consumers are considering what goods to purchase, before they make selections,
would be unnecessarily defeated.

Finally, the NFDA-NSM proposal that the GPL's ``give for retention'' requirement be changed so that only consumers
who request to keep the GPL may do so is not supported by the record. The evidence indicates that most consumers value
the GPL enough to keep it when it is offered for retention.

150

 The Commission might not disagree with the NFDA suggestion if there were evidence that consumers are aware of their
right under the Rule to retain the GPL. The record does not contain that evidence, however, and instead shows that consumers
generally are unaware of their rights under the Rule.

151

 There is no record basis from which to conclude, therefore, that consumers would think to ask to retain the GPL. Consumers,
as a result, would be denied the opportunity to use the GPL to comparison shop in at-need or pre-need situations,

152

 or to compare authorized selections with final funeral home charges. 






The Commission has amended  453.2(b)(4)(i) to effect two changes to its original, preventive requirements.
This amendment remedies providers' stated concerns about the timing of the GPL without limiting consumers' ability
to use the information provided by GPL disclosures effectively. First, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``timing''
requirements by breaking down the triggering term ``funeral arrangements'' into its component parts, namely, discussions
of prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific funeral goods or services. This change
should eliminate the apparent provider misinterpretation that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation
of preliminary arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. It clarifies, however,
that discussions about the overall type of service trigger the GPL requirement, and that providers must give the GPL
at the beginning of any discussion involving prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific
funeral goods or services.

153

 




Second, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``distribution'' requirement contained in an original compliance guidelines
interpretation that requires that providers must give consumers the GPL whether discussions occur in the funeral
home ``or elsewhere.'' Record evidence shows that arrangements may occur away from the funeral home premises. However,
the amendment exempts from the GPL requirement in-person provider requests for prior embalming authorization if
the provider makes essentially the same GPL disclosure required by  453.3(a)(1)(ii) of the Rule concerning
the legal necessity for embalming.

154

 




Record evidence indicates that providers often may be placed in the uncomfortable position of responding to consumers'
requests to discuss selections during removal of remains. If providers are willing to commit consumers to financial
obligations at that time by making arrangements, record evidence supports consumers' right to receive a GPL. Record
evidence also shows, however, that giving the GPL during removal may be awkward, offensive, and unnecessary if no
other arrangements discussions occur at that time. Such evidence further indicates that a provider's request for
prior embalming authorization, by itself, may be the most potentially offensive situation for both consumers and
funeral directors, because it is a request to perform an intrusive procedure so soon after the survivors' loss.

155

 




The original and amended Rule resolve this issue for embalming requests made over the telephone by not requiring any
disclosure in that case. But the original Rule required that the GPL must be given if the request is made in person.

156

 If no other selections are made when the provider seeks prior permission, arguably the most important information
consumers need to make an informed response at that time concerns whether embalming is necessary. The required disclosure
that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases should trigger that discussion if the consumer
so desires. The Rule's embalming provisions are predicated on that basis. The amendment simply substitutes the disclosure
of that information for the provision of the entire GPL, to reduce the burden on providers and consumers and to promote
compliance with the Rule. Under the amendment, providers would be in compliance if they either provided a GPL when
seeking prior permission, or made the required embalming disclosure.

5. Fees for Basic (Non-declinable) vs. Other Services 


Section 453.4(b) of the Rule imposes the general legal requirement that consumers' selection of funeral goods and
services be permitted on an itemized basis. However,  453.4(b)(2)(i)(A) permits an exception to that general
right to select. Under that provision, consumers may not decline the basic services of the funeral provider if the
provider so requires. The provision in that event further requires that providers place on the GPL the following statement:
``However, any funeral arrangements you select will include a charge for our services.'' Providers under  453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)
must also place the following disclosure on the GPL in conjunction with the price for the services of funeral director
and staff, if the fee cannot be declined: ``This fee for our services will be added to the total cost of the funeral arrangements
you select. (This fee is already included in our charge for direct cremations, immediate burials, and forwarding
or receiving remains.)'' 
The Commission, in promulgating that exception, reasoned that the process of selection itself involves use of the
provider's services, irrespective of the actual goods and services chosen by consumers. The Commission thus permitted
providers to make the services of the funeral provider non-declinable.

157

 




The Commission also intended that the non-declinable fee for professional services would include only the charge
for providers' basic services in arranging and planning the funeral, and not charges for services associated with
providing any of the other sixteen items for which itemization is required on the GPL.

158

 The Commission, for example, specifically used the term ``basic services'' in referring to those services that consumers
could not decline under  453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (the GPL service fee disclosure requirement).

159

 The definition in the original Rule itself stated that the services of funeral director and staff ``are the services,
not included in prices of other categories in  453.2(b)(4) which may be furnished by a funeral provider in arranging
and supervising a funeral, such as conducting the arrangements conference, planning the funeral, obtaining necessary
permits and placing obituary notices.''

160

 






The Commission, however, did not codify in the Rule its intent regarding basic services other than in the definition.
No substantive Rule provision thus clarifies that providers in disclosing itemized fees on the GPL must separate
``basic,'' non-declinable services from services associated with providing the other, declinable GPL goods and
services, including such items as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' and ``use of facilities for funeral ceremony.''
The original staff compliance guidelines for the Rule, as a result, contained lengthy interpretations of the Rule
on that issue, concluding that the non-declinable fee for ``services of funeral director and staff'' may not include
a charge for those services involved in providing any of the other items required to be separately listed on the GPL.
Charges for those services, the Guidelines stated, must be included in the price for each of those items. The Guidelines
further concluded that the non-declinable fee for services may include the services listed in the Rule's definition
of ``services of funeral director and staff.''

161

 




The only fee permitted by the Rule to be non-declinable at the outset of the funeral transaction is the charge for ``services
of funeral director and staff'' and items that are required by law.

162

 Several public hearing witnesses expressed their view, however, that the original disclosure requirement for the
non-declinable services fee permitted the inclusion of service items that all consumers do not receive with their
arrangements, so that consumers may be paying for services not received,

163

 or that the services fee should be broken down to separate fees for arranging all funerals and fees for optional services.

164

 These and other witnesses further suggested that consumers are unaware of that potential overpayment problem.

165

 







Still other witnesses identified another problem with the original services fee disclosure. Those participants
testified that, although consumers who ``shop'' among providers rely on quotes for service fees as a basis for comparison,
providers in fact appear to include different items in their service fee charges. Price comparison among funeral
homes is difficult as a result.

166

 The record contains no evidence or views specifically controverting this.

<PARENT> FR940111-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to these services fee difficulties, funeral provider groups asserted that the exclusion of a separate,
non-declinable ``basic facilities fee'' from the required GPL listing misinforms consumers about the cost of funeral
services.

167

 






Four witnesses expressed views on the facilities fee issue presented by the NFDA. The then-President of the NSM testified
that a non-declinable facilities fee is a legitimate charge to inform consumers that they are purchasing the use of
a facility to shelter and care for the remains.

168

 Similarly, Wendell Hahn of the FFDA asserted that providers' inclusion of the cost of providing a special-purpose
facility in other charges, rather than showing it separately, violates proper accounting practice and may be deceptive
pricing. Mr. Hahn concluded that the Rule should permit a separate basic facility charge that is non-declinable.

169

 Some funeral providers, in fact, currently include items on their GPLs that could be viewed as non-declinable facility
fees, such as fees for ``parking lot use.''

170

 








The Commission agrees that the original requirements for the disclosure of the non-declinable and other service
charges likely are causing compliance difficulties for some providers and informational problems for consumers.

The evidence indicates that some providers on their GPLs may not be fully separating non-declinable services from
services associated with providing other items on the GPL. To the extent that is occurring, consumers who decline
other items may be purchasing more services than they actually receive. Other consumers may be ``double charged''
for some services if providers, confused about which services are declinable and which are not, include some portion
of the services associated with declinable items, such as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' in that charge, as well
as the non-declinable services fee. Still other consumers (or groups such as memorial societies that obtain and publish
comparative price data) who attempt to comparison shop may not readily be able to do so. 


The Commission has concluded that the service disclosure requirements need to be clarified to implement fully the
Commission's intent in permitting a non-declinable services fee. Amendment of the Rule, however, to permit a non-declinable
``basic facilities fee'' charge is not warranted by the evidence or the original Rule requirements. The Rule's core
purpose is to permit itemization so that consumers may select only the funeral items they desire, and decline unwanted
items. The Rule allows providers to recover overhead for facilities by allocating a portion of those costs to each
item offered or by including them in the non-declinable services fee. A second, non-declinable fee would signal a
return to package pricing, where all consumers would pay for the use of all facilities (and, presumably, other overhead
costs) irrespective of the degree to which consumers choose to use them. Itemization permits consumers to decline
the use of various provider facilities. The testimony of at least one funeral director suggested, however, that some
providers currently may be imposing in some form a ``non-declinable'' facilities fee on consumers, in apparent violation
of the Rule. 


Accordingly, the Commission has adopted the following amendments to clarify the Rule's intent and requirements
with respect to service fees and non-declinable charges: 


(1) Revision of the ``services of funeral director and staff'' definition in  453.1(o) to clarify that these
are the basic services that cannot be included in prices of other, declinable GPL categories, and that are furnished
by a funeral provider in arranging any funeral, such as conducting the arrangements conference, planning the funeral,
obtaining necessary permits, and placing obituary notices; 


(2) Addition of the term ``basic'' before the word ``services'' where the latter term appears in   453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)
(1) and (2) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A), so that all GPL disclosures regarding the non-declinable services fee refer to
``basic services'' rather than simply ``services''; 


(3) Addition of the phrase ``and staff'' after the phrase ``use of facilities'' to   453.2(b)(4) (H) and
(I), to clarify that providers are required to disclose the prices for use of facilities and the services of staff associated
with viewing and a funeral ceremony; 

(4) Replacement of the ``other use of facilities'' price disclosure requirement,  453.2(b)(4)(J), with the
more specific disclosures ``use of facilities and staff for memorial service'' and ``use of equipment and staff for
graveside service''; 


(5) Addition to  453.1 of the definitions of a ``memorial service'' and a ``funeral ceremony'' to distinguish
those services for purposes of listing them separately on the GPL; 


(6) Addition of the express requirement to the disclosure requirements of   453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (1)
and (2) that, if the services fee cannot be declined, it must include all charges for the recovery of unallocated funeral
provider overhead, and funeral providers may include in the required disclosure (and in the GPL disclosure required
by 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A)) the phrase ``and overhead'' after the word ``services,'' so that disclosures regarding non-declinable
services fees refer to ``basic services,'' and to ``basic services and overhead,'' if providers wish; and 


(7) Addition of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) to  453.2 to make clear that the Rule permits only one non-declinable fee
for services, facilities or unallocated overhead, unless otherwise required by law. 


These amendments clarify the Commission's intent and providers' obligations in distinguishing non-declinable
service fees from other service charges associated with providing separately listed, declinable goods and services.
The changes are designed to promote industry compliance and consumer understanding of the services they must purchase
and those they may decline, without substantially altering providers' obligations. The amendment permitting providers
to add the phrase ``and overhead'' to the non-declinable service fee disclosure responds to industry's stated concern
that consumers may be deceived by service fee price disclosures that fail to disclose a charge for overhead,

171

 and clarifies for providers that the non-declinable fee can include overhead not allocated to other charges. 






The Commission further has determined, to reduce stated and potential GPL compliance burdens, to: (1) remove ``other
automotive equipment'' (flower car/family car)

172

 and ``acknowledgment cards''

173

 from the required GPL listing; (2) delete as unnecessary the required GPL disclosure that the GPL does not include
cash advance items,  453.2(b)(4)(i)(D), and move from the GPL to the statement of goods and services selected
the cash advance mark-up disclosure required by  453.3(f)(2);

174

 (3) decline to adopt the required use of a ``standardized general price list,'' which the Commission finds is unnecessary
in light of the relatively standardized GPL the Rule now requires, and the amendment, discussed below, prohibiting
any language in any of the Rule-required price lists that alters or contradicts the information provided therein.

6. Misrepresentation/Disclosure Provisions 




Section 453.3 of the Rule currently requires funeral providers to make specific written disclosures on the price
lists and the itemized statement of goods and services selected. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and
Purpose determined that, due to funeral providers' false claims or failure to disclose accurate information, many
consumers erroneously believed that certain procedures (such as embalming) or particular goods (such as caskets
for cremation and outer burial containers) were required purchases not subject to individual choice, and that goods
and services had certain protective and preservative qualities when such was not the case.

176

 






Section 453.3 thus declares that it is a deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to misrepresent: embalming
requirements, casket for cremation requirements,

177

 outer burial container requirements, legal and cemetery requirements, preservative and protective value of funeral
goods and services, and cash advance charges. The provisions of  453.3 were designed to prevent those deceptive
practices and to correct consumers' misconceptions by requiring written disclosures on both the price lists and
the itemized statement. 




Funeral provider groups recommended that the twelve affirmative disclosure requirements be deleted, or, in the
alternative, that the Rule permit providers to use their own disclosure language.

178

 The Commission has determined, however, that the record does not provide a substantial basis to repeal the twelve
affirmative disclosures. Although the empirical data indicate that consumers' knowledge has increased somewhat
under the Rule, and that some misrepresentations have declined, the data also show that misrepresentations are still
occurring, particularly in areas where consumer knowledge is still low, such as embalming. The evidence further
demonstrates that consumer knowledge of funeral requirements and products is still at a minimal level. Viewed together,
those facts warrant the retention of the disclosure provisions.

179

 Nor is there sufficient evidence to warrant an amendment allowing funeral providers to use their own disclosure language.
That change would make it more difficult to monitor compliance, whereas the required, standardized language ensures
that all consumers are receiving identical information. 









The Commission agrees, however, that the language of several of the disclosures has created some potential compliance
problems for funeral providers. The Commission therefore has adopted the following changes to the embalming, casket
for cremation, outer burial container, and cash advance disclosure provisions in order to clarify the Rule's scope
and requirements, and to reduce potential disclosure burdens: 


(1) Deletion of the portion of  453.3(a)(2)(i) that prohibits representations that embalming is required
for a funeral using a sealed casket; substantial evidence indicates that, because sealed (i.e., ``gasketed'') caskets
cannot prevent the escape of gases any more than other caskets, embalming may be necessary for a funeral service using
a sealed casket where refrigeration is not available;

180

 






(2) Amendment of the deceptive acts or practices definition concerning the necessity for embalming,  453.3(a)(1)(ii),
to include the modifying phrase ``if any'' after the phrase ``except in certain special cases,'' and amendment of
the GPL disclosure required by  453.3(a)(2)(ii) to permit providers to delete from the disclosure that embalming
is not required by law the phrase ``except in certain special cases,'' if state or local law in the areas where the provider
does business does not require embalming under any circumstances. These changes are appropriate to reduce compliance
burdens and accommodate the situation where state laws do not require embalming under any conditions;

181

 






(3) Amendment of the GPL alternative container disclosure required by  453.3(b)(2) to: (a) Delete the required
references to: (i) An ``unfinished wood box,'' in addition to references to an ``alternative container,'' because
the former in today's market is considered a type of alternative container, and (ii) ``pouches of canvas,'' which
is not a type of container generally available and accepted by crematories; (b) include the phrase ``encase the body''
after ``Alternative containers;'' (c) include the statement ``The containers we provide are (specify containers).'';
and 
(d) substitute ``fiberboard'' for ``heavy cardboard'' to conform to market terminology.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940111-0-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These amendments
 more accurately describe the purpose of alternative containers and reduce any potential for confusion and misrepresentation
concerning the types of containers that are available for use in cremations;
 





(4) Amendment of the OBC-PL disclosure required by  453.3(c)(2) to permit providers in disclosing that
grave liners or vaults are not required by law to delete the phrase ``in most areas of the country,'' to accommodate
situations where state and local laws do not require outer burial containers;
 and 




(5) Amendment of the substance of the cash advance mark-up disclosure, required by  453.3(f)(2), to require
only that providers specify those cash advance items for which the provider charges a mark-up. The Commission has
determined that the original disclosure may have caused the misimpression that providers markup all cash advance
items, because it broadly referred to all cash advance items, when that is not the case.
 




7. Other Minor/Technical Amendments 


The Commission has made a slight modification to  453.4(b)(2)(i)(B), a provision designed to enforce the Rule's
unbundling provisions. The purpose for this provision was to inform consumers, before they sign the funeral contract,
that they may only be charged for those items selected or for items that are required by law. If purchases are required
by law or otherwise, this provision further provides consumers with an explanation in writing, together with the
reason the requirement applies to their selections. The provision was intended to provide consumers with a final
reminder that they need only pay for items that they have selected.
 




The Commission has amended the required language in order to clarify for consumers the original purpose of the provision.
It alerts consumers that they may only be charged for the goods and services that they choose, or that are required by
law or by a cemetery or crematory (such as an outer burial container or a certain type of alternative container).
 




The Commission further adopts a technical change to  453.6 concerning providers' retention of documents,
to clarify its requirements. The original section required the funeral provider to retain a copy of the ``signed''
statement of goods and services selected. The Rule, however, does not contain any express requirement that the final
statement be signed, either by the consumer or the provider. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose
made no mention of the signature requirement. Earlier drafts of the Rule included a requirement that the funeral provider
ask the consumer to sign the itemized statement, but it was not adopted in the final version. The ``signed'' language
of  453.6 was apparently inserted to complement the earlier draft of the Rule that contained the itemized statement
requirement; however, when the signature requirement was deleted, the language of  453.6 was inadvertently
left intact. This language, however, is susceptible to different interpretations, and may lead some funeral providers
to believe that they must obtain the signature of the consumer on the statement. 
The Commission therefore has amended the language of  453.6 by deleting the phrase ``on which the statement
was signed,'' and substituting the phrase ``of the arrangements conference,'' so that the provision now requires
providers to maintain a copy of each statement of funeral goods and services selected ``for at least one year from the
date of the arrangements conference.''
 




The Commission, in addition, has added clarifying language to the required ``clear and conspicuous'' disclosure
standard contained in  453.7 of the Rule. That language clarifies that providers may not add statements or information
to the Rule-required price lists that alter or contradict the information required to be included in those lists.

This specific prohibition is necessary to prevent violations of the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard that relate
to provider detraction and potential consumer confusion problems demonstrated in the record.
 




Finally, the Commission has: 
(1) Deleted the definition of ``Accounting year'' ( 453.1(a)), because that phrase does not appear elsewhere
in the Rule; 
(2) amended the definition of a ``casket'' ( 453.1(d)), to include those constructed of ``fiberglass'' and
``plastic'', because those types of caskets represent a significant portion of caskets produced in today's market;
 and 




(3) made a slight grammatical change to the definition of ``Funeral services'' ( 453.1(j)), to make it clear
that the Rule only covers services that involve both the preparation of remains and the supervision of disposition.

III. Other Matters 


A. Final Regulatory and Regulatory Flexibility Analyses 


The Commission has determined that these amendments to the Funeral Rule will not have an annual effect on the national
economy of $100 million or more, or otherwise have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business.
The preponderance of the evidence in the record indicates that the Rule overall has not significantly increased funeral
providers' costs of doing business, and that the amendments will reduce any costs to providers imposed by the Rule's
requirements, by making it easier for them to comply. Therefore, pursuant to the exception for Rule amendments contained
in section 22(a)(1)(A) of the FTC Act, and the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604, 605, section

 453.2


Price Disclosures.



(a) 

Unfair or deceptive acts or practices. 

In selling or offering to sell funeral goods or funeral services to the public, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice
for a funeral provider to fail to furnish accurate price information disclosing the cost to the purchaser for each
of the specific funeral goods and funeral services used in connection with the disposition of deceased human bodies,
including at least the price of embalming, transportation of remains, use of facilities, caskets, outer burial containers,
immediate burials, or direct cremations, to persons inquiring about the purchase of funerals. Any funeral provider
who complies with the preventive requirements in paragraph (b) of this section is not engaged in the unfair or deceptive
acts or practices defined here. 

(b) 

Preventive requirements. 

To prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as well as the unfair or deceptive acts or practices defined
in  453.4(b)(1), funeral providers must: 

(1) 

Telephone price disclosure. 

Tell persons who ask by telephone about the funeral provider's offerings or prices any accurate information from
the price lists described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section and any other readily available information
that reasonably answers the question. 

(2) 

Casket price list.

 (i) Give a printed or typewritten price list to people who inquire in person about the offerings or prices of caskets
or alternative containers. The funeral provider must offer the list upon beginning discussion of, but in any event
before showing caskets. The list must contain at least the retail prices of all caskets and alternative containers
offered which do not require special ordering, enough information to identify each, and the effective date for the
price list. In lieu of a written list, other formats, such as notebooks, brochures, or charts may be used if they contain
the same information as would the printed or typewritten list, and display it in a clear and conspicuous manner. Provided,
however, that funeral providers do not have to make a casket price list available if the funeral providers place on
the general price list, specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the information required by this paragraph.


(ii) Place on the list, however produced, the name of the funeral provider's place of business and a caption describing
the list as a ``casket price list.'' 

(3) 

Outer burial container price list. 

(i) Give a printed or typewritten price list to persons who inquire in person about outer burial container offerings
or prices. The funeral provider must offer the list upon beginning discussion of, but in any event before showing the
containers. The list must contain at least the retail prices of all outer burial containers offered which do not require
special ordering, enough information to identify each container, and the effective date for the prices listed. In
lieu of a written list, the funeral provider may use other formats, such as notebooks, brochures, or charts, if they
contain the same information as the printed or typewritten list, and display it in a clear and conspicuous manner.
Provided, however, that funeral providers do not have to make an outer burial container price list available if the
funeral providers place on the general price list, specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the information
required by this paragraph. 

(ii) Place on the list, however produced, the name of the funeral provider's place of business and a caption describing
the list as an ``outer burial container price list.'' 

(4) 

General price list. 

(i)(A) Give a printed or typewritten price list for retention to persons who inquire in person about the funeral goods,
funeral services or prices of funeral goods or services offered by the funeral provider. The funeral provider must
give the list upon beginning discussion of any of the following: 



(1) 

The prices of funeral goods or funeral services; 



(2) 

The overall type of funeral service or disposition; or 



(3) 

Specific funeral goods or funeral services offered by the funeral provider. 

(B) The requirement in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section applies whether the discussion takes place in the funeral
home or elsewhere. Provided, however, that when the deceased is removed for transportation to the funeral home, an
in-person request at that time for authorization to embalm, required by  453.5(a)(2), does not, by itself,
trigger the requirement to offer the general price list if the provider in seeking prior embalming approval discloses
that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases, if any. Any other discussion during that time
about prices or the selection of funeral goods or services triggers the requirement under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)
of this section to give consumers a general price list.

(C) The list required in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section must contain at least the following information:




(1) 

The name, address, and telephone number of the funeral provider's place of business; 



(2) 

A caption describing the list as a ``general price list''; and 



(3) 

The effective date for the price list; 

(ii) Include on the price list, in any order, the retail prices (expressed either as the flat fee, or as the price per
hour, mile or other unit of computation) and the other information specified below for at least each of the following
items, if offered for sale: 

(A) Forwarding of remains to another funeral home, together with a list of the services provided for any quoted price;


(B) Receiving remains from another funeral home, together with a list of the services provided for any quoted price;


(C) The price range for the direct cremations offered by the funeral provider, together with:



(1)

 A separate price for a direct cremation where the purchaser provides the container;



(2) 

Separate prices for each direct cremation offered including an alternative container; and



(3) 

A description of the services and container (where applicable), included in each price; 

(D) The price range for the immediate burials offered by the funeral provider, together with:



(1) 

A separate price for an immediate burial where the purchaser provides the casket;



(2) 

Separate prices for each immediate burial offered including a casket or alternative container; and



(3) 

A description of the services and container (where applicable) included in that price;

our basic services will be added to the total cost of the funeral arrangements you select. (This fee is already included
in our charges for direct cremations, immediate burials, and forwarding or receiving remains.)''. If the charge
cannot be declined by the purchaser, the quoted price shall include all charges for the recovery of unallocated funeral
provider overhead, and funeral providers may include in the required disclosure the phrase ``and overhead'' after
the word ``services''; or 



(2) 

The following statement: ``Please note that a fee of (

specify dollar amount

of your funeral arrangements if you provide the casket. Our services include (specify).'' The fee shall include all

human remains, at the conclusion of the discussion of arrangements. The statement must list at least the following
information:

(B) Specifically itemized cash advance items. (These prices must be given to the extent then known or reasonably ascertainable.
If the prices are not known or reasonably ascertainable, a good faith estimate shall be given and a written statement
