Redelegation of Authority To Approve Releases of Liability in Connection With Voluntary Liquidations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Farmers Home Administration, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of redelegation of authority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 11, 1992, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) redelegated certain authorities to all State Directors
dealing with the settlement of and/or the release of liability on FmHA debts owed by borrowers who made application
to settle their FmHA debts or request release of liability. Notice of this redelegation was published in 57 FR 43688
(September 22, 1992). The redelegation authority, granted on September 11, 1992, expired on September 30, 1993,
and the Administrator now gives notice to extend that redelegation until December 31, 1994. All release of liability
cases of $1,000,000 or more (including principal, interest and other charges) must be submitted to the National Office
for approval by the Administrator. This action is taken to expedite the processing of requests of borrowers who are
unable to repay all of their FmHA debts.



The effect of the extension of the redelegation of the Administrator's authority is to continue to expedite the administrative
review process for releases of liability, permitting more timely debt relief to FmHA borrowers, and to consequently
reduce the Agency's portfolio of inactive uncollectible accounts.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Programs Affected



This action affects the following FmHA programs as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance:





10.404 Emergency Loans.

10.406 Farm Operating Loans.

10.407 Farm Ownership Loans.

10.410 Low-Income Housing Loans.

10.416 Soil and Water Loans.

10.417 Very Low-Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants.

10.428 Economic Emergency Loans.





The notice of the delegation of authority for approving release of liability cases reads as follows:

This extends the authority to approve Release of Liability cases given under the unnumbered memorandum dated September
11, 1992, entitled ``Extension of the Delegation of Authority for Approving Debt Settlement/Release of Liability
Cases.'' You were given authority to approve debt settlement cases of less $1,000,000 in FmHA Instruction 1956-B,
Section 1956.84(a) on April 21, 1993, under Procedure Notice Number 204.

Pursuant to authority delegated to me as Administrator of Farmers Home Administration, I hereby redelegate to State
Directors authority to approve the following:

1. Release of Lability cases in accordance with Sections 1955.10(f)(2) and 1955.20(b)(2) of FmHA Instruction 1955-A,
``Liquidation of Loans Secured by Real Estate and Acquisition of Real and Chattel Property.''

2. Release of Liability cases in accordance with Section 1962.34(h) of FmHA Instruction 1962-A, ``Servicing
and Liquidation of Chattel Security,'' and Sections 1965.26(f)(5)(ii) and 1965.27(f) of FmHA Instruction 1965-A,
``Servicing of Real Estate Security for Farmer Programs Loans and Certain Note Only Cases.''

This authority does not extend to Release of Liability cases for Nonprogram loans, Economic Opportunity loans, and
claims against third party converters.

Cases where the borrower's total indebtedness, including principal, interest, and other charges, is $1,000,000
or more must be submitted to the National Office for approval by the Administrator.

This extension of the redelegation shall be effective through December 31, 1994, unless revoked or otherwise modified
in writing. The authority delegated to the State Director cannot be further delegated.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 140-1


(Date)


Announcing the Standard for Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules


Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.
1. 

Name of Standard.

 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (FIPS PUB 140-1).
2. 

Category of Standard.

 Computer Security.
3. 

Explanation.

 This standard specifies the security requirements that are to be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within
a security system protecting unclassified information within computer and telecommunication systems (including
voice systems). The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3,
and Level 4. These levels are intended to cover the wide range of potential applications and environments in which
cryptographic modules may be employed. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation
of a cryptographic module. These areas include basic design and documentation, module interfaces, authorized roles
and services, physical security, software security, operating system security, key management, cryptographic
algorithms, electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC), and self-testing. This
standard supersedes FIPS 140, General Security Requirements for Equipment Using the Data Encryption Standard,
in its entirety.

List 91) of currently available computer security publications, including ordering information, can be obtained
from NIST.

7. Applicability. 

This standard is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect unclassified
information within computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) that are not subject to Section
2315 of Title 10, U.S. Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. This standard shall be used in designing, acquiring
and implementing cryptographic-based security systems within computer and telecommunication systems (including
voice systems), operated by a Federal agency or by a contractor of a Federal agency or other organization that processes
information (using a computer or telecommunications system) on behalf of the Federal Government to accomplish a
Federal function. Federal agencies which use cryptographic-based security systems for protecting classified
information may use those systems for protecting unclassified information in lieu of systems that comply with this
standard. Non-Federal government organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard when it provides the
desired security for protecting valuable or sensitive information.

8. 

Applications. 

Cryptographic-based security systems may be utilized in various computer and telecommunication (including voice)
applications (e.g., data storage, access control and personal identification, radio, facsimile, video) and in
various environments (e.g., centralized computer facilities, office environments, hostile environments). The
cryptographic services (e.g., encryption, authentication, digital signature, key management) provided by a cryptographic
module will be based on many factors which are specific to the application and environment. The security level of a
cryptographic module shall be chosen to provide a level of security appropriate for the security requirements of
the application and environment in which the module is to be utilized and the security services which the module is
to provide. The security requirements for a particular security level include both the security requirements specific
to that level and the security requirements that apply to all modules regardless of the level. System characteristics
not related to security (e.g., telecommunications interoperability) are beyond the scope of this standard.

9. 

Specifications. 

Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-1, 

Security Requirements for Cryptographic Module 

(affixed).

10. 

Implementations. 

This standard covers implementations of cryptographic modules including, but not limited to, hardware components
or modules, software programs or modules, computer firmware, or any combination thereof. Cryptographic modules
that are validated by NIST, or that comply with the requirements of the FIPS 140-1 implementation and FIPS 140
acquisition schedules in Section 14 of the announcement of this standard, will be considered as complying with this
standard. Information about the FIPS 140-1 validation program can be obtained from the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

11. 

FIPS Approved Security Methods. 

Cryptographic modules that comply with this standard shall employ cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic key
generation algorithms and key distribution techniques, and authentication techniques that have been FIPS approved
for protecting Federal Government unclassified information. FIPS approved cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic
key generation algorithms and key distribution techniques, and authentication techniques include those that are
either:

a. Specified in a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), or

b. Adopted in a FIPS and specified either in an appendix to the FIPS or in a document referenced by the FIPS.

If a cryptographic module is required to incorporate a trusted operating system, then the module shall employ trusted
operating systems that have been evaluated by a NIST accredited evaluation authority and against a FIPS approved
evaluation criteria.

Information about approved cryptographic methods and approved operating system evaluation authorities and criteria
can be obtained from NIST.

12. 

Interpretation. 

Resolution of questions regarding this standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the content and specifications
should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: FIPS 140-1 Interpretation, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

13. 

Export Control. 

Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are deemed to be defense articles (i.e., inherently
military in character) and are subject to Federal government export controls as specified in Title 22, Code of Federal
Regulations, parts 120-128. Some exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical
data regarding them must comply with these Federal regulations and be licensed by the U.S. Department of State. Other
exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them fall under the licensing
authority of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce is
responsible for licensing cryptographic devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary software,
automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment and software. For advice concerning
which agency has licensing authority for a particular cryptographic device, please contact the respective agencies.







14. 

Implementation Schedule. 

Table 1 summarizes the implementation schedule for FIPS 140-1. The effective date of this standard is June 30,
1994.

From approval of FIPS 140-1 to its effective date, agencies may purchase equipment with FIPS 140-1 cryptographic
modules that have been affirmed in writing from the manufacturer as complying with this standard. From June 30, 1994
until six months after the establishment of the FIPS 140-1 validation program by NIST, agencies that have determined
a need for equipment with cryptographic modules shall purchase equipment with FIPS 140-1 cryptographic modules
that have been affirmed in writing by the manufacturer as complying with this standard. A copy of the written affirmation
shall have been sent to the Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

<TEXT>
 




For a one year period following the six months after the establishment of the FIPS 140-1 validation program,
agencies shall purchase either equipment with validated FIPS 140-1 cryptographic modules, or equipment whose
cryptographic modules have been submitted for FIPS 140-1 validation. After this period, only FIPS 140-1
validated cryptographic modules will be considered as meeting the provisions of this standard. 

Table 2 summarizes the schedule for acquisition of FIPS 140 compliant equipment. For up to three years following June
30, 1994, equipment with cryptographic modules complying to FIPS 140, General Security Requirements for Equipment
Using the Data Encryption Standard (formerly Federal Standard 1027), may be purchased in lieu of equipment with modules
that comply with this standard. These modules either shall have been endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA)
as complying to Federal Standard 1027, or shall be affirmed in writing by the manufacturer as complying to FIPS 140.
NSA endorsed modules shall have been endorsed prior to December, 1993. A list of endorsed products (NSA Endorsed Data
Encryption Standard (DES) Products List) is available from the NSA. For modules affirmed by the manufacturer as complying
with FIPS 140, a copy of the written affirmation shall have been sent by the manufacturer to the Director of the Computer
Systems Laboratory at NIST prior to June 30, 1994. A list of these methods is available from NIST. 

Equipment purchased under the above conditions may continue to be used for the lifetime of the equipment without the
need for further affirmation or validation for conformance to this standard. 

15. 

Qualifications. 

The security requirements specified in this standard are based upon information provided by many sources within
the Federal government and private industry. The requirements are designed to protect against adversaries mounting
cost-effective attacks on unclassified government or commercial data (e.g., hackers, organized crime, economic
competitors). The primary goal in designing an effective security system is to make the cost of any attack greater
than the possible payoff. 

While the security requirements specified in this standard are intended to maintain the security of a cryptographic
module, conformance to this standard does not guarantee that a particular module is secure. It is the responsibility
of the manufacturer of a cryptographic module to build the module in a secure manner. 

Similarly, the use of a cryptographic module that conforms to this standard in an overall system does not guarantee
the security of the overall system. The responsible authority in each agency shall assure that an overall system provides
an acceptable level of security. 

Since a standard of this nature must be flexible enough to adapt to advancements and innovations in science and technology,
this standard will be reviewed every 5 years in order to consider new or revised requirements that may be needed to meet
technological and economic changes. 

16. 

Waiver Procedure. 

Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated
pursuant to Section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when: 

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or 

b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings. 

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B-154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 

In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. 

When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.


A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under Section 552(b) of Title 5, U.S.
Code, shall be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency. 

17.

<DOCTITLE>Trilateral Cross-Margining Program Among the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </DOCTITLE>
the Intermarket Clearing Corporation, and the Options Clearing Corporation 



The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') have submitted to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C.  7a(a)(12)(A), and Commission Regulation 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b), a proposal
to implement a trilateral cross-margining program with the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') (CME, ICC, and
OCC together being the ``participating clearing organizations). The CME-ICC-OCC program would involve
the cross-margining of positions in specified commodity futures, commodity options, and securities options (``eligible
contracts'') carried for, among others, certain market professional customers. These market professionals would
include CME members and firms owning CME memberships, members of exchanges cleared by ICC, and market makers, specialists,
and registered traders on securities options markets whose accounts would not be proprietary within the meaning
of Commission Regulation 1.3(y), 17 CFR 1.3(y), (``participating market professionals'') and whose positions
are carried by participating futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') that also are participating broker-dealers
(``B/Ds'') or by participating FCMs and their affiliated participating B/Ds which may also be FCMs (together ``participating
clearing firms''). 

Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act provides that the Commission shall approve contract market rules only if such rules
``are determined by the Commission not to be in violation of [the] Act or the regulations of the Commission.'' Commingling
of futures and non-futures funds of customers currently is not permitted under the Commission's regulations. Section
4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  6d(2), however, authorizes the Commission to issue an order prescribing the terms
and conditions under which ``money, securities, and property (received by an FCM to margin, guarantee or secure the
commodity futures trades or contracts of a customer) may be commingled * * * with any other money, securities,
and property received by such [FCM] and required by the Commission to be separately accounted for and treated and dealt
with as belonging to the customers of such [FCM].'' Accordingly, any proposal which would permit such commingling
would require Commission action pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act, as well as Section 5a(a)(12)(A). 



Whereas, 

the CME-ICC-OCC non-proprietary cross-margining proposal provides for calculation by the participating
clearing organizations of a single margin requirement to support the positions of participating market professionals
in eligible contracts carried by participating clearing firms; 



Whereas, 

the Commission has reviewed the CME-ICC-OCC cross-margining proposal; new ICC rules 514, 515, 516, 517,
518, 519, and 520; proposed amendments to ICC Rules 101, 301, 302, 513 and 614; the proposed agreement among the participating
clearing organizations; the proposed agreements among the participating clearing firms and the participating
clearing organizations; and the proposed agreements among the participating market professionals and participating
clearing firms submitted by letters dated September 21, 1992 through April 22, 1993; the representations of the participating
clearing organizations as to the operation of the program; the representations of the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (``SIPC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''); and such other documents as constitute
the complete record in this matter (``Record''); 



Whereas, 

the agreements among participating market professionals, participating clearing firms, and participating clearing
organizations require that: 

(a) Each participating market professional acknowledge in writing that any money, securities or property, including
securities option positions, held on his behalf in a non-proprietary cross-margining account (``cross-margining
property'') will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms of this Order and any other applicable order issued
by the Commission; 

(b) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that any cross-margining property
held on his behalf by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM will be customer
property deemed to be received by the participating FCM to be accounted for, treated, and dealt with by such FCM as belonging
to such market professional in a manner consistent with Section 4d of the Act;

(c) Each participating market professional agree in writing that, in the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, or
receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution of funds held by a participating clearing firm against
which such market professional has a customer net equity claim in respect of the cross-margining property, such claim
shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission
Regulation 190.01(hh), 17 CFR 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate to money, securities, or property
in any cross-margining account; and 

(d) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that cross-margining property held
for or on his behalf will not be customer property under the Federal securities laws to the extent necessary to effect
this Order and will not be customer property under Subchapter III of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11
U.S.C.   741-752 or the Securities Investor Protection Act (``SIPA''), 15 U.S.C.  78aaa


et seq.,

 and will not be claimed as such, and will be customer property under the Act, Subchapter IV of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 761-766, and part 190 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR part 190; 



Whereas, 

each participating market professional which signs such a participant agreement will be a customer of a participating
FCM; 



Whereas,

 each participating clearing firm will treat money, securities, and property received in respect of all accounts
other than cross-margining accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Commission and the SEC appropriate
thereto; 



Whereas,

 SIPC has represented that it has no objection to the agreements under which a participating market professional's
cross-margining property would not be deemed to be customer property for the purposes of SIPA; and 



Whereas, 

the SEC has concurred with the treatment of securities positions and cross-margining accounts set forth in this Order;


Now Therefore, based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the cross-margining proposal submitted by CME
and ICC and related proposed rules and rule amendments submitted by ICC are implemented consistently with the representations
and agreements cited herein, and provided that: 

(a) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and participating market professional
execute the agreements referred to herein; 

(b) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and depository separately account
for cross-margining property maintained in non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and not commingle such cross-margining
property with money, securities, and property maintained in any non-cross-margining accounts or proprietary cross-margining
accounts; 

(c) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, participating market professional,
and depository provide the Commission with access to its books and records with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining
accounts and positions in a manner consistent with Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31; 

(d) Each participating clearing firm include all cross-margining property received from participating market
professionals as provided herein to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts,
commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, or accruing to such participating market professionals
as a result of such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions or securities option transactions, when calculating
segregation requirements for the purposes of Section 4d of the Act; 

(e) Each participating clearing firm compute total segregation requirements under Section 4d of the Act and Commission
Regulation 1.32, 17 CFR 1.32, by calculating separately the requirements for cross-margining and non-cross-margining
accounts without using any net liquidating equity in one account to reduce a deficit in the other; 

(f) Each participating clearing firm designate non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and positions as such
in its books and records, including both internal documents maintained at the firms and account statements sent to
participating market professionals; 

(g) Each participating clearing organization calculate the margin requirements for each non-proprietary cross-margining
account separately from the margin requirements for other accounts, including proprietary cross-margining accounts;
collect any margin required with respect to non-proprietary cross margining accounts separately without applying
any margin in any such account to satisfy a margin requirement in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account and without applying any margin in a non-cross-margining customer account to satisfy a margin requirement
in any proprietary account or any non-proprietary cross-margining account; and maintain all cross-margining property
received from participating clearing firms to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity
futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for non-proprietary
cross-margining accounts or held in such accounts, and all accruals resulting from such trades, contracts, commodity
option transactions, or securities option transactions, separately from money, securities, and property received
to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions,
or securities option transactions that are effected for or held in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account, and related accruals; and 

(h) Each participating clearing organization satisfy any deficiency in a non-proprietary cross-margining account
without recourse to non-cross-margining segregated funds; 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating clearing firm may commingle cross-margining property maintained
in respect of the non-proprietary cross-margining arrangement among CME, ICC, and OCC with money, securities and
property maintained in respect of similar Commission-approved non-proprietary cross-margining arrangements
between CME and other commodity clearing organizations, between ICC and other commodity clearing organizations,
or between OCC and other commodity clearing organizations, and may apply such commingled money, securities, and
property to meet its obligations to a commodity or option clearing organization arising from trades or positions
held in its non-proprietary cross-margining account established pursuant to one or more of such cross-margining
arrangements, provided that the participating clearing firm:

 


(i) Separately identify and account for the money, securities and property held pursuant to each of the non-proprietary
cross-margining arrangements; and 

(ii) separately calculate the margin requirements with respect to each of the non-proprietary-cross-margining
arrangements, treating each position as being held pursuant to only one such arrangement;






It Is Hereby Ordered

 pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act: 

(1) That all money, securities, and property received by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with
a participating FCM to margin, guarantee, or secure securities option trades or contracts carried in a non-proprietary-cross-margining
account for or on behalf of participating market professionals, or accruing as a result of such trades or contracts,
and held subject to the terms of this Order, shall be deemed to have been received by the participating FCM and shall
be accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the participating market professional customers of the
participating FCM consistently with Section 4d of the Act;

(including, but not limited to, Regulations 1.20(a), 1.22, and 1.24, 17 CFR 1.20(a), 1.22, and 1.24), the money, securities,

or positions in eligible commodity futures or commodity option contracts, or accruing as a result of such trades or
contracts, and otherwise required by the Commission to be segregated under the Act; and 
(3) That, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution
of funds held by a participating clearing firm, any customer net equity claim which a participating market professional
has in respect of cross-margining property held by such participating clearing firm in a non-proprietary cross-margining
account shall be treated as a customer net equity claim, under Part 190 of the Commission's regulations and Subchapter

<DOCTITLE>Trilateral Cross-Margining Program Among the Commodity Clearing Corp., the Intermarket Clearing Corp., and the
Options Clearing Corp.</DOCTITLE>


The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') and the Commodity Clearing Corporation (``CCC'') have submitted
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C. 7a(a)(12)(A), and Commission Regulation 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b), a proposal to
implement a trilateral cross-margining program with The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') (CCC, ICC, and
OCC together being the ``participating clearing organizations''). The CCC-ICC-OCC program would involve
the cross-margining of positions in specified commodity futures, commodity options, and securities options (``eligible
contracts'') carried for, among others, certain market professional customers. These market professionals would
include New York Cotton Exchange (``NYCE'') or FINEX members and firms owning NYCE or FINEX memberships, members
of exchanges cleared by ICC, and market makers, specialists, and registered traders on securities options markets
whose accounts would not be proprietary within the meaning of Commission Regulation 1.3(y), 17 CFR 1.3(y), (``participating
market professionals'') and whose positions are carried by participating futures commission merchants (``FCMs'')
that also are participating broker-dealers (``B/Ds'') or by participating FCMs and their affiliated participating
B/Ds which may also be FCMs (together ``participating clearing firms''). Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act provides
that the Commission shall approve contract market rules only if such rules ``are determined by the Commission not
to be in violation of [the] Act or the regulations of the Commission.'' Commingling of futures and non-futures funds
of customers currently is not permitted under the Commission's regulations. Section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d(2),
however, authorizes the Commission to issue an order prescribing the terms and conditions under which ``money, securities,
and property [received by an FCM to margin, guarantee or secure the commodity futures trades or contracts of a customer]
may be commingled * * * with any other money, securities, and property received by such [FCM] and required
by the Commission to be separately accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the customers of such [FCM].''
Accordingly, any proposal which would permit such commingling would require Commission action pursuant to section
4d(2) of the Act, as well as section 5a(a)(12)(A). 
Whereas, the CCC-ICC-OCC non-proprietary cross-margining proposal provides for calculation by the
participating clearing organizations of a single margin requirement to support the positions of participating
market professionals in eligible contracts carried by participating clearing firms; 
Whereas, the Commission has reviewed the CCC-ICC-OCC cross-margining proposal; the proposed agreement
among the participating clearing organizations; the proposed agreements among the participating clearing firms
and the participating clearing organizations; and the proposed agreements among the participating market professionals
and participating clearing firms submitted by letters dated April 7 through November 16, 1993; the representations
of the participating clearing organizations as to the operation of the program; the representations of the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''); and such other
documents as constitute the complete record in this matter (``Record''); 
Whereas, the agreements among participating market professionals, participating clearing firms, and participating
clearing organizations require that: 
(a) Each participating market professional acknowledge in writing that any money, securities, or property, including
securities option positions, held on his behalf in a non-proprietary cross-margining account (``cross-margining
property'') will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms of this Order and any other applicable order issued
by the Commission; 
(b) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that any cross-margining property
held on his behalf by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM will be customer
property deemed to be received by the participating FCM to be accounted for, treated, and dealt with by such FCM as belonging
to such market professional in a manner consistent with section 4d of the Act; 
(c) Each participating market professional agree in writing that, in the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, or
receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution of funds held by a participating clearing firm against
which such market professional has a customer net equity claim in respect of the cross-margining property, such claim
shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission
Regulation 190.01(hh), 17 CFR 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate to money, securities, or property
in any cross-margining account; and 
(d) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that cross-margining property held
for or on his behalf will not be customer property under the Federal securities laws to the extent necessary to effect
this Order and will not be customer property under subchapter III of chapter 7 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11
U.S.C. 741-752 or the Securities Investor Protection Act (``SIPA''), 15 U.S.C. 78aaa 

et seq., 

and will not be claimed as such, and will be customer property under the Act, subchapter IV of chapter 7 of title 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 761-766, and part 190 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR part 190; 
Whereas, each participating market professional which signs such a participant agreement will be a customer of a
participating FCM; 
Whereas, each participating clearing firm will treat money, securities, and property received in respect of all
accounts other than cross-margining accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Commission and
the SEC appropriate thereto;

Whereas, SIPC has represented that it has no objection to the agreements under which a participating market professional's
cross-margining property would not be deemed to be customer property for the purposes of SIPA; and 
Whereas, the SEC has concurred with the treatment of securities positions and cross-margining accounts set forth
in this Order; 
Now Therefore, based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the cross-margining proposal submitted by CCC
and ICC is implemented consistently with the representations and agreements cited herein, and provided that: 
(a) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and participating market professional
execute the agreements referred to herein; 
(b) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and depository separately account
for cross-margining property maintained in non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and not commingle such cross-margining
property with money, securities, and property maintained in any non-cross-margining accounts or proprietary cross-margining
accounts; 
(c) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, participating market professional,
and depository provide the Commission with access to its books and records with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining
accounts and positions in a manner consistent with Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31;
(d) Each participating clearing firm include all cross-margining property received from participating market
professionals as provided herein to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts,
commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, or accruing to such participating market professionals
as a result of such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, when calculating
segregation requirements for the purposes of Section 4d of the Act; 
(e) Each participating clearing firm compute total segregation requirements under Section 4d of the Act and Commission
Regulation 1.32, 17 CFR 1.32, by calculating separately the requirements for cross-margining and non-cross-margining
accounts without using any net liquidating equity in one account to reduce a deficit in the other; 
(f) Each participating clearing firm designate non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and positions as such
in its books and records, including both internal documents maintained at the firms and account statements sent to
participating market professionals; 
(g) Each participating clearing organization calculate the margin requirements for each non-proprietary cross-margining
account separately from the margin requirements for other accounts, including proprietary cross-margining accounts;
collect any margin required with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining accounts separately without applying
any margin in any such account to satisfy a margin requirement in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account and without applying any margin in a non-cross-margining customer account to satisfy a margin requirement
in any proprietary account or any non-proprietary cross-margining account; and maintain all cross-margining property
received from participating clearing firms to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity
futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for non-proprietary
cross-margining accounts or held in such accounts, and all accruals resulting from such trades, contracts, commodity
option transactions, or securities option transactions, separately from money, securities, and property received
to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions,
or securities option transactions that are effected for or held in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining
customer account, and related accruals; and 
(h) Each participating clearing organization satisfy any deficiency in a non-proprietary cross-margining account
without recourse to non-cross-margining segregated funds;

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating clearing firm may commingle cross-margining property maintained
in respect of the non-proprietary cross-margining arrangement among CCC, ICC, and OCC with money, securities, and
property maintained in respect of similar Commission-approved non-proprietary cross-margining arrangements
between CCC and other commodity clearing organizations, between ICC and other commodity clearing organizations,
or between OCC and other commodity clearing organizations, and may apply such commingled money, securities, and
property to meet its obligations to a commodity or option clearing organization arising from trades or positions
held in its non-proprietary cross-margining account established pursuant to one or more of such cross-margining
arrangements, provided that the participating clearing firm: 
(i) Separately identify and account for the money, securities, and property held pursuant to each of the non-proprietary
cross-margining arrangements; and 
(ii) Separately calculate the margin requirements with respect to each of the non-proprietary-cross-margining
arrangements, treating each position as being held pursuant to only one such arrangement; 


It is hereby ordered,

 Pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act: 
(1) That all money, securities, and property received by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with
a participating FCM to margin, guarantee, or secure securities option trades or contracts carried in a non-proprietary-cross-margining
account for or on behalf of participating market professionals, or accruing as a result of such trades or contracts,
and held subject to the terms of this Order, shall be deemed to have been received by the participating FCM and shall
be accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the participating market professional customers of the
participating FCM consistently with section 4d of the Act; 
(2) That, subject to the terms of this Order, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Commission's regulations
(including, but not limited to, Regulations 1.20(a), 1.22, and 1.24, 17 CFR 1.20(a), 1.22, and 1.24), the money, securities,
and property described in the preceding paragraph of this Order may be commingled in a non-proprietary cross-margining
account with money, securities, and property received by a participating FCM to margin, guarantee, or secure trades
or positions in eligible commodity futures or commodity option contracts, or accruing as a result of such trades or
contracts, and otherwise required by the Commission to be segregated under the Act; and 
(3) That, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution
of funds held by a participating clearing firm, any customer net equity claim which a participating market professional

<DOCTITLE>Noncompetitive Award of Financial Assistance; Industrialized Housing: Product and Process Research Proposal</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant
to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award a cooperative agreement to University of
Oregon (UO). The award represents a continuation of DOE funded research for the UO to produce marketable industrialized
housing that is more energy efficient. Public Law 95-224 provides the statutory authority for the proposed
award.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

UO has been engaged in industrialized housing research for the last four years and has made successful advances to
produce marketable industrialized housing that is more energy efficient and has a lower operating and first cost
than conventional ``stick-built'' construction. Research under the cooperative agreement will provide needed
data to DOE and industry utilizing industrialized housing technologies.


Therefore, the financial assistance application is being accepted because the work to be funded is necessary to continue
activities presently being funded by DOE and the work will enhance the public benefit. DOE knows of no other entity
which is conducting such an activity in the near or distant future. The project period for the cooperative agreement
is expected to begin in November 1993 for a five year period. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $10,075,000
for this project period.

<DOCTITLE>Future Use of the Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2; Meeting</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Fossil Energy, DOE.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy plans to evaluate options for future use of Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2, including
options for development of the conventional oil and natural gas resources that may be contained within these Reserves.
Reserve Number 1 occupies 41,000 acres in Garfield County, Colorado, and Reserve Number 2 occupies 90,000 acres in
Carbon and Uintah Counties, Utah. Approximately 40 percent of the Utah Reserve is included within the Uintah and Ouray
Indian Reservation. Two open hearings are planned to provide opportunity for public comment on possible, future
uses for these properties.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Naval Oil Shale Reserves Numbers 1 and 2 originally were set aside by Congress to furnish the Navy with a supply of fuel
in the event of a national emergency. Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 1 is estimated to have more than 18 billion barrels
of oil in place, with approximately 2.5 billion barrels of oil recoverable from shale rated at 30 gallons or more per
ton. Naval Oil Shale Reserve No. 2 is estimated to have almost 4 billion barrels of shale oil in place. No estimate of
recoverable shale oil has been made. The Department of Energy has no current plans to develop the oil shale resources
of either Reserve No. 1 or Reserve No. 2.






The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves' Strategic Plan recognizes that although development of shale oil has
been deferred, the potential for conventional oil and gas resources within the Naval Oil Shale Reserves properties
must be assessed and plans formulated to develop these resources in the near to mid-term. Based upon current and past
production from oil and gas fields located in the vicinities of the Naval Oil Shale Reserves, the potential for recovery
of substantial quantities of oil and natural gas from within the Reserves' boundaries is quite high. Options for development
of these resources includes partnerships with industry (lease or farmout), Federal development, or simply deferring
development, maintaining all or a portion of the properties as wilderness areas. Attendance at each of the two scheduled
hearings will be limited to sixty persons. Oral and/or written presentations are invited. Oral presentations will
be limited to five minutes each.

<DOCTITLE>CWA 303(d): EPA's Intent To Approve and Availability of State List Submissions </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency, Region II. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) intent to approve the lists submitted to
the U.S. EPA pursuant to Clean Water Act (CWA) section 303(d) by the State of New York, the State of New Jersey, and the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on September 4, 1992, May 20, 1993, and November 18, 1993, respectively. Please be advised
that the U.S. Virgin Islands is not required to submit a 303(d) list because there are no water quality-limited segments
in the U.S. Virgin Islands requiring Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL). EPA issued its intent to approve the New York
State September 4, 1992 list submittal on May 18, 1993. With regard to the New Jersey May 20, 1993 and the Puerto Rico
November 18, 1993 list submittals, 
although EPA has not yet sent out approval letters, EPA does intend to approve both of these list submittals as well.




In the case of the Puerto Rico section 303(d) list, it should be noted that several modifications, which will affect
the Commonwealth's section 303(d) list, have been agreed upon by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB)
and EPA subsequent to the November 18, 1993 submittal. These proposed modifications reflect recent negotiations
between PREQB and EPA regarding 1994 permitting priorities in Puerto Rico. The current Puerto Rico section 303(d)
list does not reflect these specific modifications. Since the section 303(d) process is ongoing, another comprehensive
review/revision of all State section 303(d) lists is scheduled to take place in April, 1994. At that time the Puerto
Rico section 303(d) list will be updated to include all agreed upon modifications. 

EPA is soliciting public comment on its intent to approve these 303(d) lists, which, together with EPA's tentative
approval documents, are available to the public. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987, requires every State to: Identify
those waters within its boundaries for which the effluent limitations required by section 301(b)(1)(A) and section
301(b)(1)(B) of the CWA are not stringent enough to meet any water quality standard applicable to such waters. Each
State is required to identify the pollutants causing the impairment of the listed waters. Section 303(d) further
requires the State to establish a priority ranking for such waters, taking into account the severity of the pollution
and the designated uses of these waters. Finally, the State is required to identify waters targeted for TMDL development
over the next two (2) years. TMDLs establish the allowable pollutant loadings necessary for a waterbody to meet applicable
State water quality standards. 
State 303(d) lists and TMDLs are submitted to EPA for approval or disapproval. The deadline for submitting the above
lists to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was October 22, 1992 (See 57 FR 33047 (July 24, 1992)).




Consistent with 40 CFR 130.7, New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico submitted to EPA, for approval, their listing decisions
under section 303(d) on September 4, 1992, May 20, 1993, and November 18, 1993, respectively. EPA today notices its
intent to approve these lists and solicits public comment on both the intent to approve and on the lists. EPA is soliciting
comments on the New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico 1992 CWA section 303(d) lists and approvals. All future biennial
submissions of the 303(d) lists will provide for public comment at the State level. 

The lists and approvals are available by mail or for public inspection at the EPA Region 2 office by appointment. To
request a copy of a list and/or approval, to make arrangements to examine the lists, or to submit comments, contact
the Agency representative identified above. Comments must be submitted within thirty (30) days of the publication
of this notice. 

Following the close of the comment period, EPA will make a final determination on the State lists and will issue a response

to comments received. A copy of EPA's decision and response to comments document will be sent to all parties submitting
comments in response to this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Water Pollution Control; Approval of Application by South Dakota To Administer the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Approval of application.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 30, 1993, the Acting Regional Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region VIII,
approved the application by the State of South Dakota to administer and enforce the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) program for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters within the State.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The application of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) was received by EPA on
April 28, 1993. Several modifications were made to the application package, based on discussions between the EPA,
the DENR, and the Office of the Attorney General. The final changes, including the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement
by the Governor, were completed on August 30, 1993. 



South Dakota's application was described in 

Federal Register

 notices dated September 1 and 9, 1993, at 58 FR 46145 and 47417, and in notices published in the Rapid City Journal and
the Sioux Falls Argus-Leader on August 27 and September 10, 1993. In the September 1, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice and the August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, EPA highlighted three issues upon which it specifically requested
public comment. These issues concerned unsigned complaints from the general public, penalty authority, and citizen
intervention in enforcement actions. 

Copies of South Dakota's application package were available for public review at the EPA Region VIII office and at
the DENR office in Pierre, South Dakota. Copies also could be purchased from the DENR at a cost of $10.00. 

EPA provided copies of South Dakota's public notices to permitted facilities, tribal councils and tribal environmental
agencies, and environmental groups in South Dakota. The mailing list used is part of the record of the program application
and review process. By letter dated August 25, 1993, EPA provided copies of South Dakota's application to the U.S.
Fish & Wildlife Service, and to the South Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer. 

As part of the public comment process, EPA conducted two public hearings on South Dakota's application. The hearings
occurred on October 14, 1993 at the Matthew Training Center, Joe Foss Building, 523 East Capitol, Pierre, South Dakota,
beginning at 3 and 7 p.m. The first hearing lasted approximately one hour, and the second lasted about 45 minutes. The
register of those attending is contained in the administrative record. In addition, until October 22, 1993, EPA accepted
written comments from the public. All comments or objections presented at either public hearing or received in writing
by EPA Region VIII by October 22, 1993, were considered by EPA. 

Comments were received regarding the following issues: (1) Unsigned complaints, (2) penalty authority, (3) citizen
intervention, (4) jurisdiction over Indian Country, (5) pretreatment program, (6) mechanisms for ensuring protection
of endangered and threatened species, and (7) overall benefits or lack of benefits resulting from authorization.
EPA response to all comments are contained in this notice. Summaries of the comments and EPA's responses follow. The
comments and hearing record are contained in the administrative record supporting this notice. 



I. Unsigned Complaints 



Federal regulations at 40 CFR 123.26(b)(3) and (4) require a State approved to administer the NPDES program to maintain
a program for investigating information regarding violations of applicable program and permit requirements, to
maintain procedures for receiving and ensuring proper consideration of information submitted by the public about
violations of applicable program and permit requirements, to encourage public efforts in reporting violations,
and to make available information on reporting procedures. 

As outlined in EPA's September 1, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, Section 34A-2-111 of the South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL)
prohibits the DENR from performing inspections or conducting other investigatory activities pursuant to SDCL Sections
34A-2-40, 34A-2-44, and 34A-2-45 based on, or as a result of, information received
from the general public unless the person providing the information signs a complaint, which is to remain confidential
with the DENR. The statement by the South Dakota Attorney General notes that information in complaints from the general
public made to another agency or DENR program and then referred to the DENR NPDES program is not considered ``as a result
of'' a complaint from the general public. 

The State has described the means by which it will consider and respond to NPDES-related information from the general
public and from other state governmental agencies. The DENR will investigate and respond to all citizen complaints
where a signed complaint form has been received and will investigate all complaints received from other government
agencies. At the time an unsigned complaint is received, DENR will determine whether appropriate department authorities
exist under any state environmental statute to handle the unsigned complaint. If not, the citizen shall be referred
to the South Dakota Department of Emergency and Disaster Services, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish &
Parks, or another appropriate State agency. The appropriate State agencies shall receive anonymous complaints
and either investigate under their authorities or sign and refer the complaint to DENR. The process used for investigating
and responding to unsigned complaints will be published in major newspapers in South Dakota and will be prominently
posted in the main office and the field offices of the DENR. 

In its oversight role, EPA has established a ``hotline'' (1-800-227-8917) to receive complaints,
both identified and anonymous, regarding NPDES-related activities in South Dakota. To communicate this fact to
the general public, EPA will publish the hotline number in the Rapid City ``Journal'' and the Sioux Falls ``Argus-Leader'',
as well as sending a notice to public interest groups and permitted facilities. The hotline number may be used by callers
who have information concerning a possible violation of an NPDES permit or program requirement. The caller will be
referred to a staff member of the EPA Region VIII NPDES Branch. This staff person will record the information received
and make a decision whether or not an investigation is needed. EPA may conduct the investigation or request that the
DENR investigate.

A. Comments in Support of Sec. 34A-2-111 



Those supporting South Dakota's system for addressing unsigned complaints included the DENR, municipal, agricultural,
and mining associations, municipalities, another State agency, and industrial dischargers. 

1. Several commenters questioned the motives of people who submit unsigned complaints and/or the merits of such complaints.
They referred to the right to face one's accusers. Their comments included:

A few persons stated that unsigned complaints result from feuds, cranks, or competitors. 

Two expressed the opinion that if a complaint is genuine, the person making it should have the commitment to sign it.
A representative of an agricultural group that identified itself as the prime sponsor of Sec. 34A-2-111
stated that ``there should be a great deal of responsibility laid at the feet of those people making the complaint * * *.
[South Dakota is] a stand-up place * * * South Dakota newspapers, by and large, don't accept letters
to the editors that are unsigned. South Dakota State agencies, by and large, do not accept letters of complaint or phone
calls that are anonymous. South Dakota Attorney General's office does not accept complaints that are anonymous,
with some exceptions.'' Two commenters stated that a person is entitled to face his accusers and is protected from
anonymous harassment. One of them cited the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

2. Some commenters indicated that the state government and the regulated community should be protected from unsigned
complaints: 

One city official noted that unsigned complaints can have a detrimental effect upon an organization otherwise trying
to work cooperatively to achieve compliance. 

``* * * an anonymous phone call or letter is too easy a method to trigger an environmental audit * * *.''


``[Section] 34A-2-111 is a necessary statute that helps to limit the expenditure of staff time on frivolous
personal grudge type complaints.'' 

3. Some commenters praised DENR's record in conducting investigations and allowing for public participation. They
also noted the existence of the EPA ``800'' number. Their remarks included: 

The Secretary, DENR, asserted in his written statement: ``To our knowledge, since the passage of this law [SDCL Section
34A-2-111], this law has never hindered our ability to address water pollution incidents nor has it hindered
public involvement.'' 

``* * * the current SDCL Section 34A-2-111 is working very well. DENR is very responsible
in investigating complaints and has a system in place to guarantee that investigations take place once a complaint
arises and to keep the identity of the party making the complaint confidential.'' 

A few commenters referred to the fact that EPA is maintaining an ``800'' number for persons not wishing to communicate
with the state. 

4. Several commenters indicated that the state's system provides sufficient opportunity for public participation
and agency investigation of complaints. They supported this point by identifying three ways in which Section 34A-2-111
was restricted in its applicability: 

a. The prohibition applies to complaints from the general public, not to complaints made or passed on by another federal,
state or local level of government. If DENR determines that it lacks authority to investigate a complaint, the complaint
is then referred to another agency. 

b. The prohibition does not apply to the state's mining laws, solid waste laws, and hazardous waste laws. Most complaints
from factory workers will relate to hazardous waste violations, which are not covered by this prohibition. 

c. The prohibition does not apply to DENR's right of entry, to the issuance of an emergency order, to determinations
of responsibility for discharges, to waste disposal into state waters, and to more general authorities to investigate
violations of Chapter 34A-2. 



B. Comments Opposing Sec. 34A-2-111 



Those opposing South Dakota's system for handling unsigned complaints included environmental groups and individuals
working in municipal facilities. 

1. Some commenters stated that people hesitate to sign complaints because they fear reprisals: 

An anonymous individual who described himself or herself as a ``person employed in the wastewater and pretreatment
field in the State of South Dakota'' stated, ``Many times people are reluctant to sign complaints because of some type
of repercussion.'' 

``It is a reality that many individuals are reluctant to report suspected or obvious discharge violations for fear
of reprisal. Real or perceived, it is a reality.''

An environmental group (which stated that it had recently concluded a successful citizen's suit against a mining
company in South Dakota) commented that it had filed written complaints with the DENR based on anonymous tips that
it, rather than the DENR, had received. Citizens had been reluctant to file a complaint even if it was considered ``confidential.''
This group also stated that it had never found any citizen complaint to be frivolous or harassing. 

2. Several commenters criticized the process for investigating and responding to unsigned complaints, described
in Item E.4. on page 7 of the MOA. Their comments included: 

``The MOA should contain unequivocal language setting forth a specific procedure for SDDENR to follow for maintaining
(1) an investigation of violations and (2) procedures for ensuring proper consideration of information from the
public about violations.'' 

``We do find fault, at times, with the depth and timeliness of the `investigation' conducted by DENR upon our filed
complaints. Investigations conducted several days to weeks after a complaint is filed may miss a violation.'' 

``In South Dakota, with its small population and overlapping networks of personal and business relationships, unsigned
complaints_if they are seriously considered by SDDENR are likely to be the most fruitful sources of violation reporting.''


``It is not clear * * * whether department authorities exist within SDDENR to appropriately handle
unsigned citizen complaints if referred by another State agency. . . . We do not consider it
appropriate to burden other State agencies whose administrative and field staff are already clearly overworked.''


``Any unsigned complaint will simply fall into the cracks between agencies and nothing will be done.'' 

``The Departments of Agriculture and Game, Fish and Parks do not have authority or expertise for dealing with complaints
that are properly the concern of SDDENR.'' 

3. Some commenters indicated that SDCL prevented South Dakota's application from meeting pertinent authorization
requirements: 

``We believe neither SDCL 34A-2-111 nor EPA's proposed solution meets the requirements of Section 402(b)(2)(B)
and Section 402(b)(7) of the Clean Water Act, and 40 CFR Sections 123.26(b)(3) and (4) * * *. EPA should
withhold NPDES delegation until SDCL 34A-2-111 is repealed.'' 

``The requirements of forty (sic) CFR Sections 123.26(b)(3) and (4) will not be met under the MOA because of the convoluted
nature of provisions for receiving and dealing with unsigned complaints.'' 

4. Some commenters stated that the state's procedure for handling unsigned complaints created the impression that
the state favored special interests over the general public: 

``If there's a problem, [most citizens] want action, no matter whom they call. For a citizen to be told they have to call
another agency to get a water problem addressed just confirms [the] citizen's view of government as controlled by
special interests who get laws like 34A-2-111 approved * * *. State government should
not be empowered by EPA to cripple or make more difficult and confusing citizens' ability to work directly with the
proper state regulators because of paranoia on the part of the special interests who are regulated under water quality
laws.'' 
Two individuals commented in a letter that they were ``appalled of (sic) the manner in which the State intends on handling
or rather not handling citizen complaints and the legalese double talk the State Attorney General's office is trying
to portray as meaningful procedures.'' 



C. EPA's Response to Comments on Sec. 34A-2-111 



The State has a program and procedures for public reporting of violations that ensures their proper consideration,
even though the existence of  34A-2-111 appears to require a more cumbersome process than is desirable.
EPA might propose a simpler program or procedures for a hypothetical ``model'' state program. However, under the
Clean Water Act, a State is provided flexibility in achieving the minimum requirements of the Act, including those
for public participation. If approached by another state on suggestions for public reporting, EPA would recommend
against inclusion of a Section 111-type provision. EPA encourages South Dakota to repeal Section 111 as inefficient
and having the potential to limit the discretion of the very state agency entrusted to exercise enforcement discretion.


EPA doubts that facilities subject to DENR investigations could use Section 111 as a means to avoid the consequences
for failing to comply with  34A-2-40, -44, and -45. DENR investigators are not required
by any provision of state law to identify the basis for the information leading to investigation. Moreover, DENR has
authority to initiate prosecution based on verified information. Notwithstanding questions about enforceability,
DENR has indicated its intention to faithfully implement applicable provisions of state law, as well as to implement
public participation procedures to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 123.27(d). EPA encourages DENR to periodically
evaluate the effectiveness of its public reporting procedures in providing public participation in the NPDES enforcement
program in South Dakota, particularly in light of the existence of Section 111.

The fact that the prohibition in 34A-2-111 does not apply to complaints from governmental entities or
to other State environmental programs provides the State some options for the general public to use in reporting concerns
about possible violation or problems related to wastewater treatment or effluent. The description of the State process
will be published in major newspapers in South Dakota and posted in the DENR offices located throughout the State.
Therefore, mechanisms exist to ensure proper consideration of information from the general public and are sufficient
to meet the minimum requirements of public participation consistent with 40 CFR 123.26. 

EPA acknowledges there may be some delay in investigation of information received from the general public because
of the requirement for a signed complaint. South Dakota has explained, however, that the requirement should not unduly
delay prompt investigation when the member of the general public indicates a willingness to identify himself or herself
and sign a complaint. 

The volume of unsigned complaints which are received by 
any one entity is not expected to be so great that it would strain the resources available to that organization. However,
the DENR is responsible for assuring whatever resources needed to respond to unsigned complaints are available,
as well as providing adequate resources to administer the NPDES program as a whole. 

EPA notes that the adequacy and effectiveness of DENR's public reporting requirements are easily verified, both
by EPA and the general public. If the described procedures do not, in practice, provide for adequate and effective
public reporting, DENR's compliance with public reporting requirements may be reexamined. Should subsequent administrative
or judicial interpretations of Section 111 broaden its scope from that described in the program submission or otherwise
impair implementation of the public reporting procedures, EPA may reevaluate whether the existence of Section 111
yet enables DENR to adequately administer the NPDES program. 



Motives of Anonymous Tipsters, Rights of the Accused, and Complainant Fear of Reprisal 



EPA does not dispute that some complaints may be submitted with questionable motives or that signed complaints may
often be more credible than unsigned ones. ``Crank'' calls may be from disgruntled neighbors or business competitors.
However, a statute is not needed to eliminate the problems associated with frivolous calls. The DENR has professionally
trained staff capable of screening out such calls, based on the information provided or not provided. Such calls are
also possible from persons who do sign their names. 

The fact that the prohibition applies only to the general public and not to other governmental entities allows the
NPDES program to use information referred to it by these entities. This information may be provided as problems the
entities have identified in the course of their duties (including accepting referrals). It may also come from problems
identified by complainants to other entities about their programs which contain information also applicable to
the NPDES program. 

Regarding the rights of the accused, the Sixth Amendment right to face accusers applies in criminal cases when the
testimony of an informant is to be used in trial. However, if an informant's tip is independently confirmed by a law
enforcement agency and the testimony of the informant is not needed at trial, then any rights under this amendment
have not been affected.

Fear of reprisal may occur even in situations where a person does not have to provide a name, since in small communities
it might be fairly easy to figure out or at least narrow down the persons likely to have reported the information. In
addition, employees may fear reprisal from their employers should they report possible violations of NPDES statutes,
regulations, or permit conditions. However, such fears may be diminished by the fact that SDCL 34A-2-111
requires the identity of the complainant to be kept confidential. 



Protection of Agencies and Regulated Community/Favoring Special Interests 



A frivolous claim may place a strain on an organization trying to cooperate. However, the potential for strain is offset
by the potential to promote the general good which complaints may provide the State in identifying and correcting
problems early on. Also, it would seem that there would be few instances of complaints being merely frivolous or harassing.


There is always the chance that actions by governmental entities may be misconstrued by the general public. This is
not a basis for determining a program does not meet the requirements for delegation. However, this is an issue both
the SDDENR and the EPA will be sensitive to as they administer and oversee the NPDES program. 

The State of South Dakota is a sparsely populated state with relatively few industries. Moreover, the existence of
overlapping business and personal networks provides an opportunity for someone removed from a situation to provide
information instead of someone concerned about retaliation from an employer. South Dakota's small population and
overlapping networks may be productive sources of information. These networks can work to the advantage of the NPDES
program in that possible NPDES violations, particularly those affecting surface waters may be reported in connection
with information supplied to other environmental programs. For example, according to the DENR, the DENR Ground Water
program has the lead on spills and contacts the NPDES staff when there is a potential for surface waters to be affected.
The Mining program will generally receive any tips regarding mining problem spills/discharges (e.g. cyanide) and
share them with the NPDES staff. Game Fish & Parks recently referred a case of a discharge without a permit to the
DENR. That agency also uses its own authority when the discharge is in the area of a fishery. All of these programs are
not affected by the prohibition in SDCL 34A-2-111 and, in the past, have received and forwarded complaints
which also related to NPDES-related activities. 

The concern expressed that information may fall between the cracks is a valid one. It is possible this could occur in
any process for receiving information sources outside the administering office. However, the system established
for investigating and responding to complaints provides that the DENR will investigate and respond to all citizen
complaints where a signed complaint form has been received and will investigate all complaints received from other
government agencies. 



Conclusion 



EPA determines that the procedure South Dakota has established is adequate to comply with the Clean Water Act and with
NPDES federal regulations. South Dakota has established a process to deal with issues raised by the general public
by accepting signed complaints and being required to keep the identity of the source confidential and by referring
other complaints to another State agency. The Governor, as a signatory to the MOA, has committed to follow the process
for receiving and responding to information from sources outside the State NPDES program. 

Though section 111 may not provide an adequate program for public reporting in other states or for other programs,
under the particular circumstances of the DENR NPDES program, the state procedures are adequate for the following
reasons: (1) South Dakota is not heavily industrialized, (2) the prohibition pertains only to water programs and
not other media programs, (3) the state is sparsely populated for the most part, (4) the right of entry ( 34A-2-46)
is not impaired, (5) the prohibition provision does not appear to be directly enforceable by dischargers, and (6)
the State NPDES program retains the authority to respond in emergencies (see 34A-2-68), to enforce against
persons causing pollution of waters (see 34A-2-21), and to conduct investigations to determine the responsible
person for causing a discharge which may cause or has caused pollution of state waters (see 34A-2-71.1)
regardless of the source of information leading to these actions. 

The situation in South Dakota is such that there are overlapping networks of state agencies and there are active environmental
groups which will identify issues on behalf of their membership and of individuals who communicate information and
concerns to their groups. 

EPA notes that anonymous tips are just one source of complaints, albeit a significant source. The statute does not
place restrictions on any other sources of information or other activities than those defined in 34A-2-40,
-44, and -45. 

EPA oversight includes an hotline number (1-800-227-8917) to receive complaints from all sources.
Oversight also includes monitoring the DENR process and results from public participation in compliance and enforcement.
If there appears to be a problem, EPA will revisit this aspect of the program with DENR.

II. Penalty Authority 



Section 402(b)(2)(B) of the CWA requires an authorized state program to have authority to inspect, monitor, enter,
and require reports to at least the same extent as required by section 308 of the CWA. Section 402(b)(7) of the CWA requires
an authorized state program to have adequate authority to abate violations of permits or the permit program through
penalties and other means of enforcement. EPA State NPDES program requirements at 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i) provide
that an approved state program is to have the authority to recover civil penalties for the violation of ``any NPDES
filing requirement'' and ``any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities,'' as well as
for the violation of any NPDES permit condition or any regulation or order issued by the state program director. 

As outlined in EPA's September 1, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, South Dakota does not have direct statutory authority to collect civil
penalties, or criminally enforce, a failure to comply with SDCL 34A-2-44 (record-keeping), 34A-2-45
and -46 (inspection authorities), due to a lack of citation to SDCL 34A-2-75 (penalty provision)
in these sections. However, because the Department [of Environment and Natural Resources] can prosecute (both civilly
and criminally) violations of permit conditions and because it can set permit conditions for recording, reporting,
monitoring, entry, and inspection under 34A-2-40, it can enforce these statutes for permitted facilities.


The Department can, with regard to unpermitted facilities, obtain both the records and entry for inspections pursuant
to search warrants issued on the basis of the criminal provisions of SDCL 34A-2-75 and the violation of
SDCL 34A-2-36 (operating without the required permit). Civil penalties for failure to comply with SDCL
34A-2-44, -45, and -46 by an unpermitted facility are available only through violation of
an order issued by the Department pursuant to SDCL 34A-2-53. 



A. Comments Favoring Existing Penalty Authority 



The DENR and various members of the regulated community expressed opinions that the lack of a direct authority to impose
penalties for violations of the cited statutes would have little affect on the ability of the State to exact penalties
for failure to comply with the statutes. 

One commenter from the regulated community thought that no detrimental effects would be expected and, therefore,
the system for collecting penalties was adequate until such time as the matter was corrected by the legislative process.
The Secretary of the DENR noted that the Attorney General's Statement indicated that reporting requirements will
be included in the permit, and are therefore enforceable for permitted facilities. As to unpermitted facilities,
the Secretary of the DENR (who would be the party issuing orders) stated that the DENR could issue an enforcement order
in a timely manner to require any necessary reporting or sampling and that the DENR could enforce these orders. The
Secretary also cited a recent water pollution enforcement case settlement which included a penalty of $489,000 and
was accomplished without the authority to enforce any NPDES condition or requirement. He stated that delegation
would only increase the abilities of the DENR to enforce violations of the state's environmental laws. Another state
agency noted that ``It appears * * * that the case where this EPA concern would be applicable
is for facilities that are discharging without a permit and not keeping records. For these facilities, failure to
have a permit would be a more severe violation than the failure to keep records.'' 

One commenter thought that penalties for items normally found in a permit should not begin to accrue for an unpermitted
facility until after the state issues an order. 



B. Comments Criticizing Existing Penalty Authority 



Those who criticized the existing authority were the pretreatment coordinator for a municipal treatment facility
and one environmental group. They questioned the ability of the authority to stand up to judicial review and the round-about
means the DENR would have to use to exercise the authority in collecting penalties. 

One commenter expressed the opinion that the state's authority to collect penalties from unpermitted facilities
is not clear, particularly in light of the 

Freeman 

v. 

South Dakota 

lawsuit. In that case, the court found that Mr. Freeman's civil rights were violated when, upon refusing State health
inspectors entry, he was served with a closure order. The commenter stated that the finding was made because the citation
under licensure statutes failed to cite an enforcement provision. 

An environmental group indicated that the State's roundabout legal reasoning to support its authority to obtain
records and entry to inspect at unpermitted facilities may be overlooked by a judge faced with what appears to be a clear
failure to provide for criminal and civil sanctions for record-keeping or inspection violations. Specific penalty
provision language must be added to 34A-2-44, -45, and -46 in order to comply with 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i).


Another environmental organization stated that the state should have direct statutory authority to collect civil
penalties and to criminally enforce a failure to comply with Sec. 34A-2-44. They also noted that the MOA
should require South Dakota to adopt less round-about methods to obtain records and entry and to be able to do so without
the DENR having to issue an order. They believed that formal issuance of orders and search warrants can take too much
time. 



C. EPA's Response to Comments on Penalty Authority 



EPA's authorization regulations require civil penalties to be recoverable for the violation of any NPDES permit
condition; any NPDES filing requirement; any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities;
or any regulation or orders issued by the State Director. See 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i). The State has demonstrated an
adequate authority and methodology for collecting penalties from permitted and unpermitted facilities. However,
EPA would recommend a legislative amendments to 34A-2-44, -45, and -46 to define failure to
comply with each as a violation enforceable through 34A-2-53. These amendments would allow a more direct,
and thereby more effective, implementation of the enforcement program.

Adequacy of the Ability To Recover Penalties 


The State has shown that legal mechanisms exist for exacting penalties tied to permitted and unpermitted facilities
which fail to comply with SDCL 34A-2-44, -45, and -46. The authorities used are not specifically
based on a violation of these statutes. However, they do provide for 'civil penalties to be recoverable' for refusal
to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities, which is what 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i) requires.

The situation in 

Freeman 

v. 

South Dakota 

does not apply to the State's authority to collect penalties for refusals to allow the state to inspect potential water
pollution violations. In that case, State inspectors had summarily terminated a campground's license because the
campground's operator would not allow the state to inspect without a warrant. In 

Freeman

, civil rights were violated because the State inspectors lacked statutory enforcement authority. In the Case of
South Dakota NPDES, SDDENR does have adequate statutory authority to issue administrative orders. The South Dakota
Attorney General has stated South Dakota has adequate statutory authority to implement the program described. 


Calculation of Penalties 


Ignorance of the law is not an argument for deferring penalties. The regulated community is notified through public
notice of the requirements for permits, right of entry, etc. It is their responsibility to be aware of these requirements
and be accountable for them from the time the requirements become effective. 
EPA agrees that the penalty for failure to have a permit might be more severe than for a failure to keep records by itself.
However, both requirements are normally available to the regulator in taking enforcement actions. The existence
of a penalty for a discharge without a permit does not, by itself, offset the need for a mechanism to collect penalties
for 
failure to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring requirements. As noted earlier, such a mechanism exists.

Regarding the date at which a violation begins, the State has asserted that administrative orders or search warrants
could be issued within one or two days. Therefore, the number of days of violation used to calculate penalties for unpermitted
facilities would be almost the same as for permitted facilities. In cases where a discharge causes pollution of any
waters of the state, the penalty can be calculated for each day the discharge occurred as a violation of 34A-2-21,
subject to a  34A-2-75 order. The number of days of violation is just one factor applied in calculating
penalties. The small difference in the number of days of violation between permitted and unpermitted facilities
could be offset by the presence of other factors in calculating and negotiating the final penalty (e.g. the existence
of another violation -discharge without a permit). Therefore, the immediate revision of SDCL 34A-2-44,
-45, and -46 is not required. However, EPA does consider such revisions desirable, so that the State would
have more direct remedies for these violations. 
It should also be noted that EPA, in its oversight role, can take enforcement action. Typically, EPA would send to the
State a Notice of Violation and give the State 30 days to take action. If the State were not to take sufficient action,
including not collecting a large enough penalty, EPA could file an order and collect penalties from the date the violations
started. Citizen suits are also a means to assure appropriate penalties are collected. 


Conclusion 


EPA finds that the penalty authority and process for collecting penalties is adequate and serves as a protection against
noncompliance with water pollution control law, rules, and permits. EPA's oversight role offers a second level of
protection. A third level of protection is offered by related statutes, such as prohibiting discharges which may
cause or cause pollution of waters of the state (see 34A-2-21), prohibiting discharge of waste or pollutants
without a permit (see 34A-2-36), and prohibiting reduction of existing water quality (see 34A-2-22).
Therefore, the DENR NPDES program adequately meets the requirements for recovering penalties. 


III. Citizen Intervention 


EPA's September 1, 1993 

Federal Register

 and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices requested public comment on South Dakota's statutory procedure for citizen
intervention in administrative enforcement actions, as required by 40 CFR 123.27(d). South Dakota has certified
that it allows intervention as of right in administrative enforcement actions pursuant to SDCL Sec. 34A-10-2.
It has indicated that Sec. 34A-10-2, considered alone, appears to grant merely ``permissive intervention'';
that is, intervention if no other party objects). However, South Dakota has also certified that if a citizen is denied
intervenor status in an administrative case, he may file a lawsuit in circuit court to have the court order him to be
named as a party in the administrative proceeding, pursuant to Sec. 34A-10-5. Because of the possibility
for such a circuit court proceeding, South Dakota's Attorney General construes SDCL 34A-10-2 to allow
mandatory intervention in administrative procedures. The Memorandum of Agreement, a document signed both by the
State of South Dakota and the EPA, states that the SDDENR will allow intervention as of right in civil proceedings to
at least the same extent required by 40 CFR 123.27(d)(1) and shall not oppose intervention in administrative proceedings
as provided by  34A-10-2. 


A. Comments Favoring Existing Intervention Procedure 


Members of the regulated community commented that the statutory procedure afforded citizens an adequate right of
intervention. One specific comment, made by a member of the regulated community, was that the State assurance in the
MOA makes the citizen right to intervention mandatory. This commenter also noted that the Attorney General Statement
interprets SDCL 34A-10-2 to mean that the citizen's right to intervene is mandatory.

B. Comments Opposing Existing Intervention Procedure 


Environmental groups and individual citizens criticized the existing intervention procedure and its application
by the DENR. 

1. Some commenters stated that intervention rights were not being honored. 
One environmental group stated that it was ``* * * especially concerned about the problems posed * * *
by the progressive subtle and not so subtle deterioration of participation by citizens and non-profit citizens organizations
in quasi-judicial hearings.'' It referred to individual citizens being ignored at public hearings, public documents
being unavailable for review and comment before a contested case hearing, and decisions being given little publicity.
One individual commented that at a public hearing in the Fall of 1992 he ``* * * watched (and objected)
as BME Board members subverted the rules of that hearing by allowing a mining industry lawyer take control of the hearing.
Board members allowed the attorney to cross examine citizens as if they were under oath when the citizens were simply
there to testify on their own behalf. The incidents are a matter of record. They are also quite typical of DENR.'' 
Another environmental group cited instances where it or individual citizens were excluded from permit modification,
remediation, and negotiation processes. 
Another individual citizen's letter provided comments which ``* * * center[ed] on the State of South
Dakota's continued and specific efforts to stifle and judicially dissuade individuals from pursuing environmental
issues. They concluded that ``[O]bviously, the state of South Dakota has little understanding of citizen participation
and rights to involvement.'' 
``Politically powerful applicants regularly 'short-circuit' the contested case procedure with active help from
the Attorney General and the DENR. In several controversial cases * * * DENR and/or the applicant have
used various procedures to obtain 'quickie hearings' designed to thwart due process and a fair hearing. One state
board, at the urging of the Attorney General, * * * carved out a novel justification, citing SDCL 1-22-27,
that allows applicants the right to short-circuit the contested case process.'' 
``A circuit court remedy for denial of intervenors status is NO remedy because of expense and unwieldiness.'' 
2. Commenters expressed the concern that public interest and environmental groups must be represented by an attorney
at contested cases hearings. 
An environmental group stated that DENR has denied them intervention in administrative hearings if they are not represented
by an attorney. They noted that the State's application does not clearly state whether an attorney is required. 
``Public interest groups must be represented by an attorney at contested case hearings. Since hardly any of us can
afford such, the public interest has rarely been represented in the past few years.'' 
``The Board [of Minerals and the Environment] [h]as so decreed, and the state Attorney General's office has rendered
an opinion of agreement that only attorney's (sic) can present cases before the Board if the group appearing before
the Board is an association, corporation, or other similar entity. The Board has effectively prevented environmental
groups from appearing before the Board without the considerable expense of an attorney. It is our understanding that
other State Boards do not have the attorney requirement.'' 


C. EPA's Response to Comments Concerning Intervention Procedure 


EPA has determined that DENR intervention authority and procedures adequately meets the requirement of 40 CFR 123.27(d).
Citizen intervention rights will be honored. There is currently no requirement for public interest groups to be represented
by attorneys at NPDES contested case proceedings. 


Honoring Intervention Rights 


The great majority of the comments expressing concerns with the application of intervention rights pertained to
non-NPDES State program topics (e.g. mining, sewage ash, landfills) and a State board (Board of Minerals and Environment)
which will not administer the NPDES program in South Dakota. 
South Dakota statutes, rules, and program documents provide citizen access to information. SDCL 1-27-1
specifically allows for open inspection of all records and documents during normal business hours. The MOA (page
7, item E.1) provides public access to NPDES files during normal working hours. Public notice of proposed general
permits, major permits, and pretreatment program applications is provided for in the MOA (page 7, item E.3) and the
Program Description (page 9). South Dakota Rule 74:03:13:02 requires the DENR to public notice any contested case
hearing requested and the reasons for the hearing. The public notice of any proposed settlement of a State enforcement
action is required only when the authority which allows intervention as of right is not demonstrated (see 40 CFR 123.27(d)).

The Attorney General Statement construes the language of SDCL 34A-10-2 concerning intervention to be
mandatory. In addition, both the MOA (page 3, item A.13) and the Program Description (page 19) allow for citizen intervention
as of right in civil proceedings equivalent to that required by 
40 CFR 123.26(d)(1). 


Representation by an Attorney 


The South Dakota Bar Association has issued an ethics opinion that appearance before administrative agencies on
behalf of corporations or associations must be by licensed attorneys. The ruling concerning representation at contested
case hearings was in reference to contested case hearings held by the Board of Minerals and Environment. The requirement
for representation by an attorney does not appear to apply to the NPDES program. However, even in the case of the Board
of Minerals and Environment, the Board does not exclude individual citizens from full participation at hearings,
but applies the requirement for legal representation of organizations.

The DENR clarified in an addendum to the MOA regarding the NPDES program that individual members of the general public
and nonprofit organizations shall not be required to be represented by attorneys in NPDES program contested case
hearings to the extent allowed by the State Bar Association and the State Supreme Court. EPA believes that a state bar
association does not have the authority to direct the policies and procedures of a state agency which derives its authority
from the state legislature. EPA does recognize that a state bar association can constrain the activities of individual
attorneys employed by a state agency. In its oversight role, EPA will monitor future rulings of the South Dakota Bar
Association and the State Supreme Court regarding citizen intervention and whether environmental organizations
are being required to be represented by attorneys. If either of these occur, EPA will consider the impact these rulings
and requirements have on the viability of the State's NPDES enforcement program. 


Conclusion 


EPA has determined that DENR intervention authority and procedures adequately meets the requirement of 40 CFR 123.27(d).



IV. Jurisdiction Over Indian Country 


As outlined in EPA's September 1, 1993 

Federal Register

 and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, EPA withheld from NPDES program authorization consideration those lands
which were in Indian Country or for which there was significant controversy over whether or not the land was Indian
Country. As noted earlier, EPA provided copies of South Dakota's public notices to tribal councils and tribal environmental
agencies. Tribal governments and affected permittees were also provided with copies of the list of permitted facilities
which EPA would continue to administer. 
In withholding authorization for these areas, EPA was not making a determination as to whether or not South Dakota
had adequate jurisdiction. This issue was considered deferred. Nevertheless, a number of comments were received
regarding jurisdiction. No comments were received from tribal councils or tribal environmental organizations.



A. Comments Regarding EPA's Continued Administration of the NPDES Program in Indian Country 


One commenter, a member of the regulated community, stated that EPA's retaining authority within the identified
Indian Reservations should lighten the load for SDDENR. 
A number of commenters however, disagreed with EPA's administering the program in Indian Country or land in controversy.
Some of the comments were the following: 
``* * * EPA is asserting a jurisdictional authority which it cannot for regulatory and resource reasons,
carry out; the result is inconsistent environmental protection, and some geographical areas left without environmental
protection * * * If EPA insists that it carve out geographical areas of the state which should not have
equal environmental protection, then I want to make it very clear that the State of South Dakota will further pursue
the issue of jurisdiction on non-Indian lands within reservation boundaries.'' 
``To the extent that EPA retains authority over facilities located on lands other than retained Indian allotments,
we believe EPA violates the holding * * * [that] exclusive tribal and federal jurisdiction is limited
to the retained allotments * * * We believe the better policy, at least as it applies to former reservation
areas, is to grant the State authority unless the Tribe can show authority for the dischargers being within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Tribe or federal government.'' 
``We feel South Dakota has demonstrated its intent and ability to administer programs fairly in the entire state.
Therefore, the SDDENR should administer the NPDES program throughout the State. The department will need to work
closely with tribal governments. Splitting the non-Federal responsibilities could result in ineffective protection
of the waters of the state.'' 
A state agency expressed concern that the split in administering the program would cause confusion.

As noted in the public notice, EPA made the decision to withhold authorization to administer the NPDES program on ``Indian
Country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, which includes lands inside reservation boundaries and trust lands found
outside reservations. For the most part, these include nine Federal Indian reservations: 



1. Cheyenne River Indian Reservation 
2. Crow Creek Indian Reservation 
3. Flandreau Indian Reservation 
4. Lower Brule Indian Reservation 
5. Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 
6. Rosebud Indian Reservation (includes Todd County and portions of Millette and Gregory Counties) 
7. Sisseton Indian Reservation 
8. Standing Rock Indian Reservation 
9. Yankton Indian Reservation. 



This issue was deferred until a satisfactory demonstration of jurisdiction over Indian Country is made by the State
of South Dakota or another governmental entity. Otherwise, delegation of any part of the program would have to be held
up pending a lengthy resolution of this complicated issue. 
While a number of comments were received regarding jurisdiction, this issue is deferred until such time as an appropriate
analysis is made of the State's authority to assert jurisdiction over lands for which EPA is retaining jurisdiction.
EPA will specifically mail copies of public notices of future assertions to those who provided comments, so they may
make their comments during the appropriate public comment period. 
It should be noted that EPA has prepared a list of NPDES-permitted facilities which will continue to be administered
by EPA. Operators or owners of facilities subject to the NPDES program which are located on these lands should continue
to send original or renewal permit applications to EPA. They will be notified of this at the time all permittees are
notified of the program authorization decision. Persons with questions as to whether their facilities may be in Indian
Country are advised to consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the EPA. 


V. Pretreatment Program 


A state pretreatment program must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 403.10(f) before being approved for program administration
by the EPA. Under 40 CFR 403.10(f)(1)(i) and 403.3(j), an approved state program must have the authority to require
industrial users to comply with pretreatment standards for specific industrial subcategories, as established
by EPA regulations in 40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, ``Effluent Guidelines and Standards.'' When South Dakota submitted
its proposed program to EPA, subchapter N had not been incorporated into the State program. However, incorporation
was approved at the July 28, 1993, public hearing of South Dakota Water Management Board and became effective on September
5, 1993. 


A. Comments Regarding the Pretreatment Program

<TEXT>
 

One commenter, a pretreatment program manager, expressed concerns and raised questions regarding the clarity of
the pretreatment program procedures and the level of resources needed by the DENR to administer the pretreatment
program: 

``1. I feel DENR must elaborate and develop a procedure for entering into a joint powers agreement with a municipality
in order for DENR to run a municipal pretreatment program. There is nothing in the submission that indicates the extent
to which DENR will administer the program, especially if a large municipality requests the Department run their program.


2. Does DENR have the authority to flatly refuse to administer a municipal pretreatment program? 

3. If DENR issues a SWD Permit to a POTW and mandates the development of a pretreatment program, can the POTW in turn request
the State to administer the program? If so, what are the procedures for requesting that DENR administer the program?


4. Assuming the State becomes delegated, what is the timeframe for previously approved pretreatment programs to
submit notice to the DENR that the POTW wishes to continue administering the program? 

5. I honestly feel that if ONE of the larger POTW's [sic] request that DENR administer their pretreatment program,
along with all of the other smaller POTW pretreatment responsibilities the state will assume, the Department will
not have enough personnel to adequately administer this program.'' 

A second commenter proposed that the following be added to the administrative rules: 

``74:03:26_A POTW that intends to discharge wastewater to a separate POTW which is under a different authority must
submit a request for approval to the Secretary at least 90 days prior to discharge. The Secretary must evaluate the
impact of industrial user wastes on contributing POTW and receiving POTW. 

The Secretary may choose one of the following options to protect both POTWs from significant industrial user discharges:


(1) Require contributing jurisdiction to establish a Pretreatment Program in accordance to [sic] the requirements
in 40 CFR Part 403.8(a) and the State provide direct oversight over program. 

(2) State implement a POTW Pretreatment Program in lieu of the contributing jurisdiction as set forth in 
40 CFR Part 403.8(e). 

(3) Control all significant industrial users in the contributing jurisdiction directly by conditions established
in 74:03:26:03 to 74:03:26:14 and the State of SD Pretreatment Program.'' 



B. EPA's Response to Comments 



ARSD Section 74:03:26:02 and Section V of the Program Description provide for development of a joint powers agreement
in cases where a POTW required to develop a pretreatment program has requested the DENR to assume pretreatment program
requirements. This request is to be made within 30 days of notification that the State has been delegated the pretreatment
program or within 30 days of the facility being notified that it is required to develop a pretreatment program. In the
latter case, this notification would be made either at the time of issuance of an NPDES permit with such a requirement
or the conclusion of an enforcement action imposing such a requirement. 

EPA believes that any POTW can request that the State assume responsibility for a local pretreatment program, subject
to implementation of an agreed-upon joint powers agreement. It appears that the DENR may refuse to administer a program
only if no joint powers agreement is developed within forty-five days after notification of intent by the POTW. 

EPA agrees that the DENR should provide more detailed instructions to POTWs regarding the joint powers agreement
process. This can be done at the time the POTW requests the DENR to administer its pretreatment program, since the procedures
may vary somewhat depending on the extent and content of local legal authorities and procedures at each facility when
the request is received. 

The DENR will be required upon authorization to supply whatever resources are necessary to ensure that all pretreatment
program activities are fully implemented and enforced. DENR staff are knowledgeable about the resources required
to implement a program. SDCL 34A-2-120 provides for the DENR to collect annual fees from, not only the POTW
for which it administers the pretreatment program ($35,000), but each pretreatment industrial 
user ($600 plus up to $1,600 per process line for analytical testing). These fees, plus any legislative appropriations,
would be the financial basis for DENR administering the overall state pretreatment program and individual programs
with which it has joint powers agreements. 

Regarding the proposed rule changes, EPA finds additional rules are not needed to provide the State the authority
to require a POTW to develop a pretreatment program or to request that the DENR administer the program in lieu of the
POTW. The State is not required to offer POTWs the option to develop or have programs developed at POTWs which do not
meet the criteria contained in 40 CFR 403.8(a), as seems to be suggested by the second commenter's proposed rules.




Conclusion 



The pretreatment program described adequately meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403.10(f). The Program Description
outlines the process for joint powers agreements. EPA recognizes that the specific steps for developing joint powers
agreements between the DENR and an individual POTW may vary according to the situation at each municipality. EPA will
continue to play a significant review and oversight role in the development and implementation of joint powers agreements.

VI. Endangered Species Act 



In our August 25, 1993 letter to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), EPA initiated informal consultation
under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on EPA's proposal to authorize the DENR to administer the NPDES
Program under section 402 of the Clean Water Act in South Dakota. The FWS responded to EPA on October 20, 1993. EPA responded
to that letter with a letter on November 19, 1993 describing permitting and variance procedures and providing a biological
assessment of the impact of program authorization on endangered and threatened species in South Dakota delineated
in the FWS October 20th letter. The November 19th letter also stated that EPA believed that the delegation would have
no effect on the listed species. Responding in its November 30, 1993 letter to the EPA, the FWS indicated that it could
concur with our no adverse effect finding if EPA agreed to four conditions. 

EPA and DENR staff met with staff at the FWS South Dakota Field Office in Pierre to discuss the conditions. Based on that
meeting, the EPA and DENR agreed to these conditions, as follows. FWS concurred on EPA's Finding of No Adverse Affect
on December 15, 1993. The MOA between EPA and South Dakota on the administration of the South Dakota NPDES program addressed
these conditions. 

1. In each individual public notice or variance, the State shall make an initial determination of effect on all federally
listed endangered and threatened species that may occur in the project area of influence. 

 This information will be provided to the Service as well as to the EPA with sufficient time to review and, if necessary,
provide comments, as reflected in the Memorandum of Agreement signed between EPA and the State of South Dakota. 
 The State will communicate with the Service, on a periodic basis, on the permits that it will be issuing. The
Service will work with the State to identify those permits for which there are species in the project area. 

2. If it is determined by the State that the individual permit or variance to the permit provided to the Service may adversely
affect any federally listed and/or proposed endangered and threatened species, the State will work with the Service
to eliminate the adverse affect. 

3. If the Service does not concur with the State's ``no affect'' determination, the State will work with the Service
to eliminate the adverse effect. 

4. If any adverse effects cannot be eliminated, the permit application or variance will be held in abeyance and the
EPA, with their oversight responsibilities, will require consultation with the Service, after EPA has completed
the formal objection process and the permit has reverted to EPA for issuance. 



A. Comments Concerning Information Needed and the Consultation Process

One environmental organization urged EPA to engage in formal consultation with the FWS pursuant to Section 7 of the
Endangered Species Act. Another environmental group questioned whether EPA had complied with requirements to consult
with the FWS and with the State Game, Fish, and Parks Department. 



B. EPA's Response to Comments 



The EPA successfully completed informal consultation with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, as described above.
Therefore, there was no need to engage in the formal consultation process. 



VII. Overall Delegation Issues 



EPA received a number of public comments regarding the overall capability and intent of the DENR to administer an authorized
NPDES program. 



A. Comments Regarding the Benefits of Delegation 



1. Many commenters praised the capabilities, competency, knowledge, and past performance of the DENR staff. 

``* * * we have relied on the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural resources
as a resource for questions and concerns we have had with the NPDES program. We have found the DENR to be staffed by a group
of well-informed professionals dedicated to the enhancement of water quality. Their guidance and advice have always
been valuable * * *.'' 

``The DENR has established itself as a very competent department and has a very positive working relationship with
a variety of industries within the state. The DENR will be very effective in administering and enforcing the NPDES
program for the State of South Dakota * * * we haven't always agreed with DENR on our positions, but let
me say clearly we have always been treated very fairly.'' ``To me, the State seems very capable of making decisions
and taking action, while at the Federal level, response does not occur with promptness.'' 

``We are aware of the efforts the Department made prior to and during the 1992 State Legislative session to secure funding
needed to upgrade staff capability to take over management of the NPDES program.'' 

``* * * environmental regulations are best administered at the state level. State administration
provides both the permittee and the regulator better opportunity for face to face communication and for better understanding
of the specifics of an operation through regular inspections. Administration and enforcement are both enhanced
by having the regulators in close proximity to the regulated facilities.'' 

2. Numerous commenters emphasized the advantages of regulation by an agency actually in the State. Comments included
the following: 

``EPA technical staff are normally available by phone only, while state staff are frequent visitors to the area and
are available for valuable on-site assistance * * *. Our experience in working with [a delegated
state regarding other facilities] has been one where positive environmental benefits have been achieved in an efficient,
timely manner. We deal directly and in person with all the regulatory people involved, which drastically reduces
the questions of interpretation, improves timeliness of permit compliance and in the end provides quicker, effective
solutions to environmental problems.'' 

``I believe that delegation of the NPDES program for regulating the discharges of pollutants into waters within the
State will mean a more effective operation on both a programmatic and cost basis.'' 

``We are as concerned for the environment of our employees as much as anyone else is, but we have a desire for cooperation
rather than dictation.'' 

``I believe a program administered by the state of South Dakota, with regional offices in efforts to help industry
clean up our environment, should we be polluting it, would be a tremendous benefit to all manufacturers.'' 

``Having the answers in state and accountable to South Dakotans will enhance businesses' ability to comply.'' 

``[The State Feedlot Program Regulation Review] * * *. Committee concluded that State management
of the NPDES program was needed to accomplish effective regulation of feedlot wastes in South Dakota.'' 

``The National Performance Review recently cited recommendations to create a system of program delivery that works
better and costs less. The very first recommendation (EPA01) specifically states: `Improve Environmental Protection
Through Increased Flexibility for Local Government'. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has a real
opportunity today to act on this recommendation by approving South Dakota's application!'' 

``There are several reasons why the Legislature supported this [Second Century Environmental Protection] Act:


 


_State administration of the federal program would enhance economic development; 

_Improved coordination would exist between local and state governmental agencies; and 

_The state would better safeguard the public health, safety, welfare and the environment of this state through a customer
service approach.''

B. Comments Opposing Authorization 


A number of commenters identified problems associated with delegation, both in public participation issues and
in other areas: 
``If [program authorization] were to happen, South Dakota citizens, although they might not know it, would be without
protection.'' 
``DENR's activities last year demonstrate clearly the agency's tendency toward advocacy for, rather than regulation
of, the entities it is, by law, required to oversee * * *. [This group] seeks denial of state delegation
until the philosophy of DENR changes from that of advocate for the regulated community to one of regulator.'' An environmental
group criticized the state's commitment to enforcement. 
An environmental group requested that EPA require monitoring data to be submitted and housed at DENR. They also suggested
that issued and denied permits require equivalent levels of clearances. 


C. EPA's Response to Comments on Overall Authorization Issues 


EPA noted and considered all public comments considering the overall advantages and disadvantages of approving
the NPDES program administration by the State of South Dakota. 
Many of the comments reflected the advantage of State program approval which the Clean Water Act envisioned: the program
can be administered more effectively closer to the regulated community when the agency and its staff are competent
and committed to protecting the environment and public health. 
Resources to be used meet the minimum requirements of the NPDES program as it now exists. The State would be responsible
for devoting the resources needed to maintain this program and implement additional requirements, as they occur.

EPA's responses to public participation issues are found under the sections on ``Unsigned Complaints'' and ``Citizen
Intervention''. 
EPA typically does not require submission of monitoring data other than discharge monitoring reports (DMRs) when
it administers the NPDES program in a state. Therefore, it does not require an approved state to do so. 
It appears that there are equivalent levels of clearance for permit issuance and denial. In both cases, the Secretary
makes that decision. This is noted in the flow chart on page 9 of the Program Description. 


Conclusion 


The State of South Dakota has demonstrated that it adequately meets the requirements for program authorization as
defined in the Clean Water Act, 40 CFR part 123, and 40 CFR part 403. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service concurred with
the EPA ``no adverse affect'' determination regarding program authorization. The State Historic Preservation
Office concurred with the EPA ``no effect'' determination. This authorization does not include the sludge management
program. 
At this time, EPA is withholding authorization to administer the NPDES program on Indian Country located within South
Dakota, including lands for which there is significant controversy over whether or not the land is Indian Country.



Federal Register Notice of Approval of State NPDES Programs or Modifications 


EPA must provide 

Federal Register

 notice of any action by the Agency approving or modifying a State NPDES program. The following table will provide the
public with an up-to-date list of the status of NPDES permitting authority throughout the country. Today's 

Federal Register

 notice is to announce the approval of South Dakota's authority to administer the NPDES permit program, including
regulation of federal facilities and issuance of general permits and to administer the pretreatment program.

Review Under Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of entities. The proposed approval of the South Dakota NPDES
program does not alter the regulatory control over any industrial category. No new substantive requirements are
established by this action. Therefore, because this notice does not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not needed. 

On October 12, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget exempted this Agency action from the requirements of Executive
Order 12866.

<DOCTITLE>Ceres Marine Terminal, Inc. v. Maryland Port Administration; Filing of Complaint and Assignment</DOCTITLE>




Notice is given that a complaint filed by Ceres Marine Terminal, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Maryland Port Administration
(``Respondent'') was served January 6, 1994. Complainant alleges that Respondent has violated sections 16 and 17
of the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. 815 and 816, and sections 10 (b)(11), (b)(12), (d)(1) and (d)(3) of the Shipping
Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app   1709 (b)(11), (b)(12), (d)(1) and (d)(3) by granting more favorable lease
terms to other terminals with respect to terminal services and barge services, providing superior crane service
to another terminal while failing to provide adequate crane service to Complainant, refusing to permit Complainant
to install one of its own cranes, and denying equivalent lease terms to Complainant.

This proceeding has been assigned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held,
shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given
by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include
oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the Presiding Officer only upon proper showing that there
are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions,
or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary
for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
Presiding Officer in this proceeding shall be issued by January 6, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall
be issued by May 8, 1995.

Grants for Injury Prevention Research for Violence Against Women; Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994 


Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces that applications are being accepted for Injury Prevention
Research Grants for Violence Against Women. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health
promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity,
mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the area of Violent and Abusive Behavior.
(For ordering a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the Section Where To Obtain Additional Information.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under sections 301 and 391 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 and 280b). Program
regulations are set forth in title 42 of the CFR part 52. 


Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants include all non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus state, tribal, and local health
departments and other state, tribal, and local governmental agencies, universities, colleges, research institutions,
and other public and private organizations, including small, minority and/or woman-owned businesses are eligible
for these research grants. Current holders of CDC injury control research projects are eligible to apply. 



Availability of Funds 


Approximately $2.0 million is projected to be available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 5 to 9 grants. The amount of
funding actually available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including
both direct and indirect costs). Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both
direct and indirect costs). Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period not to exceed 3
years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated
by investigators at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the achievement of workplan milestones reflected
in the continuation application, and the availability of Federal funds. In addition, continuation awards will be
eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs depending upon the availability of funds. 


Purpose 


The purposes of this program are: 
A. To build the scientific base for the prevention of injuries and deaths due to violence against women as delineated
in Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action. Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993;
Healthy People 2000; Violence in America: A Public Health Approach; Understanding and Preventing Violence; and
Injury Prevention: Meeting the Challenge (supplement to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, (Vol. 5, no.
3, 1989); 
B. To identify effective strategies to prevent injuries and deaths due to violence against women; 
C. To expand the development and evaluation of current and new intervention methods and strategies for the primary
prevention of violence against women; 
D. To encourage professionals from a wide spectrum of disciplines such as medicine, health care, public health, criminal
justice, behavioral and social sciences, and others to undertake research to prevent and control injuries that result
from violence against women. 


Program Requirements 


The following are applicant requirements: 
A. A principal investigator who has conducted research, published the findings, and has specific authority and responsibility
to carry out the proposed project.

B. Demonstrated experience in conducting, evaluating, and publishing injury control research on the applicant's
project team. 
C. Effective and well-defined working relationships within the performing organization and with outside entities
which will ensure implementation of the proposed activities. 
D. An explanation of how research findings could lead to the development of injury control interventions within 3-5
years of project start-up. Furthermore, how the research findings might be disseminated and implemented through
organizations (such as public health agencies) or systems, both public and private. 
E. The ability to carry out injury control research projects. 
F. The overall match between the applicant's proposed theme and research objectives, and the program priorities
as described under the heading ``Programmatic Interest'' and in Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action.
Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993; Healthy People 2000; Violence in America: A Public Health
Approach; Understanding and Preventing Violence; and Injury Prevention: Meeting the Challenge. 






Note: 

Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care services. Eligible applicants may enter
into contracts, including consortia agreements (as set forth in the PHS Grants Policy Statement) as necessary to
meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application. 


Programmatic Interests 


The grants should concentrate on the need to prevent the morbidity, mortality, and disability which result from violence
against women, in order to reduce the devastating social and economic impact on the nation. Applicants are encouraged
to propose research which either: (1) Rigorously evaluates the outcomes of violence prevention strategies currently
in use, or (2) identifies modifiable risk factors which can lead to the development of effective interventions. Examples
of possible projects listed under the priority areas below are by no means exhaustive, and innovative approaches
are encouraged. Because of time constraints, comments were not solicited from the general public regarding funding
priorities and special considerations. 
In prevention, there is specific interest in research that evaluates the effectiveness of interventions to prevent
injuries and deaths due to violence against women, or reduce their impact. There is also interest in research that
develops the basic sciences of injury control (i.e., social and behavioral sciences, and epidemiology). This research
might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing a specific intervention strategy. In addition,
there is a need to examine intervention strategies for which evidence of effectiveness is either sparse or totally
lacking. Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant potential for reducing morbidity, mortality,
disability, or cost. Special consideration will be given to grants which target populations at high risk for violence-related
injuries and their consequences, including adolescents, children, racial and ethnic minorities, urban residents,
and people with low incomes. 
Examples of strategies for preventing violence against women which need to be rigorously evaluated for impact on
violent outcomes include: 
 Establishing protocols for early identification and referral of abuse victims in health settings (e.g.,
Are women who are identified as being physically or sexually abused through victim identification and referral protocols
in hospital emergency departments, substance abuse and mental health centers, STD clinics, or prenatal care clinics
less likely than others to experience future abuse? Do home health visits reduce partner abuse in targeted families
and, as a consequence, reduce the likelihood that children will witness such violence?); 
 Batterer treatment programs; 
 Alcohol and drug abuse treatment services for batterers and victims in tandem with batterer treatment programs;

 Public information and awareness campaigns to change attitudes and beliefs which perpetuate violence against
women (e.g., Can well-designed and administered public awareness campaigns change knowledge and attitudes that
perpetuate violence against women? Are hotlines that provide crisis intervention counseling an effective mechanism
for increasing the use of available services and programs?)

<TEXT>
 

In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks
of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions for violence against women. Examples of potentially
modifiable risk factors which should be examined for each area are listed below: 

 Attitudes and beliefs which influence violent behavior against women (e.g., Are boys and men who hold attitudes
conducive to violence against women more likely to be violent towards women? What role does culture play in perpetuating
these attitudes?); 

 The impact of early childhood experiences of violence (either as a witness or victim of violence) upon the tendency
to develop violent behavior patterns in adulthood (e.g., What childhood experiences mitigate the harmful effects
on children of witnessing violent acts against women? What role does past exposure to varying forms of violence play
in repeated victimization?); 

 The role of alcohol and other drugs among batterers and their victims; 

 Factors in a dating relationship which precipitate violent behavior (e.g., Are young men who commit violent
acts against a date likely to continue these behaviors?); 

 Factors which precipitate battering during pregnancy. 

Also of programmatic interest is epidemiologic research having as its focus the development of improved methods
for and the evaluation of injury surveillance systems that accurately quantify the incidence and severity of injuries
that result from violence against women (e.g., emergency department-based surveillance of injuries due to violence
against women). Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of violence against women, from a social,
physical, and psychological perspective (e.g., How does violence against women affect productivity in the workplace?
How does such violence affect the cost of health care in general?).

Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an intervention(s) that addresses
violence against women. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in,
A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR-3, pages 5-11). (To receive information on these reports
see the section Where To Obtain Additional Information.) 



Evaluation Criteria 



Upon receipt, applications will be screened by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the
previous heading, Program Requirements (A-F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive
will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive
may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient
technical and scientific merit to warrant further review; the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications
judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing
for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review
process. The primary review will be a peer evaluation by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) of the
scientific and technical merit of the application. The final review will be conducted by the CDC Advisory Committee
for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC), which will consider the results of the peer review together with program
need and relevance. Funding decisions will be made by the Director, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control
(NCIPC), based on merit and priority score ranking by the IRGRC, program review by the ACIPC, and the availability
of funds. 

A. The first review will be a peer review to be conducted on all applications. Factors to be considered will include:


1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad long-term objectives, the intended accomplishment
of the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested; 

2. The background of the proposal, i.e., the basis for the present proposal, the critical evaluation of existing knowledge,
and specific identification of the injury control knowledge gaps which the proposal is intended to fill; 

3. The significance and originality from a scientific or technical standpoint of the specific aims of the proposed
research, including the adequacy of the theoretical and conceptual framework for the research;

4. For competitive renewal and supplemental applications, the progress made during the prior project period. For
new applications, (optional) the progress of preliminary studies pertinent to the application. 

5. The adequacy of the proposed research design, approaches, and methodology to carry out the research, including
quality assurance procedures, plan for data management, and statistical analysis plan. 

6. The extent to which the evaluation plan will allow for the measurement of progress toward the achievement of the
stated objectives. 

7. Qualifications, adequacy, and appropriateness of personnel to accomplish the proposed activities. 

8. The degree of commitment and cooperation of other interested parties (as evidenced by letters detailing the nature
and extent of the involvement). 

9. The reasonableness of the proposed budget to the proposed research and demonstration program. 

10. Adequacy of existing and proposed facilities and resources. 

B. The second review will be conducted by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control. The factors to
be considered will include: 

1. The results of the peer review. 

2. The significance of the proposed activities in relation to the objectives stated in Injury Control in the 1990s:
A National Plan for Action. Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993; Healthy People 2000; Violence
in America: A Public Health Approach; Understanding and Preventing Violence; and Injury Prevention: Meeting the
Challenge. 

3. National needs. 

4. Overall distribution among: 

 The major disciplines of violence-related injury prevention: social and behavioral sciences, and epidemiology;


 Populations addressed (e.g., adolescents, minorities, the elderly, urban, rural); and 

5. Budgetary considerations (e.g., preference may be given to applicants who submit proposals requesting funding
for research projects of one to two years) . 

C. Continued funding. Continuation awards made after FY 1994, but within the project period, will be made on the basis
of the availability of funds and the following criteria: 

1. The accomplishments reflected in the progress report of the continuation application indicate that the applicant
is meeting previously stated objectives or milestones contained in the project's annual workplan and satisfactory
progress demonstrated through monitoring presentations or work-in-progress workshops; 

2. The objectives for the new budget period are realistic, specific, and measurable; 

3. The methods described will clearly lead to achievement of these objectives; 

4. The evaluation plan will allow management to monitor whether the methods are effective; and 

5. The budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable and consistent with the intended use
of grant funds. 

D. Supplementary funding. Competing Supplemental grant awards may be made when funds are available, to support research
work or activities not previously approved by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC). Applications
should be clearly labelled to denote their status as requesting supplemental funding support. These applications
will be reviewed by the IRGRC and the secondary review group.

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Ethylene
Glycol</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of Ethylene Glycol, a major constituent of motor vehicle antifreeze-coolant fluids and
also in other commercial products including hydraulic brake fluids, adhesives, printer's inks, and wood stains.
It is also used in the manufacturer of polyester films and fibers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) solid state resins,
plasticizers, elastomers, cellophane, and other products.

Two year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering ethylene glycol in the diet of 60
male mice (0, 6,200, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm) and 60 female mice (0, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm) for up to 103 weeks.
These concentrations correspond to daily doses of approximately 1,500, 3,000, or 6,000 mg/kg body weight for male
mice and 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 mg/kg for females.

Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity
 of ethylene glycol in male B6C3F1 mice receiving 6,250, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm, or in female B6C3F1 mice receiving 12,500,
25,000, or 50,000 ppm. Administration of ethylene glycol resulted in hepatocellular hyaline degeneration in male
mice fed diets containing 12,500 or 25,000 ppm and in female mice fed diets containing 50,000 ppm. An increased incidence
of medial hyperplasia of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles occurred in female mice fed diets containing 12,500,
25,000, or 50,000 ppm ethylene glycol.





Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O. Box 12233,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541-3419.

Copies of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Ethylene Glycol (Cas No. 107-21-1) in B6C3F1 Mice

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Mercuric
Chloride</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of Mercuric Chloride, an inorganic compound that has been used in agriculture as a fungicide,
in medicine as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant, and in chemistry as an intermediate in the production of other
mercury compounds. 

Two-year toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering to groups of 60 rats of each sex
0, 2.5, or 5 mg mercuric chloride/kg body weight and to groups of 60 mice of each sex 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg in deionized water
by gavage 5 days per week for 2 years. 

Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
 of mercuric chloride in male F344 rats based on the increased incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach.
Marginally increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas may have been related to mercuric
chloride exposure. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in female F344 rats
based on two squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity
of mercuric chloride in male B6C3F1 mice based on the occurrences of two renal tubule adenomas and one renal tubule
adenocarcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of mercuric chloride in female B6C3F1 mice receiving
5 or 10 mg/kg.





Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O. Box 12233,

The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of p-Nitrophenol used in the production of acetaminophen, methyl and ethyl parathion insecticides,
fungicides, and dyestuffs.
 
Eighteen-month toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by applying p-Nitrophenol in acetone to the
intrascapular skin of groups of 60 Swiss-Webster mice of each sex. Doses of 0, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg p-Nitrophenol were
administered to mice 3 days per week for 78 weeks. 
 
Under the conditions of these 18-month dermal studies there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity

Intent To Close to Public Entry Public Lands To Protect Endangered Species Until a Suitable Permit System Is Implemented



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management; Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of closure of public entry to public lands.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that portions of the Public Lands along the Gila River below Coolidge Dam in Gila County, Arizona
will be closed to all forms of boating and rafting. The Gila River in this area is jointly administered by the Bureau
and the San Carlos Indian Reservation. This closure will not apply to emergency response agencies conducting official
business. This use restriction covers the Gila River as it crosses Public Lands from T. 3 S., R. 18 E., Section 17, downstream
to the confluence of Mescal Creek and the Gila River in T. 3 S., R. 17 E., Section 29, G & SR Meridian, Arizona.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of this use restriction is to provide protection for nesting bald eagles 

Haliaeetus leucocephalus. 

In past years, the Gila River was not navigable in this area due to water hazards. Recent flooding has opened up the river
channel and facilitated a proliferation of rafting and boating in the area. The bald eagle nest is low to the ground
and immediately adjacent to the river channel making it susceptible to human disturbance. To comply with the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended, the Bureau must not allow actions that may result in ``take'' of an endangered species
without being permitted according to Section 7 of the Act. Failure by the Bureau to control public access to this area
may result in disturbance to the nesting bald eagles and a violation of the Act. The Bureau will consult with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service when a permit system is established jointly with the San Carlos Indian Reservation.



Order




Notice is hereby given that effective on the date of signature by the authorized officer of this notice, the following
use restriction will be in effect on the Gila River Public Lands below Coolidge Dam until July 1, 1994, or until an opening
notice is published.


1. No person may boat, raft or float on the Gila River on Public Lands described below. Emergency response agencies
on official business will be exempt from this order.

supplementary information:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published two notices in the 

Federal Register

 of November 5, 1993, announcing the receipt of petitions to impose a moratorium on the imports of wild birds from Indonesia
and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal into the United States, pursuant to the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (58 FR 59061
and 58 FR 59063). The petitions were found to present sufficient information indicating that imposing a moratorium
on the imports of wild birds from Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal may be warranted under the Act. The Service
received requests in writing from the following to extend the comment period: Government of Indonesia, Government
of S&eacute;n&eacute;gal, Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, and American Federation of Aviculture. In particular,
the Governments of Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal requested additional time to fully review the petitions
and prepare a response. Those written requests were received by the Service during the period of December 23-27,
1993. The Service considers these requests warranted, and through the issuance of this notice, extends the comment
period on both of these petitions an additional 90 days, in order to receive as complete information as is possible
concerning the status of wild bird species in both Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal. 

 

Public Comments Solicited 

 

The Service intends that any final decision resulting from these petitions will be as accurate and as effective as
possible. Therefore, any comments or data from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific
or conservation communities, trade organizations, or any other interested party concerning any aspect of the wild
bird trade in Indonesia and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal are hereby solicited. 

 Author: The author of this notice is Dr. Susan S. Lieberman, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Management Authority.

Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 subpart F_Exempt Abandonments
to abandon approximately a 1.5

#

 mile line of railroad between milepost 0.0

#

 and milepost 1.5

#

, in Windber, in Somerset County, PA. 

Conrail has certified that: (1) no local or overhead traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) no formal
complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such
user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District
Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (3) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7
(environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper
publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under
Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately
protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 

Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on February 10, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

2

 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29

Consolidated Rail Corporation, Two Commerce Square, 2001 Market Street, P.O. Box 41416, Philadelphia, PA 19101-1416.

ab initio

. 

Conrail has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment
and historic resources. The Section of Energy and Environment (SEE) will issue an environmental assessment (EA)
by January 14, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEE (room 3219, Interstate Commerce
Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEE, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on
environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public.


Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision. 






Decided: 

January 6, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Report of Computer Matching Program Between Department of Labor and Department of Health and Human Services, Social
Security Administration</DOCTITLE>



Participating agencies: 

The participating agencies in this computer matching program are the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,
Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration (SSA).
This Notice is published as required by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended. A new
written agreement for this long-standing computer matching program recently has been approved by both the Department
of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services Data Integrity Boards. 



Purpose of match: 

DOL will conduct a computer matching program of DOL and SSA records of Black Lung benefit recipients in order to detect
individuals who might improperly receive dual Black Lung benefits from SSA and DOL. When a verified match occurs,
the case will be referred to the proper DOL office for development to assure the validity of the match and to make any
required benefit adjustments. The SSA data will contain the date of death of SSA beneficiaries. This information
will help to minimize those cases in which benefit payments are made to deceased beneficiaries, by identifying a DOL
beneficiary who has died, but DOL has not been notified of the death. The SSA data also will assist DOL in properly referring
inquiries and correspondence received at DOL regarding SSA-only Black Lung beneficiaries. 



Authority for conducting the matching program: 

Title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, 30 U.S.C. 901, et seq.



Categories of records and individuals covered: 

SSA, as the source agency, will provide DOL with its Black Lung Payment System, HHS/SSA/OSR 09-60-0045,
(52 FR 9543, March 25, 1987), which will be matched with DOL's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs' Black Lung
Benefit Payment records contained in DOL/ESA-30 (55 FR 7131, February 28, 1990). The individuals covered will
be DOL and SSA Black Lung beneficiaries. 



Inclusive dates of the matching program: 

The Matching program will begin either 30 days after the publication date of this Notice, or 30 days after a copy of the
written agreement for this matching program is sent to the Chairman of the Committee on Government Affairs of the U.S.
Senate, to the Chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, and to the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget, whichever is later. The matching program will continue for 18 months from the beginning date and may be
extended for an additional 12 months thereafter. 



Address for receipt of public comment: 

Lawrence W. Rogers, Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,
DC 20210. Telephone: (202) 219-7503.

<DOCTITLE>Petitions for Modification </DOCTITLE>



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 



1. New Warwick Mining Company 



[Docket No. M-93-323-C] 



New Warwick Mining Company, R.D. 1, Box 167A, Mount Morris, Pennsylvania 15349 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its Warwick Mine (I.D. No. 36-02374) located in Greene County,
Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner
proposes to establish evaluations points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected areas. The
petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would
the mandatory standard. 



2. Costain Coal, Inc. 



[Docket No. M-93-324-C] 



Costain Coal, Inc., P.O. Box 289, Sturgis, Kentucky 42459-0289 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b) (weekly examination) to its Baker Mine (I.D. No. 15-14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky.
The petitioner requests that the minimum volume of air reaching the inby monitoring point be 5,000 cubic feet per minute.
In addition, the petitioner proposes to physically examine the affected areas weekly rather than daily because the
mine wide atmospheric monitoring system, with a proposed additional sensor to measure air velocity, would provide
the necessary monitoring. This petition modifies a Decision and Order on a previous petition, docket number M-92-94-C.
The petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would not result in a diminution of safety to the miners.




3. Consolidation Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-93-325-C] 



Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.343(b) (underground shops) to its Loveridge No. 22 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01433)
located in Marion County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to ventilate the underground motor barn with intake
air that is coursed through the affected air course directly into a return air course and that is not used to ventilate
working places; and to establish check points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected area on
a weekly basis. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



4. North Mountain Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-93-326-C] 



North Mountain Coal Company, R.D. #1, Box 32A, Dornsife, Pennsylvania 17823 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1002-1(a) (location of other electric equipment; requirements for permissibility) to its West
Side South Dip (I.D. No. 36-07681) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes
to use nonpermissible electric equipment within 150 feet of the pillar line and to suspend equipment 
operation anytime the methane concentration at the equipment reaches 0.5 percent either during operation or a preshift
examination. 



5. McElroy Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-93-327-C] 



McElroy Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition to modify
the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its McElroy Mine (I.D. No. 46-01437) located
in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof conditions, certain areas of the return air course cannot
be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points at specific locations and to have a certified
person monitor for methane and the quantity and quality of air at these evaluation points on a weekly basis and record
the results in a book kept on the surface. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide
at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



6. Sonora Mining Corporation 



[Docket No. M-93-13-M] 



Sonora Mining Corporation, P.O. Box 1418, Jamestown, California 95327 has filed a petition to modify the application

of 30 CFR 56.9300 (berms or guardrails) to its Jamestown Mine (I.D. No. 04-04695) located in Tuolumne County,
California. The petitioner proposes to eliminate the use of berms during construction of the final lift on the tailings
dam and place material on the dam in one-foot compact layers in order to comply with the California State Division of
Dam Safety. The petitioner states that the height of the dam (200
') has reached a point where the width on top will not allow enough room for scrapers to travel and dump their loads
if berms are used. In addition, the petitioner states that to maintain a safe work environment, mobile equipment that
would work on top would drive forward only. 



Request for Comments 



Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments. These comments must be filed with the Office
of Standards, Regulations and Variances, Mine Safety and Health Administration, room 627, 4015 Wilson Boulevard,
Arlington, Virginia 22203. All comments must be postmarked or received in that office on or before February 10, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Company, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and
Finding of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>
 
 
 


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an one-time exemption from the
requirements of section III.A.5(b)(2) of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 issued to the Carolina Power & Light Company
(the licensee), for the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP), Unit 1 and 2, located in Brunswick County, North Carolina.

 


Environmental Assessment 
 


Identification of Proposed Action 
 


The proposed action would grant a one-time partial exemption from the schedular requirement in section III.A.5(b)(2)
of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, which requires a Type A test to be performed at each plant shutdown for refueling until
two consecutive Type A tests meet the acceptance criteria in section III.A.5(b). This exemption would allow the licensee
to return the BSEP to a normal testing frequency. Presently, both BSEP units are in the accelerated testing condition
of section III.A.5(b)(2) due to the as-found testing failures which were within L

a 

leakage limits but exceeded the 0.75 L

a

 limit. For Type A (containment integrate leak rate) tests conducted at peak pressure, the measured leakage rate,
L

am

, must be less than 75 percent of the maximum allowable leakage rate, L

a

, measured at the calculated peak containment internal pressure, P

a

. These terms are defined in section II of appendix J. In accordance with section III.A.6(b) of appendix J, if subsequently
two consecutive Type A tests for a unit should fail to meet the acceptance criterion, the accelerated test frequency
will be resumed. The next Unit 1 Type A test will be conducted during the Reload 9 outage, scheduled for March 1995, and
the next Unit 2 Type A test will be conducted during the Reload 12 outage, scheduled for March 1997. 
 
The proposed action is in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12, Specific Exemptions, and is based upon the information provided
to the Commission in the licensee's request for exemption dated October 19, 1993. 
 


The Need for the Proposed Action 
 


The proposed exemption is needed to avoid outage extensions and the increased outage costs while the tests for the
accelerated Type A containment leakage rate are being conducted. Granting of the exemption would return both BSEP
units to a normal test frequency. The exemption would also minimize subjecting the drywell to additional structural
stresses during the Type A tests. 
 


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 
 


The Commission's staff has determined that (a) the granting of the proposed exemption would not significantly increase
the probability or amount of expected containment leakage and (b) the integrity of the containment would be maintained.
Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased, nor would the post-accident radiological releases
be greater than previously determined. The proposed exemption would not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents.
Therefore, the Commission's staff concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed exemption. 
 
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves a change to surveillance testing
schedular requirements. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated
with the proposed exemption. 
 


Alternatives to the Proposed Action 
 


Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed
action, any alternatives would have either no or greater environmental impact. 
 
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts
attributed to this facility but could result in an increased frequency for Type A tests. This would result in the expenditure
of resources without any compensating benefit. 
 


Alternative Use of Resources 
 


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated January 1974. 
 


Agencies and Persons Consulted 
 


The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. 
 


Finding of No Significant Impact 
 


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. 
 
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. 
 
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for one-time partial exemption dated October 19,
1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120
L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public Document Room located at the University of North Carolina
at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297.

<DOCTITLE>Omaha Public Power District; Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-40, issued to Omaha Public Power District (OPPD/the licensee), for operation of Fort Calhoun
Station, Unit No. 1, located in Washington County, Nebraska.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed amendment would consist of revisions to 10 CFR part 20 references to recognize the new section numbers,
revise definitions to ensure consistency with 10 CFR part 20, and change administrative controls for reporting and
recordkeeping to maintain compliance with the new part 20. The changes would revise the limitations on concentrations
of radioactive material released in liquid effluents and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive
material released in gaseous effluents and reflect the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 10.106 requirements to the new
10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the licensee's application for amendment dated May 21, 1993, as supplemented
September 10, 1993, implementing the new 10 CFR part 20.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed revision, in regards to the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TSs)
as a dose rate to the maximally exposed member of the public, will not increase the types or amounts of effluents that
may be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the
Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed
amendment.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. 



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed
amendment to the TSs, any alternative to the amendment will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or will have greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment.
This would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
(FES) related to the operation of the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, dated August 1972.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed license amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated May 21, 1993, as supplemented
September 10, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public Document Room located at the W. Dale Clark Library, 215 South 15th
Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102.

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Company, Surry Power Station, Units 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of
No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-32 and DPR-37 issued to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Surry Power Station, Units 1 and 2 located in Surry County, Virginia.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would revise the limitations on concentrations of radioactive material released in liquid effluents
and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in gaseous effluents, and reflect
the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the
new 10 CFR Part 20. The review of an additional item, to revise the definition of ``UNRESTRICTED AREA'', was not completed
and consequently is not included in the amendment. It will be addressed by separate correspondence.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The proposed revision does not change the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS)
as a dose rate to the maximally exposed number of the public. Therefore, there will be no increase in the types or amounts
of effluents that may be released offsite, nor an increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures.
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated
with the proposed changes.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
impacts associated with the proposed changes.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission's staff has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the
proposed changes to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This
would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.



Alternative Use of Resources




This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in connection with the Final Environmental
Statement related to the operation of the Surry Power Station, Units 1 and 2, dated May and June 1972, respectively.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the State of Virginia regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments.

Based on the above environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further information with respect to this action, see the application dated July 16, 1993, as supplemented November
15, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating
to the Maintenance by Members of Certain Written Policies and Procedures</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership and who performs no other
function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting misuse of non-public information.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of the basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposal is to amend Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership and who performs
no other function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting misuse of non-public information.
In its current form, Rule 4.18 requires all members to maintain and enforce written policies and procedures concerning
non-public information. Lessor members who have no other activities, however, do not conduct any securities business
in respect of their membership, and, according to the Exchange, are not required to register as broker-dealers under
section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under these circumstances, the Exchange believes there is no reason
to subject these members to the written policy and procedure requirements of Rule 4.18, which by their terms are meaningful
only to an ongoing securities business. Accordingly, Rule 4.18 is proposed to be amended to clarify that members who
perform no function in respect of their membership except as lessors do not have to establish, maintain or enforce
written policies and procedures precluding misuse of non-public information.
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect the public interest by eliminating unnecessary costs and burdens without impairing CBOE's
capacity to meet the requirements of the Act.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the
Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to that which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will:
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-93-58
and should be submitted by February 1, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Designated Reporting Authority for Interest Rate Options
</DOCTITLE>



January 5, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I
and II below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The CBOE proposes to designate in its rules the entities that report to the Exchange the current values and the exercise
settlement values of the interest rate measures underlying the interest rate options listed for trading on the Exchange.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change





In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change






The purpose of the proposal is to specify the entities that the CBOE has designated to report the current values and
the closing exercise settlement values of interest rate measures underlying CBOE's interest rate options. The CBOE
believes that the proposed amendment also conforms the procedures currently employed for determining current values
and closing exercise settlement values of its short-term interest rate options (``IRX'')
 with those procedures recently approved by the Commission for the listing and trading on the Exchange of options based
on the yields of specified U.S. Treasury notes and bonds (``Long-Term Measures'').







As amended, new Interpretation .01 to Rule 23.1 lists Telerate Inc. as the designated reporting authority of current
values used for intra-day options pricing purposes and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY'') as the designated
reporting authority of spot yields used for calculating the exercise settlement values of interest rate options.
 The Commission recently approved those designations in connection with the listing and trading of Long-Term Measures.
 The proposal makes those designations applicable to all interest rate options traded on the Exchange. 







In addition, the proposed amendment to Rule 23.1 specifies that the Exchange will use a backup polling procedure to
establish applicable underlying values for exercise settlement purposes on those occasions on the last trading
day prior to expiration of the interest rate option contracts that the FRBNY does not generate the required spot yields.
 This polling procedure will be uniform for all interest rate options traded on the Exchange.

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to enhance cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities,
and to protect investors.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds, as it did in approving these same pricing procedures for the Long-Term Measures,
that the CBOE proposal has been adequately designed to guard against unreliable or manipulated quotas.
 The CBOE has been obtaining quotes from Telerate for intra-day pricing of its interest rate options without generating
any concern with respect to unreliable or manipulated quotes. In this regard, the proposal merely codifies the Exchange's
intra-day pricing procedures currently in effect and which have previously been approved by the SEC for use with all
of the Exchange's interest rate options.








With respect to the CBOE's reliance on FRBNY spot yield quotes and the backup polling procedure when those quotes are
unavailable, the Commission finds as it did in approving the Long-Term Measures, that these procedures are more reliable
than the polling procedures currently employed for purposes of determining closing settlement values for the IRX
and the LTX option contracts.
 Therefore, the Commission believes it is appropriate to codify these procedures, making them applicable to all of
the Exchange's interest rate options.




The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to permit the Exchange to begin implementing these procedures with respect to the IRX contracts as soon as
possible in order to minimize any investor confusion that could arise from having varying procedures for determining
closing settlement values for different interest rate option contracts. Additionally, the Commission notes that
no comments were received prior to approval when these procedures were published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 with respect to the Long-Term Measures. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5)
and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.


IV. Solicitation of Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commisasion's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-93-53
and should be submitted by February 1, 1994.


It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-53) is hereby approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by
the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing of Regular and Long-Term Options on the Nasdaq 100
Index</DOCTITLE>



January 5, 1994.




I. Introduction



On September 22, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of index options on the Nasdaq 100 Index (``Nasdaq Index''
or ``Index'').
 The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33166 (November 8, 1993),
58 FR 60710 (November 17, 1993). No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves
the Exchange's proposal.








II. Description of Proposal



A. General



The CBOE proposes to trade options on the Nasdaq Index, a stock index calculated and maintained by the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. (``Nasdaq''), a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). The
CBOE also proposes to list long-term options (``LEAPS'') on the Index. Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in
addition to regular Index options traded on the Exchange.




B. Composition of the Index



The Index contains one hundred of the largest non-financial securities issued by U.S. issuers and traded on the Nasdaq
National Market. Nasdaq will use a capitalization-weighted method to calculate the Index.
 As of January 3, 1994 the Index was at 398.28.




As of October 25, 1993, the market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from a high of $26.8
billion to a low of $437 million, with the mean and median being $2.54 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The market
capitalization of all the stocks in the Index was $253.8 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks
in the Index ranged from a high of 536 million shares to a low of 15.1 million shares. The average price per share of the
stocks in the Index, for a six-month period between April 1, 1993 and September 1, 1993, ranged from a high of $103.29
to a low of $6.15. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the stocks in the Index, for the same six-month period,
ranged from a high of 2.853 million shares per day to a low of 10,579 shares per day, with the mean and median being 631,631
and 407,639 shares, respectively. Lastly, no one stock comprised more than 10.54% of the Index's total value and the
percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 33.27% of the Index's value. The percentage
weighting of the lowest weighted stock was 0.17% of the Index and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues
in the Index accounted for 1.12% of the Index's value.



C. Maintenance



The Index will be maintained by Nasdaq. Nasdaq has notified the CBOE that it recently updated the list of securities
comprising the Index and will continue to make revisions to the Index on an annual basis. Nasdaq also, in its discretion,
will make special adjustments to the securities comprising the Index to reflect such events as stock splits or reverse
splits, spinoffs, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and similar events, upon their occurrence.



D. Calculation of the Index



The Index will be calculated using a capitalization-weighting methodology. The representation of each security
in the Index will be proportional to the security's last sale price times the total number of shares outstanding, in
relation to the total market value of all of the securities in the Index. The level of the Index is calculated as follows:








The numerical value of the Index was established at 250 prior to the opening of the market on February 1, 1985. At the
close of the market on December 31, 1993, the Index was at 796.56. Then, effective January 3, 1994, the Index value was
halved, creating an Index level of 398.28 at the market opening on January 3, 1994. The Index is calculated and disseminated
every fifteen seconds to market information vendors. Nasdaq will also calculate the exercise settlement value for
each expiring series of Nasdaq Index options and make this value available to the CBOE for use by the Options Clearing
Corporation in effecting settlement of exercises and assignments of the options.

<DOCNO> FR940111-2-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940111-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Index value, for purposes of setting outstanding Index options contracts upon expiration, will be calculated
based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component stocks on the last trading day prior
to expiration.
 Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that value will be used as
the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts. If any of the component stocks do not open for trading
on the last trading day before expiration, then the last reported sale price of such security will be used in any case
where that security does not trade on that day.







E. Contract Specifications 



The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
 Standard options trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. New York time) will apply to the contracts. The Index multiplier
will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for full-value Index options with a duration of one year or less
to expiration.
 The Exchange intends to list up to three near-term calendar months and three additional calendar months at three month
intervals.
 As described in more detail below, the Exchange also intends to list Index LEAPS that will expire twelve to thirty-six
months from the date of their issuance. 








Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) will expire on the Saturday following the third
Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). Since options on the Index will settle based upon the opening
prices of the component stocks on the last trading day before expiration (normally a Friday), the last trading day
for an expiring Index option series will normally be the second to the last business day before expiration (normally
a Thursday).






F. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Nasdaq Index



The Exchange may list LEAPS that expire 12 to 36 months from date of issuance on the full-value Nasdaq Index or a reduced-value
Nasdaq Index that will be computed on one-tenth the value of the full-value Index.
 The current and closing Index value for reduced-value Nasdaq LEAPS will be computed by dividing the value of the full-value
Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, a Index value of 185.46 would
be 18.55 for the Index LEAPS and 185.43 would become 18.54. The reduced-value LEAPS will have a European-style exercise
and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all the Exchange's index options, including sales practice
rules, margin requirements and floor trading procedures. The strike price interval for the reduced-value Index
LEAPS will be no less than $2.50 instead of $5.00. 





The same Exchange rules which are applicable to the trading of full-value LEAPS will be applicable to the trading of
reduced-value Index LEAPS. For example, both full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS may expire from 12 to 36 months
from the date of issuance, and there may be up to six expiration months beyond one year to expiration. Moreover, either
full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS may be issued at six month intervals and new strike prices will either be near
or bracketing the current Index value. Strike price interval, bid/ask differential, and continuity rules will not
apply to the trading of the full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS until their time to expiration is less than 12 months.
The strike price interval for reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50, instead of $5.00 for full-value
Index LEAPS. Lastly, additional LEAPS series may be added when the value of the underlying Index increases or decreases
by ten to fifteen percent. 



G. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts 



Position limits for the Index options Index LEAPS will be set at no more than 25,000 contracts on the same side of the
market, provided that no more than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.
 Exercise limits will be set at the same level as position limits.
 CBOE hedge exemption provisions will apply to Index options and Index LEAPS.
 Also, for purposes of determining whether a given position in reduced-value Index options complies with applicable
position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value Index options will be aggregated with positions in the
full-value Index options. For these purposes, ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract for
purposes of aggregating these positions. 







Exchange rules applicable to the Nasdaq Index options will be identical to the rules applicable to other broad-based
index options for purposes of trading rotations, halts, and suspensions,
 and margin treatment.

H. Surveillance


The Exchange will use the same surveillance procedures currently utilized for each of the Exchange's other index
options to monitor trading in Nasdaq Index options and Index LEAPS. These procedures include complete access to trading
activity in the underlying securities. 


I. Disclaimer 


The CBOE has proposed placing in its Rules a disclaimer of liability made by Nasdaq and its affiliates that Nasdaq and
such affiliates do not make any warranties as to the results obtained from the Nasdaq index, any opening, intra-day
or closing value therefore, any related data, or any errors or delays in calculating or disseminating the Index, in
connection with the trading of option contracts based on the Index. The disclaimer is similar to other disclaimers
made on behalf of Standard & Poor's Frank Russell Company, and LIFFE Administration & Management, that are
currently in the CBOE's Rules.





III. Commission Findings and Conclusions 






The Commission has reviewed the proposal to list and trade Nasdaq Index options and Index LEAPS. As discussed below,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular, the Index is broad-based,
the proposed options are designed to reduce the potential for manipulation, and the proposal to list and trade Nasdaq
Index options and Index LEAPS is consistent with the CBOE's obligation to promote investor protection.
 The Commission finds that the trading of options on the Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS,
will permit investors to participate in the price movements of the 100 securities on which the Index is based. Further,
trading of options on the Index will allow investors holding positions in some or all of the securities underlying
the Index to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. Accordingly, the Commission, believes the Nasdaq
Index options will provide investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that should reflect accurately
the overall movement of 100 of the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq National Market. By broadening
the hedging and investment opportunities of investors, the Commission believes that the trading of Nasdaq Index
options will serve to protect investors, promote the public interest, and contribute to the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets.









The trading of options on the Nasdaq Index, including the trading of full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however,
raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market
impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE has addressed these concerns adequately.

A. Index Design and Structure


The Commission finds that the Nasdaq Index and reduced-value Nasdaq Index are broad-based indices, and thus it is
appropriate to permit Exchange rules applicable to the trading of broad-based index options to apply to the Index
options, including Index LEAPS. Specifically, the Commission believes the Index is broad-based because it reflects
a substantial segment of the U.S. equities market. In addition, the basic character of the reduced-value Nasdaq Index,
which is comprised of the same component securities as the Nasdaq Index and calculated by dividing the Nasdaq Index
by ten, is essentially identical to the Nasdaq Index.
The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component stocks significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the Index represents
and consists of the common stock values of 100 actively traded U.S. companies. Second, no one particular stock or group
of stocks dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock comprises more than 10.54% of the Index's total value and
the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounts for 33.27% of the Index's value. Third, the
overwhelming majority of the stocks that comprise the Index are actively traded, with a mean and median average daily
trading volume of 631,631 and 407,639 shares, respectively. Fourth, the market capitalizations of the stocks in
the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $26.8 billion to a low of $437 million as of October 25, 1993, with the
mean and median being $2.54 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Fifth, the Index is comprised of stocks representing
a diverse group of industries, the most heavily represented by Index weight including computer software products
and service, semiconductors, telephone equipment and service, broadcasting, and retail. Sixth, 97 out of the 100
component stocks in the Index, comprising 98.82% of the weighting of the Index, currently are eligible for options
trading.
 Finally, the Commission believes that, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those
securities will help deter as well as detect illegal trading activity involving the index option.





B. Customer Protection



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Nasdaq Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded
options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) The special risks of options
are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading
are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly,
because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options
currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection
of investors in Nasdaq Index options and Nasdaq Index LEAPS.



C. Surveillance



The Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a
stock index derivative and the exchange(s) trading the stocks underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
 In this regard, the NASD, which currently is the primary market for all of the Index's component securities, is a member
of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance
information.

D. Market Impact 


The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of Nasdaq Index options, including full-value and
reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
 First, as described above, the Index is broad-based and comprised of 100 stocks with no one stock dominating the Index.
Second, as noted above, the stocks contained in the Index have relatively large capitalizations and are relatively
actively traded. Third, the 25,000 contract position and exercise limits will serve to minimize potential manipulation
and market impact concerns. Fourth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because
the Index options will be issued and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation just like any other standardized
option traded in the United States. Fifth, existing CBOE stock index options rules and surveillance procedures will
apply to Nasdaq Index options. 





Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Nasdaq Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is reasonable and consistent with the Act. As noted
in other contexts, valuing expiring index options for exercise settlement purposes based on opening prices rather
than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on the securities underlying options on the Index.








It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-42) is approved. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change
Relating to the Disciplining of Members</DOCTITLE>



January 4, 1994.



I. Introduction




On June 25, 1993, pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change relating to the disciplining of members. Notice of the proposed rule change was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on July 26, 1993.
 No comments were received. This order approves the proposed rule change.






II. Description




Currently, GSCC's general disciplinary rule
 authorizes GSCC to discipline members for violations of GSCC's rules and other actions that constitute an abuse or
misuse of GSCC's processes and services or otherwise reflect ``conduct detrimental to GSCC's operations.'' The
proposed rule change amends the general disciplinary rule to provide language specific to GSCC's current operations
and to allow it to fulfill better its responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization.






Under GSCC's proposal, the Membership and Standards Committee (of GSCC's Board of Directors (``Board'')) (``Committee'')
 classifies rules violations or incidents of detrimental conduct as either major or minor offenses. Major offenses
generally involve either misconduct involving the funds or securities obligations of a member or deliberate acts
of fraud or misconduct by a member. Repeated offenses of a minor nature by a member, however, may cause the member to
be deemed to have committed a major offense. A member committing a major offense is subject to disciplinary action,
including termination of its membership in either or both the comparison and netting systems, having GSCC cease to
act for it, the imposition of a higher minimum Clearing Fund requirement, and/or a fine of up to $5,000.
 Disciplinary actions involving ceasing to act for or termination of membership in the comparison or netting system
require Board approval.







After the Committee has determined that a member committed a major offense, a letter automatically is sent to senior
management of the offending member requiring that the member explain to GSCC in writing why the offense occurred and
the actions taken and/or to be taken to ensure that it will not reoccur. If appropriate under the circumstances, representatives
of senior management of the member may be required to appear in person before the Committee to provide such explanation.


A member committing a minor offense is subject to a fine or other disciplinary action, not to include GSCC ceasing to
act for it or termination of membership. While a minor offense may not result in the imposition of a fine or other disciplinary
action, for each such offense, GSCC automatically will send a letter to the management of the member that commits the
offense informing it of its commission of the offense.


If the Committee (with the Board's approval in certain cases) determines that any type of disciplinary action should
be taken against a member, GSCC is obligated to notify the member of such determination. In this notification, GSCC
will state the reasons for the disciplinary action and will inform the member of its right to a hearing to contest the
action. After receiving this notice, a member has ten business days to file a written request for a hearing.


Hearings on disciplinary actions that, under GSCC's rules, require approval by the Board,
 are before a panel of five directors selected by the Board. Hearings on all other disciplinary actions are before a
panel of three Committee members selected by the Committee. Both panels must be composed of a majority of directors
who are not also GSCC officers.






A member is able to appear before the panel in person (with its counsel, if it so chooses) to contest the planned disciplinary
action. Alternatively, in lieu of a personal appearance, the member can submit to the panel documentary evidence
in support of its claim that the planned disciplinary action is inappropriate. GSCC will inform the member of the panel's
determination, as well as the member's right to appeal further to the full Board. If the panel's decision is adverse
to the member, the sanction is effective immediately.


The Board will be presented with the record of any panel hearing at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Its determination
ordinarily will be made based upon a review of that record. A member does not have the right to appear in person before
the Board to contest the determination of the panel; however, the Board may permit such a personal appearance in its
discretion. Any appeal of the Board decision will have to be made to the Commission.

III. Discussion



Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act
 requires a clearing agency to be organized so as to enable it to enforce compliance by its participants with its rules.
Section 17A(b)(3)(G) and section 17A(b)(3)(H) of the Act
 require the rules of a clearing agency to provide that is participants shall be appropriately disciplined for violations
of any provision of those rules and to provide fair procedures, consistent with section 17A(b)(5) of the Act, for disciplining
participants.
 Section 17A(b)(5) of the Act
 outlines the procedures to be followed by a clearing agency in disciplining participants. A clearing agency must
bring specific charges, notify the participant of the charges, provide the participant with an opportunity to defend
against such charges, and keep a record. GSCC's proposal is consistent with the Act, and section 17A in particular,
because it provides fair, efficient procedures for disciplining participants and enforcing its decisions as required
by that section.








GSCC has specific rules governing the circumstances pursuant to which it may take certain disciplinary actions against
a member, such as increasing a member's margin requirements, ceasing to act for a member, terminating a member's membership
in either or both the comparison and netting systems, and/or liquidating a member's positions. Pursuant to recent
changes in membership standards, GSCC also has rules governing the specific consequences of a failure of a member
to maintain an applicable membership standard.






By providing a more formal process, the proposed rule change allows GSCC to more effectively discipline its members.
Prior to imposing a sanction, members will be informed of the Committee's determination that a major or minor offense
has occurred. This procedure may prevent future violations by providing members with early notice of a violation.
In the case of a major offense, members must provide GSCC with a written explanation. This explanation may give GSCC
guidance in determining the appropriate sanction to be imposed. The members are, in turn, permitted a greater opportunity
to participate in the internal disciplinary process. By allowing the members to provide input, GSCC may be able to
resolve disputes prior to an appeal to the Commission.

The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal will enable it to discipline its members for rule violations, consistent
with sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act. The Commission also believes that GSCC's proposed procedures
are consistent with the fair disciplinary procedures requirement of section 17A(b)(3)(H), and with the mandatory
procedures enumerated in section 17A(b)(5) of the Act. The proposal permits GSCC's Board to address rule violations
fairly and efficiently. Members will be provided with notice of any disciplinary action to be taken by the Committee
or the Board, including the reasons for the action. Members will be given two opportunities to have an internal hearing
on the proposed sanction_before a panel of the Committee or Board, and before the full Board. 



IV. Conclusion



For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the
Act, and particularly with section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-93-06)
be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Pacific
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Modifications of the Stock Price Maintenance Requirement for Equity Options </DOCTITLE>
 


January 5, 1994. 
 
 


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 20, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Exchange.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

 




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
 


The PSE is proposing to amend Commentary .04 to Rule 3.7 in order to make technical corrections involving cross-referencing.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE, and at the Commission. 
 


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


In its filing with the Commission, the PSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has
prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

 


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


On November 30, 1993, the Commission approved an Exchange proposal to add new Commentaries to PSE Rule 3.7.
 The Exchange is now proposing to amend one of those, Commentary .04, by changing two internal cross-references and
adding the term ``this'' in two places. The exchange believes that the proposed changes are technical in nature and
are consistent with the Commission's order approving File No. SR-PSE-91-19.
 
 





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market. 
 


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
 


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.

 


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others 
 


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 
 


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 
 


Because the foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning,
administration, or enforcement of an exiting rule, it has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the
Act and subparagraph (e)(1) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed
rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act. 
 


IV. Solicitation of Comments 
 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-PSE-93-34
and should be submitted by February 1, 1994. 
 


 
 

For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Applicants' Representations



1. The Fund, incorporated in 1981 under the laws of the state of Maryland, is an open-end, non-diversified management
investment company registered under the Act. The Fund's investment adviser is EQSF Advisers, Inc. (``EQSF''). The
Fund does not qualify to elect to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code, and thus pays taxes on its income in the same manner as a business corporation. As of October 31, 1993, approximately
92% of the Fund's assets consisted of the common stock of Nabors.

2. Nabors, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1978, is principally engaged in the business of contract drilling
and other oilfield services. It has one class of stock, voting common stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange
(the ``AMEX''). As of October 31, 1993, approximately 18% of Nabors' stock was held by the Fund.
3. Martin J. Whitman is Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Fund. As of October 31, 1993, he owned
approximately 7.8% of the outstanding stock of the Fund. Mr. Whitman serves as a director of Nabors and has a financial
interest in Nabors other than through the Fund by virtue of his direct and indirect ownership interests in various
private partnerships that hold Nabors stock. (As of October 31, 1993, these partnerships owned in the aggregate approximately
3% of the outstanding stock of Nabors.) Mr. Whitman also controls 100% of the outstanding common stock of EQSF, the
Fund's investment adviser.
4. Applicants seek relief on behalf of themselves and any individuals (other than Mr. Whitman) who require relief
from section 17(a) and rule 17d-1 (collectively, ``Affected Persons''). ``Affected Persons'' are officers,
directors, or employees of Nabors, the Fund, and EQSF who own shares of the Fund.
5. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the ``Reorganization Agreement''), the Fund proposes to
transfer to Nabors all of its assets, other than cash and cash equivalents equal to $1 million, but none of its liabilities.
The $1 million retained by the Fund shall be placed in a ``Reserve Fund'' for payment of any contingent liabilities
and obligations of the Fund. In exchange for the Fund's assets, Nabors will transfer to the Fund shares of Nabors stock,
as described more fully in the next paragraph. The exchange of Fund assets for Nabors stock will occur on the ``Closing
Date.'' As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Fund will liquidate and dsitribute pro rata to its stockholders
of record the shares of Nabors stock received by the Fund pursuant to the Reoganization Agreement.
6. Immediately prior to the reorganization, the Fund's assets will consist entirely of Nabors stock, cash, and cash
equivalents. For purposes of the reoganization, shares of Nabors stock will be valued at the average of the closing
prices of Nabors stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the ``Market Price of Nabors
Stock'').
 Cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will be valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The number of shares of Nabors stock to be issued to the Fund in the reorganization will be determined by dividing the
aggregate value of the assets transferred from the Fund to Nabors by the Market Price of Nabors Stock.




7. The Reserve Fund is designed to satisfy any currently unknown contingent liabilities that may become actual after
liquidation of the Fund. Potential contingent liabilities include the possibility that the IRS or a state tax authority
would assert that the Fund has made inadequate provision for taxes on past transactions, or that the Fund's net asset
value had been erroneously computed. Although the Fund currently is unaware of any such liabilities, the Reserve
Fund will be established to protect Fund officers and directors, who otherwise would be personally liable for such
liabilities. The Reserve Fund shall be administered by one or more of the Fund's disinterested directors. Any amounts
remaining in the Reserve Fund upon its termination (which, under applicable Maryland law shall occur no earlier than
three years from its inception) shall be distributed 

pro rata 

to the Fund's stockholders of record as of the Closing Date.
8. The Fund will bear all of the expenses associated with the reorganization, except that Nabors will bear all legal
fees incurred by it related to the negotiation of the Reorganization Agreement. Applicants expect the total cost
of the Reorganization to range from $400,000 to $450,000, of which the Fund will pay all but approximately $100,000.
9. The Reorganization Agreement has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund, including the disinterested
directors thereof, and by the Board of Directors of Nabors, including the nonmanagement directors thereof. (The
two boards have one common member, Mr. Whitman.) Consumation of the reorganization is subject to the Commission's
issuance of the order requested by applicants and to the approval of Fund stockholders. The Reorganization Agreement
will be submitted to the stockholders of the Fund for approval at a special meeting. Fund stockholders will receive
a proxy statement/prospectus containing information about Nabors and describing the proposed reorganization
and the reasons therefor.
10. In approving the Reorganization Agreement, the Fund Board considered a number of factors. First, and most important,
the reorganization is tax-free. The Fund received an IRS ruling on May 20, 1993, to the effect that, for federal income
tax purposes, the reorganization will be tax-free to the Fund, the Fund's stockholders, and Nabors. Alternatives
to the reorganization, including a simple liquidation of the Fund, would result in a taxable event to both the Fund
and its stockholders. In this regard, applicants note that alternatives to the reorganization would require the
Fund to pay tax, estimated to be about $30.3 million (approximately 35% of the Fund's net asset value), on the capital
gains attributable to the appreciation of Nabors stock held by the Fund. In addition, the Fund Board considered that
(i) the reorganization will eliminate the management fee currently paid by Fund stockholders, because such individuals
will own Nabors stock directly, rather than indirectly through the Fund; (ii) Fund shareholders will receive readily
marketable securities, since Nabors stock is traded on the AMEX; and (iii) the costs to the Fund of engaging in the reorganization
will not be significant in relation to the benefits conferred.

11. Fund stockholders who oppose the reorganization may redeem their shares at any time before the Closing Date. Redeeming
stockholders, however, would forego the tax benefit of the reorganization because the elimination of the capital
gains tax associated with the Nabors stock will inure only to the benefit of Fund stockholders who receive liquidating
distributions.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Because the Fund owns of record more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Nabors, Nabors is an ``affiliated person''
of the Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Because Mr. Whitman controls the Fund's investment adviser,
is a director of the Fund and Nabors, and holds a substantial indirect interest in Nabors, Mr. Whitman is an affiliated
person of the Fund and Nabors. The Affected Persons, by virtue of their official positions and/or employment relationships,
are affiliated persons of the Fund or affiliated persons of such persons.
2. Section 17(a)d of the Act, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such an affiliated person, acting as principal, to purchase from or sell to such
registered company any security or other property. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a
proposed transaction from section 17(a) if: (i) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration
to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and
(iii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
3. For the reasons discussed above, the Fund Board and the Nabors Board found that the reorganization is in the best
interests of the Fund and Nabors, respectively, and will not dilute the interests of the existing stockholders of
either company. In addition, each Board determined that the terms of the proposed reorganization and the consideration
to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching by any person. Although the Fund has agreed
to pay most of the costs associated with the reorganization, applicants aver that the benefits to the Fund, in particular
the elimination of a $30 million deferred tax liability, substantially outweigh any such costs. Accordingly, applicants
submit that the proposed reorganization satisfies the standards of section 17(b).
4. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, taken together, prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company
or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in any joint enterprise or other joint
arrangement in which such registered company is a participant, without prior receipt of a Commission order. Under
rule 17d-1(b), the Commission will consider whether the participation of such registered company in such joint
enterprise or arrangement on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the
Act, and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
5. There are no employment contracts or other special benefits accorded to any affiliated person of the Fund or Nabors
under the Reorganization Agreement. Indeed, the reorganization could be considered detrimental to Mr. Whitman
and those Affected Persons who are employees of EQSF because it will eliminate the management fee currently payable
to EQSF by the Fund. Accordingly, applicants submit that the proposed reorganization satisfies the standards for
an order under rule 17d-1.

Notice of establishment of Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of the establishment of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group of
the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC on
air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One are the ARAC deals with is air carrier/general aviation
maintenance issues. These issues involve mechanic certification and approved training schools outlined in parts
65 and 147 and the maintenance standards for parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 aircraft, engines, propellers, and
their component parts and parallel provisions in parts 21, 43, 91, 121, 125, 127, 129, 133, 135, and 137 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR), which are the responsibility of the FAA Director, Flight Standards Service.



Task



Specifically, ARAC tasked the working group as follows: Review Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14_Aeronautics
and Space, Chapter I_Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, and supporting policy and
guidance material for the purpose of determining the course of action to be taken for rulemaking and/or policy relative
to the issue of acceptable and/or approved data. If ARAC determines rulemaking documents or advisory circulars are
appropriate to resolve the major/minor problem, such documents should be developed by ARAC, along with proper justifications
and any legal and economic analyses.



Reports



The working group will develop and present to ARAC for consideration any combination of the following as it deems appropriate:

1. A draft notice of proposed rulemaking proposing new requirements with regard to the issue of acceptable and/or
approved date with supporting economic and other required analysis, and any other collateral documents the working
group determines appropriate; or

2. If new or revised requirements standards or compliance methods are not recommended, a draft report stating the
rationale for those recommendations. 

The working group chair (or his designee) should:

A. Recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including rationale, for consideration at the meeting of the
ARAC to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues held following publication of this notice.

B. Give a status report on this task at each meeting of ARAC held to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues; and

C. Give a detailed conceptual presentation to ARAC of the working group's recommendations before proceeding with
drafting of documents described in paragraphs A and B above.

The Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs of Alterations Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations
having an interest in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the
member organizations of the ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member
of the working group should write the person listed under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues and the Chair of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group, and the individual
will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated.

The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider air carrier/general
aviation maintenance issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act. Meetings of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group will not be open
to the public, except to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received from the Kentucky Railway Museum, Incorporated a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements
of Federal regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature
of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 



Kentucky Railway Museum, Incorporated (KRM) Waiver Petition, Docket Number SA-93-7 



The KRM seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards.
The KRM is requesting that it be permitted to operate diesel locomotive number 32 which does not comply with 49 CFR 231.29
``road locomotives with corner stairways'' in that the uncoupling mechanism cannot be operated from the bottom stairway
opening and Section 231.30 ``locomotives used in switching service'' which requires switching steps and the removal
of end foot boards. 

Locomotive number 32 is an EMD, Model BL-2 locomotive built in 1948. The locomotive is equipped with end footboards
and arranged with a step and handhold located on the side at each corner, front and rear, for access to the walkway and
cab structure. The uncoupling mechanism is operated from ground level. 

The KRM is a railroad museum which operates historical equipment for the education and enjoyment of the visiting public.
The train is operated between New Haven and Boston, Kentucky, a distance of 25 miles round trip at a maximum speed of
25 mph. 

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-93-7) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC. 20590. Communications received before February 22,
1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as
far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9 a.m._5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Exemption or Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received requests for exemptions from or waivers of compliance with a requirement of its safety standards. The
individual petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved,
and the nature of the relief being requested. 

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number RSGM-93-16) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before February 22,
1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as
far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9 a.m._5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

New Car Assessment Program; Technical Report; Correlation of NCAP Performance With Fatality Risk in Actual Head-On
Collisions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the publication by NHTSA of a Technical Report concerning the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP).
The report examines the Correlation of NCAP Performance with Fatality Risk in Actual Head-On Collisions. In NCAP,
frontal crash tests of approximately 35 passenger vehicles are conducted each year and the test results are made available
to the public, in response to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972. The Department of Transportation
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 directed ``NHTSA to provide a study to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations comparing the results of New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) data from previous model
years to determine the validity of these tests in predicting actual on-the-road injuries and fatalities over the
lifetime of the models.'' In December 1993, NHTSA submitted a report to Congress, titled Response to the NCAP FY 1992
Congressional Requirements, summarizing the agency's analyses of head-on collisions and other types of crashes.
This Technical Report documents the agency's analysis of head-on collisions. The agency seeks public review and
comment on the technical report. Comments received will be used to improve future analyses of the correlation of NCAP
performance and fatality or injury risk.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) has gauged the performance of vehicles in frontal impact tests since model year
1979. In response to Congressional direction, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration studied the relationship
between vehicle test scores in NCAP and the fatality risk in crashes of vehicles on the road. This study is based on head-on
collisions, where the effect of crashworthiness can be separated from the effects of extraneous factors that influence
fatality rates (drivers, roadways, mileage). Collisions between two 1979-91 passenger cars in which both
drivers were wearing safety belts were selected from the Fatal Accident Reporting System. There were 396 collisions
(792 cars) in which both cars were identical with or very similar to vehicles which had been tested in NCAP. In the analyses,
adjustments were made for the relative weights of the cars, and for the age and sex of the drivers_factors which substantially
affect fatality risk.





There are statistically significant correlations between NCAP scores for head injury, chest acceleration and femur
loading and the actual fatality risk of belted drivers. A composite NCAP score, based on the test results for all three
body regions, has excellent correlation with fatality risk: In a head-on collision between a car with good composite
score and a car of equal weight with poor score, the driver of the car with the better NCAP score has, on average, a 20 to
25 percent lower risk of fatal injury. Slightly smaller, but still significant fatality reductions are obtained
even when the NCAP scores for just one body region (just HIC, or chest g's, or femur load) are used to partition the fleet
into ``good'' and ``poor'' performance groups. The borderline between good and poor NCAP scores that optimizes the
differences in actual fatality risk is close to the criteria specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS)
208 for each of the three body regions.


Cars built from 1979 through 1982 had, on the average, the poorest NCAP scores. Test performance improved substantially
in 1983 through 1986 models, and continued to improve in 1987 through 1991 cars. In parallel, fatality risk for belted
drivers in actual head-on collisions decreased by 20 to 25 percent in model years 1979-91, with the largest decreases
just after 1982. The 35 mph test speed for NCAP is 5 mph higher than the test speed for FMVSS 208. By now, most passenger
cars meet the FMVSS 208 criteria at the NCAP test speed. The study shows that achievement of this enhanced level of test
performance has been accompanied by a significant reduction in actual fatality risk. However, being a statistical
study, it does not address what portion of the fatality reduction was directly ``caused'' by NCAP. Also, these results
do not guarantee that any individual make-model with low NCAP scores will necessarily have lower fatality risk than
another make-model with higher NCAP scores.

NHTSA welcomes public review of the technical report and invites the reviewers to submit comments about the data and
the statistical methods used in the report. The agency is interested in learning of any additional data that could
be used to expand or improve the analyses, such as information about the curb weights of cars and light trucks.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose, in the envelope
with their comments, a self_addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will
return the postcard by mail.
