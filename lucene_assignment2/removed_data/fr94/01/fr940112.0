Contracts With Transportation Lines; Signatory Authority


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

 Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

 This final rule amends agency regulations by adding the names of airlines who have entered into agreements with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) under the purview of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the
Act). This rule is necessary so that air carriers who become signatory to preinspection or transit without visa (TWOV)
agreements with the Services are listed in agency regulations. This rule also adds Aruba and Paradise Island, Bahamas
to the list of preinspection stations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 Under the current regulations, air carriers are required to enter into contracts with the Service in order to participate
in the preinspection and Transit Without Visa (TWOV) programs. Contracts have been signed using Forms I-425
(Agreement for Preinspection) and I-426 (Immediate and Continuous Transit Agreement) under the purview of
section 238 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Accordingly,   238.3 and 238.4 of title 8 of the Code
of Federal Regulations are being amended to include these carriers.


The Service's implementation of this rule as a final rule is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C.
553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reasons for immediate implementation of this final rule are as follows: A notice and comment
period for a proposed rule is unnecessary because this regulation merely updates the listing of carriers and preinspection
stations signatory with the agency. Moreover, it imposes a benefit rather than a burden or penalty of any kind to applicable
persons.
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated
that this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact since this rule merely amends agency regulations
by adding to the list of airline carriers and preinspection stations. This rule is not significant within the meaning
of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.


List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 238


Administrative practice and procedures, Air carriers, Aliens, Government contracts, Travel.



Accordingly, part 238 of chapter I of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:

Alteration of Jet Route J-171; CO 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action revokes a portion of Jet Route J-171 from Hugo, CO, to Kiowa, CO, because the Kiowa, CO, Very High Frequency
Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Navigation (VORTAC) facility will be decommissioned after the new Denver International
Airport becomes operational. This action supports the new Denver International Airport airspace realignment.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
History 



On August 6, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to remove that
portion of Jet Route J-171 from Hugo, CO, to Kiowa, CO (58 FR 42038). 

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment
is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The jet route listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. 



The Rule 



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes a portion of Jet Route J-171 from Hugo,
CO, to Kiowa, CO. The Kiowa, CO, VORTAC will be decommissioned after the new Denver International Airport becomes
operational. This accommodates the new Denver International Airport airspace realignment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore; (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Designation of Class E Airspace, Dunnellon, FL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action establishes Class E airspace at Dunnellon, Florida. A Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP)
for Runway 23 at the Dunnellon Airport has been developed and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above
the surface of the earth is needed to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when using this SIAP.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On June 23, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Dunnellon, Florida, to accommodate a Runway 23 instrument approach procedure to the Dunnellon
Airport, Dunnellon, Florida (58 FR 41211). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700
feet above the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation,
while transiting between the en route and terminal environments, and to change the operating status of the airport
from visual flight rules (VFR) operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Airspace Reclassificaiton, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area'' and has replaced it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' for airspace extending upward from 700 feet above
the surface. The coorindates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designation for Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1
(58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Dunnellon, Florida,
to accommodate a Runway 23 SIAP based on the Ocala Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation
facility (VORTAC) to the Dunnellon Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface
is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach.
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable VFR requirements.
In addition, the operating status of the Dunnellon Airport is changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations
concurrent with the publication of the SIAP.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Modification of Class D Airspace; Seattle, WA




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends the Class D airspace for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Boeing Field Airport, and Renton
Municipal Airport. These changes are necessary to reflect the actual airspace delegated to each airport traffic
control tower and show this airspace on appropriate aeronautical charts for pilots' use.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


History




On August 17, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the
Class D airspace for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Boeing Field Airport, and Renton Municipal Airport,
Washington (58 FR 43573).

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice, except some coordinates of the airspace descriptions have been changed slightly to delete a small amount
of Class D airspace south of Boeing Field which was found to be unnecessary. The coordinates in the proposal were North
American Datum 27; however, these coordinates have been updated to North American Datum 83. Class D airspace areas
are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order.


The Rule




This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class D airspace for Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport, Boeing Field Airport, and Renton Municipal Airport, Washington. These changes are necessary to reflect
the actual airspace delegated to each airport traffic control tower and to show this airspace on appropriate aeronautical
charts for pilots' use.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action revokes Jet Route J-201 located between the Myton, UT, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical
Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility and the Scottsbluff, NE, VORTAC. This jet route failed to meet the necessary criteria
required for extended service volume protection during the latest flight check. The FAA has issued several notices
to airmen (NOTAM) stating that J-201 is canceled and flight is not authorized. These NOTAM's will be canceled
once this final rule becomes effective on March 3, 1994.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures: Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAP's, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the compete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the US Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and
safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable,
and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective
in less than 30 days.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPs criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affective airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant

Rule Concerning Disclosures of Energy Consumption and Water Use Information About Certain Home Appliances and Other
Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Energy and Water Use Rule, each required label on a covered appliance must show a range, or scale, indicating
the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model. This
notice publishes the new range figures, which, under   305.10, 305.11 and 305.14 of the rule, must be used
on labels on refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers manufactured on and after April 12, 1994, and in
advertising of refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers in catalogs printed after April 12, 1994. Properly
labeled refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers manufactured prior to the effective date need not
be relabeled. Catalogs printed prior to the effective date in accordance with 16 CFR 305.14 need not be revised.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule,
 pursuant to section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975,
 covering certain appliance categories, including refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. The rule
requires that energy costs and related information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all refrigerators,
refrigerator-freezers and freezers presently manufactured. Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must
disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer or freezer is advertised
in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then the range of estimated annual
energy costs for the product must be included on each page of the catalog that lists the product. The required disclosures
and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements must be based on the results
of test procedures developed by the Department of Energy, which are referenced in the rule. 







Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers, after filing an initial report, to report estimated annual
operating cost or energy efficiency annually by specified dates for each product type.
 Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models
to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated
is constantly changing. 





To keep the required information in line with these changes, the Commission is empowered, under  305.10 of the
rule, to publish new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper
or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15%. 

The new figures for the estimated annual costs of operation for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers,
which were calculated using the 1993 representative average energy cost for electricity (8.30 cents per kilowatt-hour)
published by DOE on January 5, 1993,
 have been submitted and have been analyzed by the Commission. New ranges based upon them are herewith published.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Energy and Water Use Rule, each required label on a covered appliance must show a range, or scale, indicating
the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model. This
notice publishes the new range figures, which, under   305.10, 305.11 and 305.14 of the rule must be used
on labels on dishwashers manufactured on and after April 12, 1994, and in advertising of dishwashers beginning April
12, 1994. Properly labeled dishwashers manufactured prior to the effective date need not be relabeled. Catalogs
printed prior to the effective date in accordance with 16 CFR 305.14 need not be revised.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA)
 requires the Federal Trade Commission to consider labeling rules for the disclosure of estimated annual energy cost
or alternative energy consumption information for at least thirteen categories of appliances. Dishwashers are
included as one of the categories. Before these labeling requirements may be prescribed, the statute requires the
Department of Energy (``DOE'') to develop test procedures that measure how much energy the appliances use. In addition,
DOE is required to determine the representative average cost a customer pays for the different types of energy available.








On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule
 covering seven of the thirteen appliance categories, including dishwashers. The rule requires that energy costs
and related information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all dishwashers presently manufactured.
Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a dishwasher
is advertised in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then on each page of
the catalog that lists the product shall be included the range of estimated annual energy costs for the product. The
required disclosures and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements
must be based on the results of the DOE test procedures.





Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers, after filing an initial report, to report annually by specified
dates for each product type.
 The data submitted by manufacturers are based, in part, on the representative average unit cost of the type of energy
used to run the appliances tested. According to  305.9 of the rule, these average energy costs, which are provided
by DOE, will be periodically revised by the Commission, but not more often than annually. Because the costs for the
various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models to their lines, improve
existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated is constantly
changing. To keep the required information in line with these changes, the Commission is empowered, under  305.10
of the rule, to publish new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the
upper or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15%.





The new figures for the estimated annual costs of operation for dishwashers, which were calculated using the 1993
representative average energy costs published by DOE on January 5, 1993,
 have been submitted and have been analyzed by the Commission. New ranges based upon them are herewith published. 





In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends appendix C of its Energy and Water Use Rule by publishing
the following ranges of comparability for use in the labeling and advertising of dishwashers beginning April 12,
1994.



List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 305

Revision of the Regulations Governing 
Commission Review of Department of Energy Remedial Orders 



Issued January 4, 1994.

 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising its regulations governing Commission review
of contested Department of Energy remedial orders. The Commission is removing as not necessary the requirement that
the presiding officer submit a revised proposed order to the Commission at the same time as he or she certifies and files
with the Secretary the record in the proceeding and copies of written comments by the parties. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In addition to publishing the full text of this document in the 

Federal Register

, the Commission also provides all interested persons an opportunity to inspect or copy the contents of this document

I. Introduction 



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising its regulations in part 385 governing Commission
review of contested Department of Energy (DOE) remedial orders. The Commission is removing the requirement that
the presiding officer submit a revised proposed order to the Commission at the same time as he or she certifies and files
with the Secretary the record in the proceeding and copies of written comments by the parties. 



II. Background and Discussion 



The Commission reviews contested DOE remedial orders pursuant to section 503(c) of the Department of Energy Organization
Act (DOE Act).

1

 Under the current Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Commission Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who presides over
a remedial order proceeding issues a public decision and proposed order following the hearing in the matter. The parties
then have an opportunity to file comments and reply comments. The ALJ receives the comments and certifies the record
to the Commission. In addition, the Judge also submits to the Commission a nonpublic ``revised proposed order.''
The revised proposed order is not part of the record of the proceeding.

The Commission is eliminating the requirement in 
 385.913(d) of the Commission's regulations that ALJs submit a revised proposed order. This action will expedite
the appeal process by removing an unnecessary, duplicative step in remedial order proceedings. Since the Commission
now finds that revised proposed orders are not necessary, draft orders that have already been submitted by ALJs to
the Commission in pending and recently completed remedial order cases will be placed in the public docket of each proceeding.
Parties do not have any additional procedural rights or opportunities by virtue of the inclusion of these draft orders
in the public docket. Under the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure in remedial order cases, the parties
already enjoy ample opportunities to present their positions fully before the Commission.

III. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)

3

 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

4

 Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 






IV. Environmental Statement 



Issuance of this rule will not represent a major federal action having a significant adverse effect on the human environment
under the Commission's regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act.

5

 This rule is procedural and falls within the categorical exemptions provided in the Commission's regulations. Neither
an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment is required.

6

 






V. Information Collection Statement 



Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require that OMB approve certain information collection requirements
imposed by agency rule.

7

 This rule contains no information collection requirements and is not subject to OMB approval. 





VI. Administrative Findings and Effective Date 



This final rule is a rule of agency organization and procedure that does not alter any substantive rights or interests,
but merely deletes a nonpublic, revised proposed order in remedial order proceedings that is unnecessary and duplicative
in Commission deliberations. Prior notice and comment under section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act are therefore

unnecessary.

8

 The Commission finds good cause to make this rule effective immediately upon issuance. This rule, therefore, is effective
January 4, 1994.

Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These final regulations amend the existing 
regulations to reflect the provisions of section 10305 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 1989).



Section 10305 requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), in making certain determinations
of good cause, without fault, and good faith under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), take into account any
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language)
the individual has. 
In addition, section 10305 amended title XVI of the Act to require that the Secretary take these limitations into account
in determining with respect to an individual's eligibility for title XVI benefits, whether the individual acted
in good faith or was without fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or intent. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 30, 1991, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 55848. We received comments from a
nonprofit public interest law center and a national nonprofit organization. Both organizations represent people
who are hearing impaired and both strongly supported the proposed rule and urged its adoption. The final rule, with
the exception of several technical changes we have made and which we discuss below, is the same as the NPRM. 


Sections 10305 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of OBRA 1989 amended sections 203(l), 204(b), 223(f), and 223(g)(2)(B) of title
II of the Act, respectively, to require that the Secretary, in making certain determinations and decisions of good
cause, fault, and good faith under the respective sections of the Act, take into account any physical, mental, educational,
or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has. In addition,
section 10305(e) of OBRA 1989 amended section 1631(c)(1) of title XVI of the Act to require that the Secretary take
these limitations into account in determining with respect to the eligibility of an individual for benefits under
title XVI, whether the individual acted in good faith or was without fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or
intent. The Conference Committee Report on OBRA 1989 indicates that the Congress intended that the amendment to section
1631(c)(1) of the Act would apply to provisions of title XVI that are similar to the title II provisions amended by sections
10305 (a) through (d). (H.R. Rep. No. 386, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 708 (1989).) The amendments made by section 10305
are effective for determinations or decisions made after June 30, 1990. 
Generally, it has been our policy to take into account the limitations described in section 10305 in making determinations
or decisions of good cause, without fault, or good faith (or determinations or decisions concerning fraudulent or
similar intent) with respect to the rights and duties of applicants and beneficiaries under the title II and title
XVI programs. However, our existing regulations were not explicit in this respect. Therefore, we are revising our
regulations under the title II and title XVI programs to reflect explicitly the amendments to the Act made by section
10305 of OBRA 1989. The changes to the regulations make it clear that we will take into account any physical, mental,
educational, or linguistic limitations of an individual (including any lack of facility with the English language)
in making a determination of good cause, without fault, or good faith, as appropriate, under section 203(l), 204(b),
223(f), or 223(g)(2)(B) of the Act (as required by the amendments made by sections 10305 (a) through (d)), and in determining
with respect to an individual's eligibility for benefits under title XVI of the Act, whether such individual acted
in good faith or was without fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or intent (as required under the amendment
made to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act by section 10305(e)). Also, in keeping with the intent of Congress and in the interest
of consistency, we are amending certain provisions of the title II regulations to provide expressly for the consideration
of the limitations described in section 10305 in making certain determinations and decisions under the title II program
which relate to good cause or fraudulent intent and which are not covered expressly by the amendments under sections
10305 (a) through (d) of OBRA 1989. The changes we are making are discussed below.

 Good Cause for Failure to Make Timely Reports 



Generally, in certain cases described in section 203 of the Act, a title II beneficiary who (1) Works for more than 45
hours during a month in noncovered employment outside the United States, (2) ceases to have a child in his or her care,
or (3) has earnings in excess of the annual exempt amount under the earnings test, is subject to a penalty (in the form
of benefit deductions) if he or she fails to report these facts to us within a specified time. However, under section
203(l) of the Act, a penalty does not apply if the individual can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that
he or she has good cause for failing to make a timely report. 

Section 10305(a) of OBRA 1989 amended section 203(l) to provide that the Secretary, in making determinations and
decisions of good cause, must take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including
any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has. 

Section 404.454 is the regulation which implements section 203(l). Accordingly, we are amending  404.454(a)
to provide that in making determinations and decisions of good cause for failure to make timely reports, we will take
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with
the English language) the individual has. In addition, we are adding a new paragraph, (a)(9), to  404.454 to
illustrate that good cause may be found where failure to file a timely report was due, for example, to a failure on the
part of the individual to understand reporting responsibilities due to his or her physical, mental, educational,
or linguistic limitation(s). 

Under section 1631(e)(2) of the Act, an individual who is required under rules prescribed by the Secretary to make
a timely report of circumstances affecting eligibility for, or the amount of, title XVI benefits is subject to a penalty
(in the form of benefit deductions) if the individual fails to make the required report on time. However, the penalty
under section 1631(e)(2) does not apply if the individual is without fault or has good cause for not reporting timely.


Section 416.732 of our current regulations explains how we determine whether an individual has good cause for failure
to make a timely report for purposes of section 1631(e)(2). We are adding a new paragraph to  416.732 to provide
that we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack
of facility with the English language) the individual has in making determinations and decisions of good cause for
failure to make timely reports.

 Fraudulent Behavior or Failure To Cooperate or To Take 
Any Required Action in Disability Determinations 



Under sections 223(f) and 1614(a)(4) of the Act, title II or 
title XVI disability benefits may be terminated if a prior 
favorable determination of disability was fraudulently obtained 
or if the beneficiary fails, without good cause, to cooperate 
with the Secretary in reviewing his or her entitlement or to 
follow prescribed treatment which is expected to restore his or 
her ability to work. 

Section 10305(c) of OBRA 1989 amended section 223(f) of the 
Act to provide that in making, for purposes of section 223(f), 
any determination or decision relating to fraudulent behavior by 
any individual or failure by any individual without good cause to 
cooperate or to take any required action, the Secretary shall 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual may have. In addition, with 
respect to making similar determinations and decisions for 
purposes of section 1614(a)(4) of the Act, section 1631(c)(1) of 
title XVI of the Act, as amended by OBRA 1989, requires the 
Secretary to take these limitations into account in determining 
whether an individual acted in good faith or was at fault, and in 
determining fraud, deception, or intent. 

Sections 404.1518, 404.1530, 404.1579, 404.1594, 416.918, 
416.930, 416.994 and 416.994a reflect the pertinent provisions of 
sections 223(f) and 1614(a)(4) of the Act. We are making the 
following changes in these regulations: 

 Amend   404.1518 and 416.918 to provide that we will take 
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) the individual has when determining if the individual 
has a good reason for failing to attend a consultative 
examination which we have arranged for the individual. These 
specific amendments were not included in the NPRM. Current 
  404.1518 and 416.918 provide that we may determine that an 
individual who is applying for benefits based on disability or 
blindness is not disabled or blind, or that an individual who is 
entitled to or eligible for benefits based on disability or 
blindness is no longer disabled or blind, if we find that the 
individual failed or refused to attend a consultative examination 
without a good reason. While   404.1518 and 416.918 provide 
rules for determining whether an individual has a good reason for 
such failure or refusal and, thus, are within the scope of the 
amendments to sections 223(f) and 1631(c)(1) of the Act, we 
inadvertently failed to include these regulations when we 
developed the proposed regulations to implement section 10305 of 
OBRA 1989. We are amending   404.1518(a) and 416.918(a) in the 
final rule to make it clear that we will consider an individual's 
physical, mental, educational, and linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) in 
determining whether the individual has a good reason for failing 
to attend a consultative examination. In connection with this 
change, we also are making related changes, which were not in the 
NPRM, to   404.1579(e)(2), 404.1586(d), 404.1594(e)(2), 
416.986(c), 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a(g)(2) to include in 
these sections a cross-reference to  404.1518 or  416.918, as 
appropriate, to clarify that   404.1518 and 416.918 provide the 
rules for determining whether an individual has a good reason for 
not attending a consultative examination. Current 
 416.994a(g)(2) already contains such a cross-reference. 
 Amend   404.1530(c) and 416.930(c) to provide that we will 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual has when deciding if the 
individual has acceptable reasons for failure to follow 
prescribed treatment. 

 Amend   404.1579 (e)(1) and (e)(2), 404.1594 (e)(1) and 
(e)(2), 416.994 (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a (g)(1) and 
(g)(2) to indicate that we will take into account any physical, 
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any 
lack of facility with the English language) the individual has in 
determining whether a prior favorable determination or decision 
was fraudulently obtained or in determining whether an individual 
has good cause for failure to supply evidence we ask for or to go 
for a physical or mental examination. The amendments to these 
sections of the regulations include certain technical changes 
that were not reflected in the NPRM. For the final rule, we are 
adding the phrase ``or decision'' to   404.1579(e)(1), 
404.1594(e)(1), 416.994(b)(4)(i) and 416.994a(g)(1) to clarify 
that these provisions apply not only to determinations we make, 
but also to decisions we make. Section 416.994a(g)(1) already 
contains this language. Also, as discussed above, 
  404.1579(e)(2), 404.1586(d), 404.1594(e)(2), 416.986(c), 
416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a(g)(2) of the final rule include a 
cross-reference to  404.1518 or  416.918, as appropriate, which 
provides rules for determining whether an individual has good 
cause for failing to attend a consultative examination.

Consistent with the NPRM, the final changes to 
  404.1579(e)(2), 404.1594(e)(2), 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 
416.994a(g)(2) also explain that we will consider the factors 
described in   404.911 and 416.1411 for purposes of determining 
generally whether an individual has good cause for failure to 
cooperate in a review of his or her entitlement to benefits based 
on disability. (Current   404.911 and 416.1411 explain the 
factors we consider in determining whether an individual has good 
cause for missing a deadline to request review of a determination 
or decision under our administrative review process. As 
explained later in this preamble, we are amending   404.911 and 
416.1411, which apply to title II and title XVI cases, 
respectively, to provide explicitly for the consideration of the 
limitations described in section 10305 of OBRA 1989 in 
determining whether an individual has good cause for missing a 
deadline to request review.) We are also revising 
  404.1586(d) and 416.986(c) to clarify that we will 
consider the factors described in   404.911 and 416.1411, 
respectively, for purposes of determining generally whether an 
individual has good cause for failure to cooperate in a review of 
his or her continuing entitlement to title II benefits, or 
continuing eligibility for title XVI benefits, based on 
blindness. 



 Without Fault_Waiver of Adjustment or Recovery of 
Overpayments 



Under sections 204(b) and 1631(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 
recovery or adjustment of overpayments to a title II or title XVI 
beneficiary may be waived in situations where the individual is 
without fault in connection with the overpayment and recovery or 
adjustment would defeat the purposes of the program or would be 
against equity and good conscience or, with respect to the 
title XVI program, would impede efficient or effective 
administration of title XVI because of the small amount involved. 
Our existing regulations explain that in determining whether an 
individual was without fault, all pertinent factors surrounding 
the overpayment will be considered, including the individual's 
age, intelligence, education, and physical and mental 
capabilities. 

Section 10305(b) of OBRA 1989 amended section 204(b) of the 
Act to provide that the Secretary, in making determinations or 
decisions of ``without fault'' for purposes of section 204(b), must 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual has. In addition, the amendment 
to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act made by section 10305(e) of OBRA 
1989 provides that, for the purposes of the title XVI program, 
the Secretary must take these same limitations into account in 
determining, among other things, whether an individual is without 
fault. 

We are making the following changes in our regulations which 
implement sections 204(b) and 1631(b)(1)(B) of the Act to reflect 
the pertinent amendments made by section 10305. 

 Amend  404.507 to provide that in making 
determinations of without fault with respect to title II 
overpayments, we will take into account any physical, mental, 
educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of 
facility with the English language) the individual has.

 Amend  404.510 to provide that in determining whether an 
individual is without fault with respect to a title II deduction 
overpayment, we will consider all pertinent circumstances, 
including an individual's age and intelligence and any physical, 
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations of the individual 
(including any lack of facility with the English language). In 
addition, to eliminate any ambiguity with respect to the 
application of the amendment to section 204(b) of the Act made by 
section 10305(b) of OBRA 1989 in cases involving title II 
deduction overpayments, the changes to  404.510 will: 
(1) clarify that the situations described in  404.510 in which 
an individual will be considered without fault in connection with 
a deduction overpayment are not all-inclusive; and (2) eliminate 
the provision in paragraph (n) of  404.510 which requires that 
for an individual to be considered without fault with respect to 
a deduction overpayment in certain circumstances described in 
paragraph (n), such individual must have made a bona fide attempt 
to restrict his or her annual earnings or otherwise comply with 
the deduction provisions of the Act. 
 Amend  404.511(b) to show that the Social Security 
Administration generally will not find an individual to be 
without fault when, after having been exonerated for a title II 
``deduction overpayment'' and after having been advised of the 
correct interpretation of the deduction provision, the individual 
incurs another ``deduction overpayment'' under the same 
circumstances as the first overpayment. The change to 
 404.511(b) also explains that in determining ``without fault'' 
under such circumstances, however, any physical, mental, 
educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of 
facility with the English language) the individual has will be 
taken into consideration. 
 Amend  416.552 to provide that we will take into account 
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual has in determining whether the individual is without 
fault for purposes of the waiver of adjustment or recovery of a 
title XVI overpayment. 
In general, under section 1631(b)(4) of the Act and the 
implementing regulation,  416.556, if any title XVI overpayment 
is attributable solely to the ownership or possession by an 
individual (or by an individual and his or her spouse, if any) of 
countable resources having a value which exceeds, by $50 or less, 
the applicable limitation on resources specified in the Act and 
regulations, such individual (and spouse if any) will be deemed 
to have been without fault in connection with the overpayment, 
and waiver of adjustment or recovery will be made, unless the 
failure to report the value of the excess resources correctly and 
in a timely manner was willful and knowing. Based on the 
amendment to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act made by 
section 10305(e) of OBRA of 1989, we are amending  416.556(b) to 
provide that in determining whether failure to report the excess 
resources correctly and in a timely manner was willful and 
knowing, and, thus, whether the individual was at fault, we will 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual has. 



 Good Faith_Waiver of Recovery of Overpayments_Continuation 
of Disability Benefits Pending Appeal 


Under sections 223(g) and 1631(a)(7) of the Act and the 
implementing regulations at   404.1597a and 416.996, a title II 
or title XVI beneficiary receiving benefits based on disability 
whom the Secretary determines is no longer disabled based on 
medical factors has the option of having his or her benefits 
continued through a hearing before an administrative law judge 
(ALJ). Benefits paid during this period are considered 
overpayments if the beneficiary loses the appeal. However, if 
the beneficiary acted in good faith in pursuing the appeal, 
repayment can be waived (sections 223(g)(2)(B) and 
1631(a)(7)(B)(ii) of the Act and 404.1597a(j) and 416.996(g) of 
our regulations). Our regulations establish a presumption that 
appeals are made in good faith unless the beneficiary fails, 
without good cause, to cooperate during the appeal.

Section 10305(d) of OBRA 1989 amended section 223(g)(2)(B) 
of the Act to require that the Secretary take into account any 
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations an 
individual may have (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) in determining whether an individual's appeal 
is made in good faith. 
Based on this amendment and the amendment to title XVI of 
the Act made by section 10305(e) of OBRA 1989, we are amending 
  404.1597a(j)(3) and 416.996(g)(2) to provide that we will take 
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) the individual has in determining whether the 
individual acted in good faith in pursuing the appeal. 


 Determinations of Good Cause or of Fraud or Similar 
Fault in Connection With the Administrative Review Process 


Section 10305(e) amended section 1631(c)(1) of the Act to 
provide that the Secretary shall specifically take into account 
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations of 
an individual (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) in determining, with respect to the eligibility of the 
individual for benefits under title XVI, whether the individual 
acted in good faith or was at fault, and in determining fraud, 
deception, or intent. 
The changes we are making in part 416 of the regulations in 
connection with the administrative review process are based on 
the amendment to section 1631(c)(1). We are making comparable 
changes in part 404 in the interest of consistency. 
Our current regulations provide that a determination or 
decision which we make about an individual's rights under title 
II or title XVI of the Act is generally final and binding unless 
the individual files a request for review of the determination or 
decision within a specified time period. However, the time 
period to request review will be extended if good cause can be 
established for missing the deadline to request review 
(  404.911 and 416.1411). Also, under our regulations, we may 
reopen a determination or decision at any time if it was obtained 
by fraud or similar fault (  404.988(c)(1) and 416.1488(c)), or, 
in title II cases, if certain other circumstances exist 
( 404.988(c)). 
Under our regulations, a request for a hearing before an ALJ 
may be dismissed if neither the person requesting the hearing nor 
his or her designated representative appears at the time and 
place set for the hearing. However, if good cause for failure to 
appear can be established, the hearing request will not be 
dismissed (  404.957(b) and 416.1457(b)). 
We are making the following changes to   404.911, 404.936, 
404.957, 404.988, 416.1411, 416.1436, 416.1457, and 416.1488 to 
reflect the consideration of the factors described in section 
10305 of OBRA 1989. 
 Amend   404.911(a) and (b)(9) and 416.1411(a) and (b)(9) to 
provide that in determining whether an individual had good cause 
for missing a deadline to request review, we will take into 
account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations of the individual (including any lack of facility 
with the English language) which may have prevented the 
individual from filing a timely request or from understanding or 
knowing about the need to file a timely request for review. 
 Amend   404.936 and 416.1436 to further describe 
circumstances which an individual, who will not be represented at 
a hearing before an ALJ, may give for requesting a change in the 
time or place of the hearing. 

 Amend   404.957(b) and 416.1457(b) to require that in 
making determinations of whether an individual had good cause for 
failure to appear for a hearing before an ALJ, we will take into 
account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) the individual has.

 Amend   404.988(c)(1) and 416.1488(c) to indicate that in determining whether a determination
or decision was obtained by fraud or similar fault for the purposes of reopening, we will take into account any physical,
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual
has. 



Good Cause for Refusal To Accept Rehabilitation Services 



Under sections 222(b) and 1615(c) of the Act and the implementing regulations at   404.422 and 416.1328,
deductions may be imposed against title II benefits, or title XVI benefits may be suspended, if a disabled or blind
beneficiary refuses without good cause to accept certain rehabilitation services. If good cause can be established
for the refusal, benefits will not be affected. The final regulations amend the pertinent regulations relating to
good cause for refusal of rehabilitation services. 

The change we are making in part 416 of the regulations is based on the amendment to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act. We
are making a comparable change in part 404 in the interest of consistency. 

Sections 404.422 and 416.1715 of our regulations discuss how we determine whether an individual has good cause for
refusing rehabilitation services. We are amending   404.422(e) and 416.1715(a) to provide that in making
good cause determinations concerning the refusal of rehabilitation services, we will take into account any physical,
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual
has. We are also making a technical correction in a cross-reference contained in  416.2203 to indicate that
``good cause'' for refusal of vocational rehabilitation services is defined in  416.1715. 



Good Reason for Not Applying for Other Benefits 



Section 1611(e)(2) of the Act requires that SSI applicants and beneficiaries apply for other benefits for which they
may be eligible within 30 days from the date the individual receives our notice about any other benefits for which the
individual is likely to be eligible. Our existing regulations   416.210(e) and 416.1330(a) provide
that individuals are not eligible for SSI benefits if they do not apply for the other benefits when told to do so. However,
both   416.210(e) and 416.1330(a) provide that the individual will not be found ineligible for SSI benefits
if the individual had good reason ( 416.210(e)) or good cause ( 416.1330(a)) for not applying for the
other benefits within the 30-day period or taking other necessary steps to obtain them. 

We are amending  416.210(e)(2) to provide that we will take into account any physical, mental, educational,
or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has in determining
good reason or good cause for not filing for other benefits. Since  416.1330(a) refers to  416.210(e),
we are not amending  416.1330(a).

For the reasons set out in the preamble, subparts E, F, J, and P 
of part 404 and subparts B, E, G, I, N, Q and V of part 416 of 20 
CFR chapter III are amended as follows: 


PART 404_FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY 
INSURANCE (1950-  ) 


1. The authority citation for subpart E continues to 
read as follows:





Authority:

 Secs. 202, 203, 204 (a) and (e), 205(a), 
222(b), 223(e), 224, 227, and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 
42 U.S.C. 402, 403, 404 (a) and (e), 405(a), 422(b), 423(e), 424, 
427, and 1302. 



2. Section 404.422 is amended by adding two new 
sentences immediately before the second sentence of the 
introductory text of paragraph (e) to read as follows: 


 404.422 

Deductions because of refusal to accept rehabilitation 
services. 


* * * * * 


(e) * * * In determining whether an individual has good cause 
for refusing rehabilitation services, we will take into account 
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual may have which may have caused the individual to 
refuse such services. We also consider other factors that may 
have caused an individual to refuse such services. * * * 


* * * * * 


3. Section 404.454 is amended by revising the third and 
fourth sentences of the introductory text of paragraph (a), by 
removing the word ``or'' that follows the semicolon at the end of 
paragraph (a)(7), by removing the period at the end of paragraph 
(a)(8) and replacing it with ``; or'', and by adding a new 
paragraph (a)(9) to read as follows: 


 404.454 

Good cause for failure to make required reports. 


(a) 

General

. * * * The failure of the individual to submit 
evidence to establish good cause within a specified time may be 
considered a sufficient basis for a finding that good cause does 
not exist (see  404.705). In determining whether good cause for 
failure to report timely has been established by the individual, 
consideration is given to whether the failure to report within 
the proper time limit was the result of untoward circumstances, 
misleading action of the Social Security Administration, 
confusion as to the requirements of the Act resulting from 
amendments to the Act or other legislation, or any physical, 
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any 
lack of facility with the English language) the individual may 
have. * * * 


* * * * * 


(9) Failure of the individual to understand reporting 
responsibilities due to his or her physical, mental, educational, 
or linguistic limitation(s). 


* * * * * 


4. The authority citation for subpart F continues to 
read as follows: 





Authority:

 Secs. 204(a)-(d), 205(a), and 1102 of the Social 
Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 404(a)-(d), 405(a), and 1302.

 

5. Section 404.507 is amended by revising the third sentence 
of the introductory text to read as follows: 


 404.507 

Fault. 


* * * In determining whether an individual is at fault, the 
Social Security Administration will consider all pertinent 
circumstances, including the individual's age and intelligence, 
and any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual has. * * * 


* * * * * 


6. Section 404.510 is amended by revising the section 
heading, by removing the last sentence of paragraph (n) and by 
revising the introductory text of  404.510 to read as follows: 


 404.510 

When an individual is ``without fault'' in a deduction 
overpayment. 


In determining whether an individual is ``without fault'' with 
respect to a deduction overpayment, the Social Security 
Administration will consider all pertinent circumstances, 
including the individual's age and intelligence, and any 
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual has. Except as provided in  404.511 or elsewhere in 
this subpart F, situations in which an individual will be 
considered to be ``without fault'' with respect to a deduction 
overpayment include, but are not limited to, those that are 
described in this section. An individual will be considered 
``without fault'' in accepting a payment which is incorrect because 
he/she failed to report an event specified in sections 203 (b) and 
(c) of the Act, or an event specified in section 203(d) of the 
Act as in effect for monthly benefits for months after December 
1960, or because a deduction is required under section 203 (b), 
(c), (d), or section 222(b) of the Act, or payments were not 
withheld as required by section 202(t) or section 228 of the Act, 
if it is shown that such failure to report or acceptance of the 
overpayment was due to one of the following circumstances:

7. Section 404.511 is amended by revising the section 
heading and by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 



 404.511 

When an individual is at ``fault'' in a deduction 
overpayment. 



* * * * * 



(b) 

Subsequent deduction overpayments.

 The Social Security Administration generally will not find an 
individual to be without fault where, after having been 
exonerated for a ``deduction overpayment'' and after having been 
advised of the correct interpretation of the deduction provision, 
the individual incurs another ``deduction overpayment'' under the 
same circumstances as the first overpayment. However, in 
determining whether the individual is without fault, the Social 
Security Administration will consider all of the pertinent 
circumstances surrounding the prior and subsequent ``deduction 
overpayments,'' including any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) which the individual may have.

 


8. The authority citation for subpart J of part 404 is revised 
to read as follows:


 




Authority: 

Secs. 201(j), 205 (a), (b) and (d)-(h), 
221(d), and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 31 U.S.C. 3720A; 
42 U.S.C. 401(j), 405 (a), (b), and (d)-(h), 421(d), and 1302, 
sec. 5 of Pub. L. 97-455, 96 Stat. 2500; sec. 6 of Pub. L. 98-460, 
98 Stat. 1802. 




9. Section 404.911 is amended by removing the period after 
paragraph (a)(3) and replacing it with ``; and'', by adding a new 
paragraph (a)(4) after paragraph (a)(3), and by revising 
paragraph (b)(9) to read as follows: 



 404.911 

Good cause for missing the deadline to request review. 



(a) * * * 

(4) Whether you had any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) which prevented you from filing a timely 
request or from understanding or knowing about the need to file a 
timely request for review. 

(b) * * * 

(9) Unusual or unavoidable circumstances exist, including the 
circumstances described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
which show that you could not have known of the need to file 
timely, or which prevented you from filing timely.

 


10. Section 404.936 is amended by revising paragraph 
(d)(7) to read as follows: 



 404.936 

Time and place for a hearing before an administrative 
law judge. 



* * * * *

the notice of hearing because of any physical, mental, 
educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of 
facility with the English language) which you may have.

 


11. Section 404.957 is amended by redesignating paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) as paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) and by

linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) which you may have.

to read as follows: 



 404.988

sentence of the introductory text a new sentence to read as

 416.552 

Waiver of adjustment or recovery_without fault.

Administration will take into account any physical, mental, 
educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of 
facility with the English language) the individual may have. * * *

5. Section 416.556 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to

 416.556 

Waiver of adjustment or recovery_countable resources 
in excess of the limits prescribed in  416.1205 by $50 or less. 



* * * * * 



(b) Failure to report the excess resources correctly and in a 
timely manner will be considered to be willful and knowing and 
the individual will be found to be at fault when the evidence 
clearly shows the individual (and spouse if any) was fully aware 
of the requirements of the law and of the excess resources and 
chose to conceal these resources. When an individual incurred a 
similar overpayment in the past and received an explanation and 
instructions at the time of the previous overpayment, we will 
generally find the individual to be at fault. However, in 
determining whether the individual is at fault, we will consider 
all aspects of the current and prior overpayment situations, and 
where we determine the individual is not at fault, we will waive 
adjustment or recovery of the subsequent overpayment. In making 
any determination or decision under this section concerning 
whether an individual is at fault, including a determination or 
decision of whether the failure to report the excess resources 
correctly and in a timely manner was willful and knowing, we will 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) of the individual (and spouse if any).

7. Section 416.732 is revised to read as follows: 



 416.732 

No penalty deduction if you have good cause for failure 
to report timely. 



(a) We will find that you have good cause for failure to 
report timely and we will not impose a penalty deduction, if_

(1) You are ``without fault'' as defined in  416.552; or

to make a required report.

Requirements for Decorative Ceramicware To Be Deemed not for Food Use


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to require that decorative ceramicware bear a
conspicuous stick-on label on a surface that is clearly visible to consumers and a permanent statement on the exterior
surface of the base of the ceramicware stating that the piece is not for food use, and that it may poison food. Alternatively,
the regulation provides that a hole may be bored through the possible food-contact surface of the piece. This final
rule is intended to ensure that decorative ceramicware is not mistakenly used to hold food.

ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the regulations involving discovery procedures in HUD administrative proceedings. The
revision more clearly sets a standard whereby a party or a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party
will not be required to submit to a physical or mental examination, except upon order of the presiding administrative
law judge pursuant to a motion by the party requesting the examination and a showing by the moving party that the physical
or mental condition of the person who is the subject of the request is in controversy and that good cause exists for the
requested examination. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background

under section 812 of the Fair Housing Act. Under 24 CFR 104.500 and 104.540, any party may serve on any other party a request
to submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician, specifying the time, place, manner, conditions, and
scope of the physical or mental examination, and the person or persons who will make the examination. Relevancy is
the only explicit requirement regarding all methods of discovery provided in the Fair Housing Act's implementing
regulations, 24 CFR 104.500(b) (1992). 

The Department is revising 24 CFR 104.500 and 104.540 to conform more closely to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, as interpreted in certain Federal court precedents. This regulatory revision is designed to further
the already developed practice of Federal administrative law judges looking to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
in instances in which they construe HUD's regulations governing administrative filings and hearings. See, 

e.g., HUD 

v. 

Jerrard, 

Fair Housing-Fair Lending (P-H) para. 25,081 at 25,086 (HUDALJ Sept. 28, 1990) (Accepting analogy to Rules
41(b) and 8(c), Fed. R. Civ. P.); 

HUD 

v. 

Downs,

 HUDALJ 02-89-0322, Order at 2 (June 21, 1991) (Reliance on Rules 28(a), 30(b)(7), and 32(d)(3)(B), Fed.
R. Civ. P., to reject respondents' claim that deposition was technically defective); and 

Downs,

 Memorandum Opinion at 2 (Nov. 22, 1991) (Finding Rule 24(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., to provide guidance for resolution of
motion to intervene). 



1. Rule 35 Standard 



Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35, relevancy is not a sufficient basis for a court to order a physical or mental
examination. 

Schlagenhauf 

v. 

Holder,

 379 U.S. 104, 118 (1964). Rather, because such examinations are a more intrusive form of discovery than other available
discovery methods, Rule 35 requires stringent standards for their use in Federal court litigation. Such examinations
are only provided for by leave of court and in limited circumstances. 



Rule 35 provides: 



When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party or of a person in the custody or under the
legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to
a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person
in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the
person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination
and the person or persons by whom it is to be made. 




As stated in 

Guilford National Bank 

v. 

Southern R. Co.,

 297 F.2d 921, 924 (4th Cir. 1962), ``Under Rule 35, the invasion of the individual's privacy by a physical or mental
examination is so serious that a strict standard of good cause, supervised by the district courts, is manifestly appropriate.''
The Supreme Court, in 

Schlagenhauf, supra,

 emphasized the limited circumstances under which a court may order mental or physical examinations under Rule 35:





Sweeping examinations of a party who has not affirmatively put into issue his own mental or physical condition are
not to be automatically ordered * * * Mental and physical examinations are only to be ordered upon a
discriminating application by the district judge of the limitations prescribed by the Rule. To hold otherwise would
mean that such examinations could be ordered routinely * * * The plain language of Rule 35 precludes
such an untoward result.






Schlagenhauf,

 379 U.S. at 121-22. See also 

In re Mitchell,

 563 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1977) (Rule 35 order requires greater showing than general discovery under Rule 26). 



The requirements under Rule 35 differ from those imposed by other discovery provisions in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, such as the taking of oral and written depositions (Rules 26-32), interrogatories to parties (Rule
33), and the production of documents (Rule 34). None of these other discovery methods require that a matter be ``in
controversy'' and only Rule 34 imposes a requirement that the moving party affirmatively demonstrate ``good cause.''
See 

Schlagenhauf,

 379 U.S. at 117. In general, other discovery devices under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require leave
of court. 

Rule 35 requires that the party requesting a physical or mental examination make a motion and meet notice requirements.
For such a motion to be granted, the following standard must be met: 

1. The physical or mental condition of the person to be examined must be in controversy; and 

2. There must be a showing of good cause.

These requirements are not met by ``mere conclusory allegations of the pleadings_nor by mere relevance to the case_but
require an affirmative showing * * * that each condition as to which the examination is sought is really
and genuinely in controversy and that good cause exists for ordering each particular examination.'' 

Schlagenhauf,

 379 U.S. at 118. Precedent establishes that it is the moving party which has the burden of demonstrating that this standard
is met. 

Id.

 



a. ``In Controversy'' Requirement 



Federal precedents have varied in their interpretation of the ``in controversy'' requirement. In negligence cases,
courts generally have been receptive to defendants' requests for such examinations where physical or mental injury
is claimed. See 

Brandenberg 

v. 

El Al Israel Airlines,

 79 F.R.D. 543 (1978) (ordering psychiatric examination of plaintiff alleging negligent, careless and reckless
treatment caused her ``physical, emotional, mental stress, and mental and psychiatric injuries''); 

Martin 

v. 

Tindell,

 98 So.2d 473, 

cert. denied,

 355 U.S. 959 (negligence case indicating physical exams are granted as a matter of course in such cases). Even in negligence
cases, however, examinations may not be ordered where damages only for past injury are alleged, rather than damages
for present suffering. 

Winters 

v. 

Travia,

 495 F.2d 839 (2d Cir. 1974); 

Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 

v. 

Torres,

 255 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1958). 

In the civil rights cases, however, courts have demonstrated greater reluctance to order such examinations. In 

Cody 

v. 

Marriot Corporation,

 103 F.R.D. 421, 422-23 (D. Mass. 1984), the court indicated that the standard for ordering such examinations
in discrimination cases is more stringent than in tort cases involving negligence. 

The reported civil rights cases interpreting Rule 35 have generally involved requests by defendants for mental examinations
of plaintiffs. A review of employment discrimination cases interpreting Rule 35 demonstrates that mental examinations
of plaintiffs are not routinely ordered in such cases simply because plaintiffs may claim damages for emotional distress.
Furthermore, a claim of emotional distress is not considered to place automatically a plaintiff's mental condition
in controversy. 



Cody,

 referred to, 

supra,

 was one important employment discrimination case involving the application of Rule 35. Citing 

Schlagenhauf

, Cody refused to order a mental examination of a plaintiff who claimed emotional distress as a result of employment
discrimination. 

Cody

 indicated that the outcome might have been different had the plaintiff not merely ``made a claim of emotional distress''
but instead had made ``a claim of a psychiatric disorder requiring psychiatric or psychological counseling.'' 

Cody,

 103 F.R.D. at 423. This distinction, based on the severity of the injury alleged, has also been applied in other tort
contexts. See, 

e.g., Anson 

v. 

Fickel,

 110 F.R.D. 184, 186 (N.D. Ind. 1986) (traffic accident case citing 

Cody

 and making same distinction). 



Cody

 also noted that the moving party had shown no authority for the proposition that ``emotional distress'' is synonymous
with ``mental condition,'' as that term is used in Rule 35. 

Cody,

 103 F.R.D. at 422 n.2. 

Cody

 indicated that if, in contrast, the plaintiff were to use the services of a psychiatrist or psychologist at a later
date for use at trial, the court would consider allowing the defendants to conduct the Rule 35(a) examination. 

Cody,

 103 F.R.D. at 423. 

Thus, 

Cody

 suggested two factors that differentiate the circumstances in which the ``in controversy'' requirement would or
would not be met. 



b. ``Good Cause'' Requirement 



In addition to the ``in controversy'' requirement, an examination may only be ordered if ``good cause'' is also shown.
The good-cause requirement is not a ``mere formality,'' but is a ``plainly expressed limitation on [Rule 35's] use
* * *.'' 

Schlagenhauf,

 379 U.S. at 118.

Schlagenhauf 

noted with approval the discussion of the ``good cause'' requirement in 

Guilford National Bank 

v. 

Southern R. Co., 

297 F.2d 921, 924 (4th Cir. 1962). In 

Guilford

, the court stated that ``the Rules indicate that there must be a greater showing of need under Rules 34 and 35 than under
the other discovery rules,'' and that the requirement would be ``meaningless'' if it could be established by ``merely''
showing that the information sought is relevant. 

Guilford

, 297 F.2d at 924. Although the 

Guilford

 court discussed the ``good cause'' requirement in the context of the plaintiff's Rule 34 request for production of
documents (which the court denied), it stated the policy reason for imposing the ``good cause'' requirement of Rule
35: ``the invasion of an individual's privacy by a physical or mental examination is so serious that a strict standard
of good cause, supervised by the district courts, is manifestly appropriate.'' 

Id. 

The court further stated, ``[R]elevancy is not the equivalent of good cause * * *.'' 

Guilford

, 297 F.2d at 925. 
Other precedents establish that ``The ability of the movant to obtain the desired information by other means is also
relevant'' to the determination of whether good cause is shown. 

Schlagenhauf

, 379 U.S. at 118. This principle has been applied in several subsequent reported decisions. In 

Anson, 

110 F.R.D. at 186, a traffic accident case, the court considered the fact that the defendants had utilized other discovery
procedures before seeking a mental examination of the plaintiff. In ordering a mental examination of the plaintiff,


Anson 

considered the defendant's attempts first to obtain information through alternative means such as submitting the
plaintiff's medical records to the defendants' own expert for analysis. Other tort cases have recognized that where
medical reports are provided, good cause may no longer exist for ordering a mental examination. See 

Hughes 

v. 

Groves

, 47 F.R.D. 52, 57 (1969); 

Petition of Trinidad Corp.

, 238 F. Supp. 928, 935 (1965). 
This principle has been applied as well in cases where the plaintiff seeks a mental examination of the defendant. For
example, in 

Marroni 

v. 

Matey

, 82 F.R.D. 371 (1979), a tort case involving a child injured in a boating accident, the plaintiff requested a psychological
exam of the defendant boat operator to show that he was incapable of properly operating it and understanding safety
rules. The court denied the request holding that the plaintiff first had to utilize less intrusive methods of discovery
to attempt to obtain the desired information. 

Marroni

, 82 F.R.D. at 372. 


2. Application of Rule 35 Standard to Fair Housing Cases 


Two recent Federal Administrative decisions, 

HUD 

v. 

Ocean Sands, Inc.

, HUDALJ 04-90-0231-1, Order (April 20, 1993); 

HUD 

v. 

Ocean Parks Jupiter Condominium Association, Inc.

, HUDALJ 04-90-0589-1 and 04-90-0604-1, Order Denying Motion for Protective
Order (December 8, 1992), appear to set a standard under which a defendant may obtain a mental examination of an aggrieved
person simply because damages for emotional distress are being sought. 
The Secretary believes such a standard is inappropriate in fair housing cases. Rather, as provided for in this revised
rule, fair housing cases are governed by a more restrictive standard, consistent with the standards that have been
applied in other civil rights contexts. The Department, following the lead of courts, has commonly relied on civil
rights cases in other contexts, especially employment discrimination precedents, for guidance in housing discrimination
cases under the Fair Housing Act. See, 

e.g., Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. 

v. 

Town of Huntington

, 844 F.2d 926, 935 (2d Cir.), aff'd, 488 U.S. 15 (1988); 

HUD 

v. 

Blackwell

, Fair Housing-Fair Lending (P-H) para. 25,001 at 25,005 (1989). This rule furthers that practice by looking
to Federal court precedents construing Rule 35 to allow such examinations only in limited circumstances. 
Under the revised standard, the fact that the Secretary, on behalf of an aggrieved person, or an intervening aggrieved
person, may request a large amount of monetary relief and/or significant relief for emotional distress, would not
support an order requiring the aggrieved person to submit to a mental examination. Rather, the Department adopts
a standard consistent with Rule 35 which requires that the moving party demonstrate that the aggrieved person's mental
condition is ``in controversy'' and that ``good cause'' exists. 


a. Application of ``In Controversy'' Requirement 


The Department believes that a claim of emotional distress is different from putting mental condition ``in controversy.''
See 

Cody

, 103 F.R.D. at 422 n.2. Rather, the Department adopts the two factors cited in 

Cody

, to distinguish circumstances in which the ``in controversy'' requirement is met from those in which the requirement
is not met, where the respondent is seeking a mental examination of an aggrieved person. In general, unless one or more
of these factors is met, an aggrieved person should not be ordered to undergo a mental examination. 
The first factor that the Department will apply is whether the plaintiff has made ``a claim of a psychiatric disorder
requiring psychiatric or psychological counseling'' or ``a claim of emotional distress.'' See 

Cody

, 103 F.R.D. at 423. Generally, in the former circumstance, the ``in controversy'' requirement would be met, while
in the latter circumstance it would not be met. 
The second factor that the Department will apply under the revised standard is whether the aggrieved person intends
to introduce at hearing the expert testimony of a psychiatrist or psychologist to support a claim of mental or emotional
injury. See 

Cody

, 103 F.R.D. at 423. In general, if so, the ``in controversy'' requirement will be met but if not, the ``in controversy''
requirement will not be met. 


b. Application of ``Good Cause'' Requirement 


In determining whether the second requirement, ``good cause'' is met, the Department will require more than mere
relevancy. Instead, where there is a claim of mental or emotional distress, the Department will consider whether
the respondents have had and exercised the opportunity to obtain and present information about an aggrieved person's
mental or emotional state through other less intrusive means. These alternatives may, in appropriate circumstances,
include deposing the aggrieved person in advance of trial as to his or her injuries, using direct or cross examination
of the aggrieved person at hearing as to such injuries, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and,
where aggrieved persons have consulted psychiatrists or psychologists, evaluation of those records by respondents'
own experts. See 

Schlagenhauf

, 379 U.S. at 118; 

Hughes, supra; Petition of Trinidad Corp., supra; Anson

, 103 F.R.D. at 186. Where a mental examination is requested, the burden shall be on the moving party to establish why
these alternative methods have not been used, or where used, why these alternative methods have proven insufficient.

The Department believes that the same policy reason for applying strict standards in federal court litigation in
civil rights cases applies equally to the administrative process, where litigants should not be forced to abandon
their right to privacy by choosing the administrative forum rather than electing, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 3612, to have
the matter tried in Federal district court. The current administrative standard has been interpreted in a manner
that may make it easier for respondents to obtain orders requiring aggrieved persons to submit to physical or mental
examinations than would be the case in Federal court litigation. Such a situation, if allowed to continue, could lead
HUD complainants to elect to have their matter heard in federal court, rather than in the administrative forum, since
the differing standards would make federal courts better protectors of their privacy rights. This regulatory revision
is intended to ensure that aggrieved persons who have been victims of alleged discrimination will not be victimized
again by being made to undergo unjustified probing into their physical or mental condition by respondents while the
Government endeavors to protect their civil rights. The regulation, however, still allows for examinations in those
limited circumstances where such examinations are shown to be necessary. 
A further negative consequence of recent administrative rulings on this issue is less expeditious and more expensive
discovery and hearings contrary to the dictates of 42 U.S.C. 3612(d)(1) and (2); 24 CFR 104.500(b) (1992). See 

HUD 

v. 

Downs

, 2 Fair Housing-Fair Lending (P-H) para. 25,234 at 25,235 n.1 (Nov. 22, 1991). The cost of expert psychiatric or psychological
testimony is prohibitive in many administrative hearings. While expert testimony for both sides in Fair Housing
Act cases might be necessary to the trier of fact in limited circumstances, in general the time and expense involved
in their use would clash directly with Congress's mandate that discovery and hearings be conducted ``as expeditiously
and inexpensively as possible''. 42 U.S.C. 3612(d)(1) and (2). See also 24 CFR 104.500(b); 

HUD 

v. 

Downs

, 2 Fair Housing-Fair Lending at 25,235 n.1. Recent interpretations of the current regulation, which appear to order
examinations without the need for the moving party to meet strict ``in controversy'' and ``good cause'' requirements,
could lead to more time-consuming and expensive administrative litigation. 


3. Examination by Non-Physicians 


This final rule is revised to conform to Rule 35 in another respect as well. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35 was revised
effective December 1, 1991, subsequent to the Department's promulgation of 24 CFR 104.540 at 54 FR 3232 (Jan. 23, 1989).
That revision authorized courts to require physical or mental examinations conducted by any person who is suitably
licensed or certified, rather than limiting such examinations to those conducted by a physician, as under the literal
language of HUD's current regulation.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940112-0-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940112-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1991 Amendment to Rule 35 are particularly useful in understanding how this change
to the revised rule shall operate. The Advisory Committee Note states:




The rule was revised in 1988 by Congressional enactment to authorize mental examinations by licensed clinical psychologists.
This revision extends that amendment to include other certified or licensed professionals, such as dentists or occupational
therapists, who are not physicians or clinical psychologists, but who may be well-qualified to give valuable testimony
about the physical or mental condition that is the subject of dispute. 

The requirement that the examiner be suitably licensed or certified is a new requirement. The court is thus expressly
authorized to assess the credentials of the examiner to assure that no person is subjected to a court-ordered examination
by an examiner whose testimony would be of such limited value that it would be unjust to require the person to undergo
the invasion of privacy associated with the examination. This authority is not wholly new, for under the former rule,
the court retained discretion to refuse to order an examination, or to restrict an examination. 8 Wright & Miller,
Federal Practice & Procedure section 2234 (1986 Supp.). The revision is intended to encourage the exercise of
this discretion, especially with respect to examinations by persons having narrow qualifications. 
The court's responsibility to determine the suitability of the examiner's qualifications applies even to a proposed
examination by a physician. If the proposed examination and testimony calls for an expertise that the proposed examiner
does not have, it should not be ordered, even if the proposed examiner is a physician. The rule does not, however, require
that the license or certificate be conferred by the jurisdiction in which the examination is conducted. 




The Department is publishing this rule as a final rule without prior public notice and opportunity to comment because
the rule's content is technical in nature and limited to the practices and procedures associated with administrative
proceedings. 


Other Matters 


An environmental finding under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) is unnecessary
because this rule relates to agency administrative procedures governing discovery of evidence. 
This final rule was determined to be non-significant and therefore was not reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, which was signed by the President on September
30, 1993. 
The Secretary, in approving the publication of this rule, certifies in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory
Flexibility Act), that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The rule is a technical, procedural change which only affects operations within HUD. The rule does not affect substantive
rights. 
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule would have no significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. 
The General Counsel, as the Designated official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this rule, if implemented, would have no significant impact on federalism.

Diallate; Revocation of Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes the tolerances for residues of the pesticide diallate 

S

-(2,3-dichloroallyl) diisopropylthiocarbamate, also known as AVADEX

 

, in or on all raw agricultural commodities. EPA is taking this action because all registered uses of diallate on these
commodities have been cancelled. Therefore, there is no need for maintaining the tolerances once all commodities
treated with diallate have cleared the channels of trade.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51031), EPA issued a proposed rule to revoke the diallate tolerances for all agricultural
commodities under 40 CFR 180.277 pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a)
by amending those tolerances to include an expiration date of August 30, 1996. A 30-day period was provided to allow
for public comment.


On January 22, 1991, the last EPA registration for a pesticide product containing diallate was cancelled under the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), for nonpayment of the annual registration maintenance
fee. Because diallate is no longer registered in the United States for use on any food or animal feed crops, and a tolerance
is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for a particular food use, EPA is announcing
that it is revoking the tolerances of the pesticide diallate by amending the tolerances to include an expiration date
of August 30, 1996. The delayed revocation date will eliminate concern for a residue problem due to environmental
contamination. Consequently, no action levels will replace the tolerances upon their revocation. 
No comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the proposed rule. 


Hearing Procedures


Any person adversely affected by this regulation revoking the tolerances for diallate in or on all raw agricultural
commodities may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the Office of Pesticide
Programs (OPP) docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation
deemed objectionable and the grounds of the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the
fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual
issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requester's contentions on each such issue and a summary of any evidence
relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requester would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requester, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requester
would be adequate to justify the action requested. 


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order, i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


This final rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq.), and EPA has determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
businesses, small governments, or small organizations. Accordingly, I certify that this final rule does not require
a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Paperwork Reduction Act


This final regulatory action does not contain information collection requirements subject to review by OMB under
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Section 1886(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishes a ceiling on the allowable rate of the increase for
Medicare hospital inpatient operating costs. Prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508),
section 1886(a)(4) of the Act defined the ``operating costs of inpatient hospital services'' to include ``all routine
operating costs, ancillary service operating costs, and special care unit operating costs with respect to inpatient
hospital services as such costs are determined on an average per admission or per discharge basis * * *.''

Section 3610.3 (formerly section 3608) of the Medicare Intermediary Manual, Part 3 (HCFA Pub. 13-3) and section
415.6 of the Medicare Hospital Manual (HCFA Pub. 10) provides that, if a beneficiary with Part A coverage is furnished
outpatient hospital services and is thereafter admitted as an inpatient of the same hospital before midnight of the
next day, the outpatient hospital services furnished to the beneficiary are treated as inpatient services and are
included in the hospital's Part A payment. This administrative policy has been in effect since June 1966. It was adopted
in response to a recommendation by the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council (HIBAC), which believed it would
shorten inpatient stays by encouraging hospitals to perform some services connected with the stay prior to the actual
inpatient admission. 
On October 1, 1983, the prospective payment system (PPS) was implemented. PPS is a system of payment for acute inpatient
hospital stays under Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) based on prospectively-set rates. Under this system,
Medicare payment is made at a predetermined, specific rate for each hospital discharge. All discharges are classified
according to a list of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). When PPS was introduced, the costs related to the longstanding
policy concerning the payment for preadmission outpatient services as inpatient services were included in the base
year costs used to calculate the PPS standardized payment amount and the DRG weighting factors (see 49 FR 250, January
3, 1984). Those hospitals excluded from payment under PPS continue to be paid for inpatient hospital services they
furnish, as well as for the preadmission services described above, on the basis of reasonable cost up to the ceiling
specified in section 1886(a) of the Act. Therefore, for both PPS and non-PPS hospitals, these preadmission services
may not be billed separately from the covered inpatient admission that follows, since payment for them is included
in the payment made under Part A for the inpatient stay.

II. Statutory Provisions 


Section 4003(a) of Public Law 101-508 amended the definition of ``operating costs of inpatient hospital services''
contained in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act to include the costs of certain services furnished prior to admission.
These preadmission services are to be included in the Part A payment for the subsequent inpatient stay. For purposes
of this interim final rule with comment period, we will refer to the provision as the ``3-Day Payment Window.'' 
As amended, section 1886(a)(4) of the Act defines the operating costs of inpatient hospital services to include certain
preadmission services furnished by the hospital (or by an entity that is wholly owned or operated by the hospital)
to the patient up to 3 days prior to the date of the patient's admission. The inpatient operating costs definition contained
in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act applies to both PPS and non-PPS hospitals. As an amendment to that definition, the
3-Day Payment Window provision applies to both types of hospitals as well. Further, this provision's placement in
section 1886(a)(4) of the Act rather than in sections 1862(a)(14) or 1866(a)(1)(H) of the Act (each of which deals
with rebundling_the practice of covering as hospital services those nonphysician services furnished to hospital
patients by an outside supplier) indicates that the 3-Day Payment Window provision is separate and distinct from
the rebundling requirement and, as such, may not be subject to the civil monetary penalties that apply to violations
of the latter requirement. 
Section 4003(b) of Public Law 101-508 provides for implementation of the 3-Day Payment Window provision in
the following three phases: 
 The first phase, effective from November 5, 1990 (the enactment date of Pub. L. 101-508) through September
30, 1991, includes any services furnished during the day before the date of admission regardless of whether the services
are related to the admission. The Conference Report accompanying Public Law 101-508 indicates that this phase
simply represents a statutory reiteration of the existing administrative policy. For this reason, the conferees
did not expect that there was a need for any further administrative action by HCFA to implement this phase (H.R. Conf.
Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 701 (1990)). 
 The second phase, effective January 1, 1991, involves diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic
laboratory tests) that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission. 
 The third phase, effective October 1, 1991, includes other services related to the admission that are furnished
during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission. 
With respect to adjustments to the DRG relative weights, the Conference Report states that, ``[n]othing in this provision
requires the Secretary to take special action to adjust the DRG relative weights to reflect the additional services
that would be covered by the DRG payment under this provision. The conferees expect that no adjustment will be made
before [fiscal year] FY 1993 when Part a [A] billing data that would include the additional services would become available
to recalibrate the relative weights.'' (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 701 (1990).) 
Section 4003(c) of Public Law 101-508 specifically authorizes the Secretary to implement the 3-Day Payment
Window provision through the issuance of interim final regulations. 


III. Provisions of the Rule 


In this interim final rule with comment period, we are amending the Medicare regulations by adding new material to
incorporate the provisions of section 4003(a) of Public Law 101-508 that amend section 1886(a)(4) of the Act
and to apply the effective dates to these provisions as required under section 4003(b) of Public Law 101-508.

As indicated in section II of this preamble, the 3-Day Payment Window provision will be implemented in three phases.
Phase one is intended simply to serve as a statutory reiteration of our existing policy as indicated by both section
4003(b)(1) of Public Law 101-508 and the Conference Report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 701
(1990)). Phase two, effective January 1, 1991, specifies that payment for inpatient hospital operating costs includes
diagnostic services that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission. Phase three
specifies that payment for inpatient hospital operating costs includes other (that is, non-diagnostic) services
that are related to the admission and are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission.
Under phase three of the new law, we needed to choose between two possible approaches to the treatment of non-diagnostic
services furnished within 3 days before admission. (Phase two deals only with diagnostic services and, thus, is not
relevant to this issue). Phase one of the 3-Day Payment Window provision and our existing policy for services furnished
on the day before admission are both somewhat broader than phase three, in that they bundle all preadmission services
into the inpatient payment, regardless of whether they are related to the admission. Thus, for the phase one period,
we believe it is appropriate to follow the broader administrative policy, which is already in place. However, for
the implementation of phase three (section 4003(b)(3) of Pub. L. 101-508) beginning October 1, 1991, we considered
whether to apply this broader policy or impose a policy that follows the narrower wording of the new law, that is, include
non-diagnostic preadmission services only to the extent that they are related to the admission.

<PARENT> FR940112-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We considered that the Conference Report language (which characterizes the first phase of implementation as embodying
the existing policy) could justify continuing the current, all-inclusive policy for the day before admission, or
even expanding it to apply to the second and third day before admission as well. This approach would not require identifying
any services as being related to the admission and would not require separating out from the inpatient payment any
of the services not related to the admission that are furnished on the day before admission (all services_regardless
of whether the services are related to the admission_are currently included in the inpatient payment under the existing
policy). This approach would also enhance the program savings to be realized from the 3-Day Payment Window provision,
since it folds into the inpatient payment a greater range of preadmission services that, as a consequence, would not
receive a separate payment under Part B. Finally, by maximizing the services to be included in the Part A payment for
the subsequent admission, this approach would clearly be advantageous to beneficiaries who are eligible only for
Part A; further, even beneficiaries who are eligible for both Parts A and B would be able to avoid incurring the Part
B deductible and coinsurance charges to the maximum extent possible. 

However, we note that adopting such an all-inclusive approach for the second and third days before admission is contrary
to the clear language of the new law, which is worded specifically in terms of ``other services related to the admission.''
Furthermore, we have determined that continuing this approach indefinitely even for the day before admission only
would appear to be inconsistent with the new law's implementation provisions; unlike phases two and three, phase
one contains both a starting date and an ending date. We believe this indicates that Congress intended for the existing,
all-inclusive policy to remain in effect, but only during the finite period between those two dates. 

After considering these various factors, we have determined that services (other than diagnostic services) furnished
on the second and third days before admission must be related to the admission in order to come under the 3-Day Payment
Window provision. Further, we have determined that effective with services furnished on or after October 1, 1991
(upon the expiration of the first phase of implementation), this qualification will become applicable to non-diagnostic
services furnished on the day before admission as well. We believe that this approach most accurately reflects the
intent of the statutory language of the new provision. We realize that, under this approach, the payment made under
Part A, which currently includes the cost of all non-diagnostic services furnished on the day before admission, will
no longer include non-diagnostic services unless they are related to the admission. However, consistent with the
Conference Report language set out above, we have to date made no DRG payment adjustments to reflect the effects of
the 3-Day Payment Window provision. 

For purposes of this provision, we are defining ``other services related to the admission'' as those non-diagnostic
services furnished in connection with the diagnosis (that is, the principal diagnosis) that requires the beneficiary
to be admitted as an inpatient. We considered defining this term more broadly to include services furnished in connection
with secondary diagnoses as well; however, secondary diagnoses can sometimes include complicating events that
do not occur until after admission. Since the law specifies that this provision is to apply to services related to the
inpatient ``admission'' (as opposed to the ensuing inpatient stay), we believe that it is more accurate to use only
the principal diagnosis, as identifying those preadmission services that are related to the actual cause of admission.


Further, the statutory language charges the Secretary with defining those non-diagnostic services that are regarded
as ``related to the admission'' and, thus, are subject to the payment window. In effect, this gives the Secretary the
authority to determine the scope of the payment window's applicability to non-diagnostic services. In this context,
we have determined that ambulance services are not subject to the payment window, even when furnished during the preadmission
period by the admitting hospital or by an entity that it wholly owns or operates. The House Budget Committee Report
accompanying the payment window legislation explained that the underlying objective of this provision is ``* * *
to curb further unbundling which has occurred since the introduction of the DRG payment system * * *'' (H.R. Budget
Comm. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 250 (1990).) As a Part B benefit, ambulance services (unlike patient transportation
services furnished to inpatients) are not bundled with inpatient services and, thus, have not been subject to the
actions taken to maximize payment under PPS, which prompted Congress's concern. Thus, we believe that ambulance
services are distinct from the type of hospital services that Congress designed the payment window provision to address.
Many hospitals that operate ambulance services do so at a loss. The hospitals continue to furnish the ambulance services
primarily as a means of assuring access to hospital care for individuals who otherwise would be unable to reach hospitals.
Subjecting hospitals that operate ambulance services to still greater fiscal constraints under the payment window
provision could have a major adverse impact on their availability, particularly in remote rural areas. Therefore,
in this rule, we are defining the preadmission services that are subject to the payment window provision as not including
ambulance services.

Based on our interpretation of the law, we will implement phases two and three of the 3-Day Payment Window provision
set forth in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act and section 4003(b) of Public Law 101-508 by revising regulations
concerning payment to PPS hospitals ( 412.2) and non-PPS hospitals ( 413.40) for inpatient hospital
services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. (We are not amending the regulations with respect to phase one since,
as discussed previously, the Conference Report language indicates that this phase simply embodies our existing
policy and requires no further administrative action to implement.) Specifically, we are adding paragraph (c)(5)
to  412.2 and revising  413.40(c). We will specify that payment for inpatient operating costs for both
PPS and non-PPS hospitals will include certain preadmission services furnished by the hospital or by an entity wholly
owned or operated by the hospital to the patient during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of the patient's admission.
We are interpreting the phrase ``wholly'' owned or operated to include any entity for which the hospital itself is
the sole owner; for purposes of consistency, we are also including in this term any entity for which the hospital is
the sole operator. We note that a hospital need not exercise administrative control over a facility in order to operate
it. An operator implements facility policies, but does not necessarily make the policies; operating a facility simply
involves conducting the facility's day-to-day activities, as opposed to ``control,'' which involves the power
to direct the facility's operations toward specific objectives. 

Thus,   412.2 and 413.40 will specify that payment for inpatient operating costs for both PPS and non-PPS
hospitals will include the following services (other than ambulance services): 

 Diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests) furnished on or after January 1, 1991.


 Other services related to the admission furnished on or after October 1, 1991. 

We will define other services related to the admission to include those non-diagnostic services furnished in connection
with the principal diagnosis that requires the beneficiary to be admitted as an inpatient. We invite comments on our
use of this definition to identify admission-related services. We also invite comments on the feasibility of prescribing
more detailed operational procedures in the regulations. For example, one possible approach might be simply to presume
that certain specific types of preadmission services (such as chronic maintenance dialysis) are never related to
the subsequent admission, or to presume that all preadmission services (other than certain specified exceptions)
are admission-related. Another alternative might be to develop an inclusive list of procedures which are medically
related, against which all claims could be electronically screened. Still another approach could be to define as
related to the principal diagnosis any services that fall within the same major diagnostic category (MDC) as used
under PPS. In establishing a degree of medical relatedness, the MDC approach would have the advantage of administrative
simplicity for hospitals, contractors, and the government, as it would use a patient classification system that
is already in place for hospital services under PPS. We invite comments on the feasibility of prescribing these or
other implementation procedures in the regulations, as well as the relative administrative burden that each type
of approach would impose on the program to develop and implement and on the facilities to comply. 

In response to the changes made by section 4003 of Public Law 101-508, instructions were published in the Medicare
Intermediary Manual, Part 3 (HCFA Pub. 13-3), ``Claims Process'' in March 1992 (Transmittal No. 1565) and in
the Medicare Hospital Manual (HCFA Pub. 10), in March 1992 (Transmittal No. 633). 

We note that we are making some conforming technical changes to   412.2 (c)(3) and (c)(4), 412.73(c)(1),
412.98(b), and 413.40 (a)(3) and (i)(3). 



IV. Other Required Information 



A. Effective Dates 



The effective date of this interim final rule with comment period is January 12, 1994. As discussed previously, the
Conference Report language indicates that the changes made by section 4003(b)(1) of Public Law 101-508 (which
are effective from November 5, 1990, through September 30, 1991) simply embody our existing policy and require no
further administrative action to implement; thus, we are not amending the regulations with respect to this aspect
of the provision. Changes made by section 4003(b)(2) of Public Law 101-508 that include as inpatient hospital
services those diagnostic services that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission
are applicable for services furnished on or after January 1, 1991. Changes made by section 4003(b)(3) of Public Law
101-508 that include as inpatient hospital services any other services related to the admission furnished
during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission are applicable for services furnished on or after October
1, 1991. 



B. Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and 30-Day Delay in the Effective Date 



We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for a regulation to provide a period for public comment. However
we may waive that procedure if we find good cause that prior notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or
contrary to public interest. In addition, section 1871(b)(2)(A) of the Act provides that the notice of proposed rulemaking
is not required if a statute specifically permits a regulation to be issued in interim final form. Section 4003(c)
of Public Law 101-508 permits the Secretary to publish the regulations, which will implement the 3-Day Payment
Window provision, on an interim final basis. Therefore, we are implementing this interim final rule with comment
period without first issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. Nonetheless, we are providing a 60-day period for public
comment, as indicated at the beginning of this interim final rule.

In addition, we normally provide a delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may
waive the delay in the effective date if we find good cause that adherence to this procedure would be impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to public interest. We believe that it is unnecessary to provide a 30-day delay in the effective
date since the Conference Report language, as discussed previously, indicates that no further administrative action
is necessary to effect the first phase of implementation, and section 4003(b) of Public Law 101-508 prescribes
specific effective dates for the remaining two phases. The regulations in this interim final rule with comment period
merely conform to the effective date requirements set forth in section 4003(b) of Public Law 101-508. Therefore,
we find good cause to waive the usual 30-day delay. 



C. Collection of Information Requirements 



This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

). 



D. Response to Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment,
we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the 

DATES

 section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document. 




VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis



A. Executive Order 12291




Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any interim
final rule with comment period that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that will be likely
to result in_

 An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;

 A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government
agencies, or geographic regions; or

 Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the
ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

This interim final rule with comment period is considered a major rule under E.O. 12291 criteria based on our cost projections
for the next 5 Federal fiscal years (FYs). The following discussion constitutes a regulatory impact analysis.

This interim final rule with comment period implements section 4003 of Public Law 101-508, which contains a
provision that expands the timeframe for folding preadmission services into the Part A payment for the subsequent
inpatient stay. The first sentence of section 1886(a)(4) of the Act is amended to include certain preadmission services,
furnished by the hospital, or by an entity that is wholly owned or operated by the hospital, up to 3 days before the date
of the patient's admission. This provision becomes effective in three phases.

The first phase, effective November 5, 1990 through September 30, 1991, included services furnished the day before
admission. This phase merely represented a statutory reiteration of the existing policy. The second phase, effective
January 1, 1991, included diagnostic services that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date
of admission. The third phase, effective October 1, 1991, includes other services related to the admission that are
furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission.

This regulation will result in program savings from discontinuing separate payment under Part B for services performed
up to 3 days before the date of admission instead of 1 day, without an immediate, corresponding increase in the DRG payments
under Part A. The estimated savings will be reduced if physicians elect to have preadmission services performed at
a non-hospital site or more than 3 days before admission.

There will be some savings to beneficiaries as a result of shifting payment for services from Part B outpatient to Part
A inpatient rates. Beneficiaries are responsible for 20 percent copayment for non-diagnostic outpatient services.
Beneficiaries will not be responsible for copayment if the same services are performed up to 3 days before the date
of a hospital admission and are folded into the hospital's inpatient payment. However, because we do not have a breakdown
of the cost or type of services that will be included in the inpatient payment, we are not able to estimate the annual
savings that will be realized by beneficiaries.

The following table reflects estimated program savings solely as a result of discontinuing separate Part B payment
for services performed up to 3 days before the date of admission instead of 1 day, without a corresponding DRG relative
weight adjustment for the inpatient stay.








As indicated above, we do not anticipate that this new provision will cause a significant change in the timing of services
that, until now, have been furnished during the preadmission period.

We are limiting the inclusion of non-diagnostic services, even when furnished on the day before admission, to those
that are related to the admission. We believe this interpretation more accurately implements the provisions of the
statute. This means that services furnished on the day before admission which are neither diagnostic nor admission-related
will no longer be rebundled into the inpatient payment. Further, since the law permits the Secretary to define the
types of admission-related services to be included in the payment window, we have determined that it should not include
ambulance services, to which special conditions apply. As a Part B benefit, ambulance services (unlike patient transportation
services furnished to inpatients) are not bundled with inpatient services, and thus, have not been subject to the
attempts to maximize PPS payment through unbundling which prompted Congress to enact the payment window legislation.
The unbundling provision may generate a small amount of additional Part B costs; however, as indicated above, we anticipate
that the overall degree of change that this provision will produce in existing patterns of service delivery will be
minimal.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that an interim final rule with comment period will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all hospitals
to be small entities.

This interim final rule with comment period will affect all hospitals that are paid under the prospective payment
system, dependent upon the number of additional services that will have to be included in the DRG payment rate. Since
the estimated savings represent less than one-half of one percent of total Medicare funding to hospitals, we have
determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this interim final rule with comment period will not have a substantial
impact on a substantial number of small entities, and we have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.



C. Small Rural Hospitals



Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if an interim final rule
with comment period may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we
define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer
than 50 beds.

We believe the 3-Day Payment Window provision will affect small rural hospitals to a lesser degree than larger facilities
where complex procedures are performed and specialized medical conditions are treated, requiring additional preadmission
testing. Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this interim final rule with comment period
will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Consequently,
we are not preparing an analysis for section 1102(b) of the Act.

Medicaid Program; Deduction of Incurred Medical Expenses (Spenddown) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule with comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule with comment period permits States flexibility to revise the process by which incurred medical expenses
are considered to reduce an individual's or family's income to become Medicaid eligible. This process is commonly
referred to as ``spenddown.'' Only States which cover the medically needy, and States which use more restrictive
criteria to determine eligibility of the aged, blind, and disabled, than the criteria used to determine eligibility
for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits (section 1902(f) States) have a spenddown. 



These revisions permit States to: Consider as incurred medical expenses projected institutional expenses at the
Medicaid reimbursement rate, and deduct those projected expenses from income in determining eligibility; combine
the retroactive and prospective medically needy budget periods; either include or exclude medical expenses incurred
earlier than the third month before the month of application (States must, however, deduct current payments on old
bills not previously deducted in any budget period); and deduct incurred medical expenses from income in the order
in which the services were provided, in the order each bill is submitted to the agency, or by type of service. 

All States with medically needy programs using the criteria of the SSI program may implement any of the provisions.
States using more restrictive criteria than the SSI program under section 1902(f) of the Social Security Act may implement
all of these provisions except for the option to exclude medical expenses incurred earlier than the third month before
the month of application.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


States must provide Medicaid to categorical groups of individuals who are eligible to receive cash payments under
one of the existing cash assistance programs established under the Social Security Act (the Act). In addition, States
may provide Medicaid to the medically needy; that is, to those individuals who meet the categorical group requirements,
have sufficient income to meet basic living expenses and, thus, are ineligible for a cash assistance program but who
have insufficient income to pay for medical expenses. Sections 1902(a)(17) and 1903(f)(2) of the Act provide that,
for individuals applying as medically needy, certain incurred medical expenses must be deducted from income if income
exceeds the eligibility standard established by the State. The process is commonly referred to as ``spenddown.''

In the medically needy program, the spenddown process currently operates as follows: The State selects one or more
medically needy budget periods between 1 and 6 months and a medically needy income level, against which countable
income is measured. If countable income, after certain deductions are taken, is equal to or less than the income standard
(medically needy income level), the individual (or family) is eligible for Medicaid. If the income is higher than
this standard, the individual nevertheless may be eligible for Medicaid if, by deducting incurred medical expenses
(i.e., spending down the ``excess'' income), the income equals or falls below the standard.

Section 1902(f) of the Act contains a similar provision for deduction of incurred medical expenses from income. This
spenddown applies to categorically needy and medically needy aged, blind, and disabled individuals in States using
more restrictive eligibility criteria than those of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. These States
are known as section 1902(f) States. In those States, section 1902(f) of the Act requires that, in determining how
much income is to be counted when determining eligibility, the Medicaid agency must deduct from income: (1) any SSI
benefit received; and (2) any additional benefit paid by the State. If, after these deductions are taken, income is
equal to or less than the State established income standard, the individual is eligible for Medicaid. If income is
higher than the standard, the agency must deduct incurred medical expenses from the individual's countable income
to determine whether or not he or she is eligible.

States using section 1902(f) criteria may elect to have medically needy programs. Individuals who become eligible
for Medicaid by meeting the section 1902(f) spenddown are categorically needy unless the section 1902(f) State has
a medically needy program. In section 1902(f) States with medically needy programs, an individual who spends down
in order to meet the income test will be either medically needy or categorically needy. If he or she is an SSI or State
supplement recipient, or meets the income test for SSI or a State supplement, he or she will be categorically needy.
Otherwise, when the individual spends down, he or she will be medically needy. Once a section 1902(f) State elects
to use more restrictive standards than those which the State is otherwise obligated to use under title XIX for those
who will qualify as medically needy, its spenddown rules are governed by section 1902(f).

The statutory authority behind the general medically needy and section 1902(f) spenddowns is different. Under the
general medically needy spenddown in section 1902(a)(17), States must take into account, except to the extent prescribed
by the Secretary, the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law.
Under section 1902(f), the spenddown language is broader. That is, the Secretary has not been granted the same authority
to impose a limit: States must deduct from an individual's countable income incurred expenses for medical care as
recognized under State law. However, section 1902(f) allows States to limit the deductible amount of expenses by
recognizing only the limited amount under State law.

All States are currently required by section 1902(a)(34) of the Act to provide Medicaid benefits 3 months prior to
the month in which an application is filed, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are that the individual
(a) received covered services under the State plan at any time during that 3-month period, and (b) would have been eligible
for Medicaid at the time services were received if he or she had applied.

II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule


Summary of Provisions


On September 2, 1983, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (48 FR 39959) a proposed rule (NPRM) to solicit comments on five sets of proposed changes to spenddown procedures (Provisions
A through E, as described below). Our proposals are summarized below.

We proposed that all States with medically needy programs, including those using more restrictive eligibility criteria
than SSI under section 1902(f) of the Act, be permitted to choose option A. In the NPRM we specified that a literal interpretation
of section 1902(f) of the Act would prevent these States from implementing the remaining options (Provisions B through
E).



Provision A_Allow States to Consider Projected Institutional Expenses at the Medicaid Rate as Incurred Medical
Expenses



We proposed that all States, including those using more restrictive eligibility criteria than SSI, be permitted
to count as incurred medical expenses in calculating whether spenddown requirements are met, projected institutional
expenses (not subject to payment by a third party) at the Medicaid reimbursement rate instead of using only the private
patient rate, as is currently required.



Provision B_Allow States To Combine Retroactive and Prospective Medically Needy Budget Periods



For those States that choose to have a medically needy program, we proposed the use of more flexible budget periods.
These are periods over which an individual's income and medical expenses are compared to the State's medically needy
income level to determine whether or not the individual is eligible. Specifically, States would be able to choose
a medically needy budget period of up to 6 months that could include all or part of the 3-month period before an application
for Medicaid (the retroactive period). Under current regulations, the 3-month retroactive period must be treated
separately from whatever prospective budget period is chosen by the State.



Provision C_Permit States To Exclude from Incurred Medical Expenses Those Bills for Services Furnished More Than
3 Months Before a Medicaid Application



Except for current payments on older bills not previously applied in the spenddown process, we proposed that States
be permitted to exclude from incurred medical expenses those bills for services furnished more than 3 months before
the month of application or redetermination. Current regulations and policy require that States deduct all incurred
expenses that an individual incurs before application, regardless of the date of the service, if they have not already
been used in another budget period, if the individual is still liable for them, or if the individual has paid for them
in the current budget period.



Provision D_Permit States to Apply Incurred Medical Expenses to the Spenddown Process in Chronological Order.



We proposed that States with a medically needy program may deduct incurred medical expenses from income in chronological
order, rather than in the order specified in current regulations, which is by type of expenditure. The chronological
order the State chooses can be either the order in which the services are furnished, or the order in which the bills are
presented to the agency.



Provision E_Allow States To Limit Deductible Medical Expenses to Services Covered Under the State Plan



We proposed to allow States to exclude services that are not covered in their State plan from incurred medical expenses,
except for Medicare and health insurance premiums, Medicaid deductibles, copayments or similar cost-sharing charges
imposed by health insurance. Current regulations require that States deduct all incurred medical expenses recognized
under State law that are not subject to payment by a third party.



Revision of NPRM Scope



We have decided to withdraw Provision E from all States. We explain our reasons under the analysis and response to public
comments section of this preamble.



III. Analysis and Response to Public Comments



In response to our request for comments on the September 2, 1983, NPRM, we received 107 letters, 32 from client advocacy
groups, 26 from individuals, 18 from providers or provider organizations, 15 from State governmental agencies,
13 from legal advocacy groups, and 3 from religious affiliated groups. The specific comments are grouped according
to the five provisions identified in the NPRM.

Comments on Specific Provisions of the NPRM 


Provision A_Allow States to Consider Projected Institutional Expenses at the Medicaid Rate as Incurred Medical
Expenses


It should also be noted that Provision A does not govern implementation of section 1929(b)(3) of the Act, which permits
States to project medical expenses in determining eligibility for medical assistance for home and community care
under section 1929. Regulations governing section 1929 will be published separately. 


Comment: 

Several commenters objected to Provision A, believing that allowing States to project institutional expenses at
the Medicaid rate contravenes the law. They believe that since the law requires accounting for ``incurred'' expenses
and since expenses are incurred at the private patient payment rate, a projection of expenses, as a part of accounting
for incurred expenses, should only be at the private patient payment rate. 


Response:

 We do not agree with the commenters. In the preamble to the NPRM, we noted that ``[i]t is currently permissible for States
to project anticipated institutional expenses at the private patient rate'' but that we were proposing to revise
regulations to also ``provide that States may count institutional expenses (not subject to payment by a third party)
at the Medicaid reimbursement rate instead of the private payment rate in calculating spenddown.'' (48 FR 39960).
As discussed in more detail below, we have analyzed the issue further and have concluded that it is inappropriate to
project expenses at the private patient payment rate. 
First, the spenddown rules in sections 1902(a)(17) and 1902(f) of the Act provide for reducing income by ``incurred''
expenses (i.e., expenses for which the individual is liable). Under these provisions, the Secretary does not have
to allow States to project any expenses since projection involves treating an expense as incurred before the liability
arises. However, States are permitted to project expenses under the Secretary's general rulemaking authority in
sections 1102 and 1902(a)(4) of the Act because projection may be necessary for the efficient operation of the Medicaid
program. 
The assumption underlying the projection of expenses is that liability for the expenses will subsequently arise
since only the amounts for which the individual is ultimately liable can be used to reduce income. However, when the
private patient payment rate is higher than the Medicaid rate and expenses are projected at the private payment rate,
liability for the projected expenses may not actually arise. That is, once expenses are projected and spenddown liability
is met, the provider may charge expenses only at the Medicaid rate as specified in  447.15. Thus, expenses projected
at the private payment rate will actually be incurred at the Medicaid rate, and the State will need to reconcile the
amounts accordingly. This reconciliation would make the projection at the private payment rate less efficient than
if the projection were done initially at the Medicaid rate. Further, when expenses ultimately incurred at the Medicaid
rate are insufficient to meet the person's spenddown liability, the determination of eligibility would have been
in error. Only using the Medicaid rate to project expenses avoids these problems. Therefore, we are allowing projections
only at the Medicaid reimbursement rate. 


Comment: 

A number of commenters argued that the use of the Medicaid reimbursement rate is arbitrary and generally less than
the private rate. 


Response:

 States are required by section 1902(a)(13)(A) of the Act to pay for long-term care services using rates that are reasonable
and adequate to meet the costs that efficiently and economically operated facilities must incur to provide care that
conforms to applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards. We are clarifying
in these final regulations at   435.831(g)(1), 435.831(i), 436.831(g)(1), and 436.831(i) that States
may project institutional expenses only at the Medicaid rate. 


Comment:

 Many commenters were concerned that if a State uses the Medicaid rate rather than the private rate in the spenddown
process, it could take longer to reduce excess income using the usually lower Medicaid rate. Thus, it would delay eligibility.
A number of commenters were concerned that certain individuals may have insufficient income to pay the private institutional
rate, yet have income in excess of the Medicaid reimbursement rate.

Response:

 As we proposed, an individual is eligible whenever incurred medical expenses, including projected institutional
expenses, equal or exceed the individual's excess income over the State's income standard. (The amount of income
exceeding the State's income standard is referred to as an individual's spenddown liability.) In some instances
the amount of projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate may not be enough to meet the individual's spenddown
liability. In that case, the individual remains ineligible. However, the individual will become eligible when actually
incurred institutional expenses at the private rate reduce income enough to establish eligibility. 
As indicated in response to an earlier comment, the State Medicaid rate is the appropriate amount to use in projecting
expenses because it reduces the need to reconcile projected and actually incurred expenses and helps to avoid erroneous
determinations of eligibility. If an individual is not eligible because his or her spenddown liability exceeds institutional
expenses projected over the budget period at the Medicaid rate, the State must determine eligibility based on deducting
actually incurred institutional expenses or based on a combination of expenses actually incurred at the private
payment rate and remaining expenses projected at the Medicaid rate. (If eligibility results and eligibility is retroactive
to the first day of the month because the State provides coverage in whole months, expenses incurred at the private
payment rate prior to the determination of eligibility remain valid. Ordinarily, a participating provider may charge
an eligible individual no more than the Medicaid rate. However, these charges need not be adjusted since the charges
were incurred at the private payment rate and since the charges were part of expenses needed to qualify the individual
for Medicaid under the spenddown. Otherwise, the adjustment could result in the individual no longer being eligible
for Medicaid during the month. Furthermore, unless required under State law or the terms of the State's provider agreement,
Medicaid providers need not accept all Medicaid eligible individuals as Medicaid patients. Thus, during the period
prior to the determination of Medicaid eligibility, the provider could be viewed as only accepting the patient as
a private payment patient. Charges incurred after the determination of eligibility may not exceed the Medicaid rate.)






Example:

 The individual is in the institution as of the first day of the month. The monthly spenddown liability is $1,500. The
projected Medicaid rate for the month is $1,200 ($40 per day). The private rate is $1,800 per month ($60 per day). Since
projected monthly expenses at the Medicaid rate ($1,200) are not sufficient to meet the spenddown liability ($1,500),
the individual is not eligible. However, after remaining in the institution for 15 days the individual has actually
incurred expenses of $900 at the private rate ($60  x  15 days). The projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid
rate for the remaining days in the month are $600 ($40  x  15 days). Thus, as of the 15th day of the month the combination
of actually incurred bills ($900) plus projected expenses at the Medicaid rate ($600) equal the spenddown liability
($1,500) and the individual is eligible. 




Comment:

 Several commenters expressed concern that institutional providers that admit individuals at the private rate will
be paid only at the usually lower Medicaid rate. This payment differential may have negative effects, both on providers
and beneficiaries. Providers will receive less compensation under the proposal, and it may cause providers to admit
fewer potential Medicaid patients. 


Response:

 It is not clear why the commenters believe that institutional providers will be paid less as a direct result of the policy
to require States to project expenses at the Medicaid payment rate. Providers can charge patients at the private payment
rate for expenses incurred prior to the determination of Medicaid eligibility when spenddown liability was unmet.
The individual is responsible for the full amount of those charges. Providers do not have to accept the Medicaid rate
until after the individual becomes eligible. Therefore, by using the lower Medicaid rate, there may be a delay in meeting
spenddown. This delayed eligibility could actually entitle providers to the higher rate for a longer period.

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the exclusion of expenses incurred in an acute care facility when considering projection
of institutional expenses in spenddown. 



Response:

 As noted in the NPRM, we excluded projection of expenses in acute care facilities because these expenses are not as
recurring and predictable as are expenses in long-term care facilities. We believe that it is not as easy to anticipate
the cost of a stay in a hospital or to predict when it may occur as it is to anticipate long-term care costs. While acute
care facility expenses may not be projected, they are valid medical expenses and may be deducted from excess income
in spenddown when they actually occur. 



Comment:

 A number of commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to include actually incurred institutional expenses
in addition to projected institutional expenses. 



Response:

 There was no intention on our part to exclude actually incurred institutional or other medical expenses from spenddown.
Actually incurred (past) institutional expenses may be deducted along with projected (future) additional institutional
expenses. In view of the comments indicating confusion on this point, we are revising paragraph (i) in both   435.831
and 436.831 of the final regulations to clarify this. 



Comment:

 Several commenters pointed out that eligibility begins not on the first day of institutionalization as indicated
in the NPRM, but on the day on which an individual incurs medical expenses (including projected institutional expenses)
equal to or exceeding the spenddown liability. 



Response:

 We generally agree with these comments. In States that elect partial month coverage, the first day of eligibility
is the day that deduction of incurred medical expenses reduces income to the income standard. In States with full month
coverage, eligibility begins on the first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met. However, a State may
not begin eligibility later than the beginning of the budget (spenddown) period if the individual is subject to the
post-eligibility process and, under the post-eligibility process, would owe the provider more than the individual
has in contributable income. This issue can occur when the State uses either a monthly budget period or a multi-month
budget period. We are revising paragraph (i) (paragraph (e) in the NPRM) in both   435.831 and 436.831
of the regulations to reflect these points. (It should be noted that regardless of when eligibility begins in a budget
period, expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable under Medicaid. Since these expenses may
be deductible from income in the post-eligibility process under the requirements of section 1902(r)(2) of the Act,
States may need to reduce the otherwise reimbursable amount of provider charges by spenddown expenses to prevent
the transfer of spenddown liabilities to the Medicaid program. The three examples in the response to the fifth comment
below show in detail how the spenddown and post-eligibility policies interact in these cases.) 

We considered beginning eligibility in all cases on the first day of the budget period in which spenddown liability
is met. However, this option could increase State administrative burdens without advantaging recipients in cases
not covered by the exception in   435.831(i)(3) and 436.831(i)(3). Many States use eligibility and claims
payment systems that are automated to pay claims beginning with the date of eligibility. These States would have to
weed out bills from the first day of the budget period (up to 6 months before) that were used to meet spenddown liability
to ensure that their automated systems do not pay those bills. Under these rules, no such weeding is required in States
that begin eligibility with the day spenddown is met. (Note that these States would have to begin eligibility on the
first day of the budget period in cases where the individual, in the post-eligibility process, would otherwise owe
the provider more than he or she has in contributable income.) In States that provide coverage in whole months, weeding
is required only from the first day of the month in which spenddown is met to the day spenddown is met. The failure of the
individual to identify all of his or her incurred expenses before the spenddown determination is made can have an adverse
effect on the date of the individual's eligibility. In these cases, States may, but are not required to reopen the spenddown
determination and take the additional expenses into account. (For individuals in partial-month coverage States
who are subject to the post-eligibility process for the partial month, income and income deductions (e.g., the personal
needs allowance) should be prorated in the post-eligibility process to reflect the number of days of eligibility.)




Comment:

 Some commenters advocated permitting States to project copayments, deductibles, and insurance premiums in addition
to projecting institutional expenses. Other commenters argued that States should be permitted to deduct any projected
medical expense that is predictable. 



Response:

 This provision is intended to cover only projection of long-term care institutional expenses, at the Medicaid reimbursement
rate, as they are constant and predictable. 

We believe expenses mentioned in the comment such as deductibles or coinsurance, which are generally associated
with the utilization and varying costs of other medical services, are difficult to predict. Because of the difficulty
in determining what kinds of care, and what amounts, are predictable, we have limited the application of this provision
to long-term care institutional expenses. Regardless of whether States implement this provision, they are still
required to deduct actually incurred copayments, deductibles and insurance premiums in spenddown. We further discuss
State flexibility concerning copayments and deductibles under the comments and responses on Provision E.

Comment:

 Several commenters asked how a State would apply the projection of institutional expenses option if it also chooses
to combine the retroactive and prospective budget periods under Provision B. 



Response:

 If the budget period includes part or all of the 3-month retroactive period, institutional and other medical expenses
actually incurred during that portion of the retroactive period would be added to projected institutional expenses
in the prospective period. An individual is eligible if the combined total of actually incurred plus projected medical
expenses equals or exceeds his or her spenddown liability for the budget period. 



Comment:

 Commenters suggested that we revise the regulations to clarify that States may continue to use a 1-month budget period
for institutional cases. 



Response:

 We agree that a clarification to the proposed regulations is needed on this point. In regard to medically needy eligibility,
the proposed regulations at   435.831 and 436.831 specify that, ``[t]he agency must use a budget period
of not more than 6 months to compute income.'' It is clear that any budget period between 1 and 6 months may be used. However,
it was not clear in the proposed rule that a State may use more than one budget period. 

For example, under the proposed rule, a State may use a 6-month budget period for all medically needy individuals.
Or, the State may use one budget period for institutionalized individuals in long-term care facilities (e.g., 1 month),
and another for noninstitutionalized individuals. A third option would be for a State to use different budget periods
for different groups of institutionalized individuals or use different budget periods for different groups of noninstitutionalized
individuals.

We believe States should have the flexibility to prescribe different spenddown periods to simplify the administration
of their Medicaid programs. For example, for effective and efficient administration in cases where the individual
is institutionalized, the State may wish to use the same time period for determining spenddown liability that the
State uses to determine the Medicaid contribution toward the cost of care. Allowing States to prescribe the spenddown
period in these cases permits States to align the budget period used for spenddown purposes with the budget period
used in the post-eligibility process. Thus, a State that uses a 6-month period for determining medically needy spenddown
liability for noninstitutionalized individuals and a 1-month period for determining contributions toward the
costs of care for the institutionalized may wish to begin new 1-month spenddown periods for medically needy recipients
who become institutionalized. Alternatively, the State may wish to determine contributions toward the costs of
care in 6-month periods to coincide with the 6-month medically needy spenddown period used. In either situation,
administrative simplification could be achieved in some cases by using the same income calculation for both the determination
of spenddown liability and the determination of the contribution toward the costs of care. However, if a State imposes
different spenddown budget periods in different situations, the variations should have general application and
not be applied on an individual-by-individual basis, and the variations should be based on reasonable standards.
We are clarifying this point in the regulations by revising 
  435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to specify that States are not limited to the use of a single budget period,
but must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income.



Comment:

 Several commenters asked for clarification on how projection at the Medicaid reimbursement rate will be used by a
State when an individual enters an institution during the month rather than on the first day of the month. 



Response:

 As noted in the response to an earlier comment, actually incurred institutional and other medical expenses are added
to projected institutional expenses during a budget period. If the combined total of these expenses exceeds an individual's
spenddown liability, the individual is eligible on the day that liability is met (or on the first day of the month in
full-month coverage States or, if the exception in   435.831(i)(3) and 436.831(i)(3) applies, on the
first day of the budget period whether the State uses a monthly budget period or a multi-month budget period). Thus,
depending on individual circumstances, an individual could be eligible on the first day of the budget period, on the
first day of institutionalization occurring on or after the first day of the budget period, or at some other time during
the budget period, as illustrated by the following examples. 






Example 1.

 The individual enters the institution on the 16th of the month. The monthly spenddown liability is $500. The projected
institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate to the end of the month are $800 ($1,600 monthly rate). The individual
has also incurred $600 in other medical expenses before the month of application, which remain the individual's current
liability. Because the individual has $600 of other medical expenses, the spenddown is met on the first day of the monthly
budget period (before the first day of institutionalization).

<TEXT>
 



Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the individual has no previously incurred medical expenses, only
institutional expenses. In this case based on projection of expenses at the Medicaid rate, the individual may become
eligible on the first day of institutionalization (the 16th of the month). (Although the State may be a full-month
coverage State, retroactivity to the first day of the month would have no effect because the individual has no previously
incurred medical expenses.) 



Example 3. 

The individual enters the institution on the 16th of the month. The monthly spenddown liability is $900. The projected
institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate to the end of the month are $800 (one-half of the $1,600 monthly rate).
The individual has no other expenses at this time. Based on projection of institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate,
the individual does not meet spenddown. Thus, the individual will not be eligible on the 16th of the month. The individual
may become eligible at a later time during the month should the amount of actually incurred and any remaining projected
expenses (e.g., the amount after application of any reasonable limits established by the State) equal or exceed the
spenddown liability. In such a case, eligibility would still be retroactive to the first day of the month in full-month
coverage States. (When a combination of incurred and projected expenses is used, ``remaining projected expenses''
does not include any expenses that have already been incurred. Further, any expense used to meet spenddown liability
is not reimbursable under Medicaid.)






Comment: 

Commenters asked how income would be applied to the cost of care after an individual is determined eligible when the
Medicaid rate is used instead of the private payment rate.



Response: 

There is no change in the treatment of income once an individual is eligible for Medicaid. Regulations at 42 CFR 435.725,
435.733, 435.832 and 436.832 specify how an eligible individual's income is to be applied to the cost of institutional
care. For clarification, we provide some examples.






Example 1: 

An individual's monthly income for post-eligibility purposes is $925. The monthly Medicaid rate is $1,000. The monthly
spenddown liability is $600. The individual is in the institution as of the first day of the month. Since the projected
monthly Medicaid rate ($1,000) exceeds the monthly spenddown liability ($600), the individual is considered eligible
on the first of the month. Thus, the post-eligibility treatment of income rules apply. First, to account for the individual's
responsibility for $600 in spenddown liability, the State should consider as a starting point for the amount it will
pay to the institution only $400 of the $1,000 in institutional charges. However, from the individual's $925 in income,
the State would deduct $630 ($30 protected for personal needs and $600 in unreimbursable medical expenses reflecting
the individual's spenddown liability). (Income also would be protected for the maintenance of the individual's
spouse and family under specified circumstances and, at the option of the State, for the maintenance of the individual's
community home.) This leaves $295 in income that can be contributed toward the $400 in institutional charges taken
into account in the post-eligibility process. Thus, of the original $1,000 bill, the Medicaid program would contribute
$105 ($400_$295) and the individual would contribute $895 ($600 in spenddown liability plus $295 determined in the
post-eligibility process). 



Example 2: 

The State uses a 3-month budget period. Eligibility is being determined for the last quarter of the year. The individual's
monthly income for post-eligibility purposes is $910 ($2,730 for the quarter). The 3-month Medicaid rate is $3,720
($40 per day  x  31 days per month  x  3 months). The 3-month spenddown liability is $2,250 ($750 per month).
The individual is in the institution as of the first day of the quarter (October 1). Since the projected Medicaid rate
for the quarter ($3,720) exceeds the spenddown liability for the quarter ($2,250), the individual is eligible on
the first day of the quarter. Thus, the post-eligibility treatment of income rules apply. 

First, the State would begin eligibility with, and apply the post-eligibility rules for, the same 3-month period
used in the spenddown calculations. (The State may begin eligibility with the month or day spenddown liability is
met, if later, and apply the post-eligibility rules for the shorter period only if the later date does not cause the
individual's share of the institutional charges for the spenddown period to exceed the individual's contributable
income for the period.) To account for the individual's responsibility for $2,250 in spenddown liability, the State
would consider as a starting point only $1,470 of the $3,720 in institutional charges. However, from the individual's
$2,730 in income, the State would deduct $2,340 ($90 protected for personal needs for the quarter and $2,250 in unreimbursable
medical expenses reflecting the individual's spenddown liability). (Income also would be protected for any other
allowable deductions.) This leaves $390 in income that can be contributed toward the $1,470 in institutional charges
taken into account in the post-eligibility process. Thus, of the original $3,720 in charges, the Medicaid program
would contribute $1,080 ($1,470^$390) and the individual would contribute $2640 ($2,250 in spenddown liability
plus $390 determined in the post-eligibility process).

Example 3:

 An individual's monthly income for post-eligibility purposes is $1,820. The monthly Medicaid rate is $1,200 ($40
per day), and the private rate is $1,800 ($60 per day). The monthly spenddown liability is $1,500. The individual is
in the institution as of the first day of the month and the State projects institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate.


Since projected monthly expenses as of the first day of the month at the Medicaid rate ($1,200) are not sufficient to
meet the spenddown liability ($1,500), the individual is not eligible. However, after remaining in the institution
for 15 days the individual has actually incurred expenses of $900 at the private rate ($60  x  15 days). The projected
institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate for the remaining days in the month are $600 ($40  x  15 days). Thus,
as of the 15th day of the month, the individual is eligible and the rules on post-eligibility treatment of income apply.

The same post-eligibility procedure described in Examples 1 and 2 apply to Example 3. Since the individual has $900
in actually incurred expenses and another $600 in projected expenses, the individual has met the spenddown liability
of $1,500. However, because the individual remains liable for the $1,500 in institutional charges, reimbursable
institutional expenses are reduced to zero. Therefore, no additional steps apply in the post-eligibility process.
The individual would be expected to use $1,500 of his or her $1,820 in income to cover institutional charges, leaving
the individual with $30 earmarked for personal needs and $290 for discretionary use. 

It should be noted that if the individual were to incur additional noninstitutional health care expenses during the
period of Medicaid eligibility, the State, at its option, can have the individual contribute more of his or her discretionary
income toward total health care costs included in the State plan. This can be done by substituting the noninstitutional
expenses (for which the State would otherwise pay) for a corresponding amount of projected institutional costs in
the spenddown calculation. The individual becomes liable for the noninstitutional expenses as part of his or her
spenddown liability and has to contribute remaining discretionary income toward the replaced institutional costs
under the post-eligibility calculation. 

For example, assume that the individual in this example incurs $200 in noninstitutional physical therapy expenses
included in the State plan and the State substitutes those expenses for $200 of the $600 in projected institutional
charges. The individual's spenddown liability of $1,500 is now composed of $900 in actual institutional charges,
$400 in projected institutional charges, and $200 in physical therapy expenses. The otherwise reimbursable institutional
charges of $1,500 are then reduced to $200 to offset the $1,300 in institutional charges that are deductible from income.
Under the post-eligibility procedures, the individual would have $290 that can be contributed toward the cost of
care ($1,820 total income, less $1,500 in unreimbursable health care expenses, less $30 projected for personal needs)
and, thus, would be responsible for the $200 in reimbursable institutional charges. The individual is now responsible
for $1,700 (instead of $1,500) in health care costs ($1,300 in institutional charges used to meet spenddown liability,
$200 in noninstitutional physical therapy expenses used to meet the spenddown liability, and $200 in institutional
charges under the post-eligibility process). This leaves the individual with $90 in discretionary income instead
of $290, with Medicaid paying $200 less.

Comment:

 Commenters requested clarification on how to apply the projection option when an individual leaves the institution
before the end of the budget period: if eligibility is based on projected institutional expenses that are, in part,
not actually incurred, how would a State handle this? 



Response:

 This would be treated by a State as a change of circumstances. Whenever a change of circumstances occurs during a budget
period, a State is required by regulations at  435.916 to make a redetermination. The State should be alert for
other changes in circumstances (e.g., changes in levels of institutional care) that could affect the projected amount
of expenses and make any necessary redeterminations. 


Comment:

 Commenters asked that we clarify how projection of institutional expenses would operate when a third party is responsible
for payment of a portion of an individual's institutional care. For example, if the first 60 days of institutionalization
are paid by a third party, could those expenses be counted as a deduction from an individual's income under the spenddown
process? 



Response:

 Except for the legislative change discussed in the note below, we have made no changes to the policy on treatment of
expenses for which there is third party liability. Thus, in these final rules, as proposed 
(  435.831(d) and 436.831(d)), we continue existing policy that only incurred medical expenses that
are not subject to payment by a third party may be deducted from income. In the above comment's example, expenses for
the first 60 days of institutionalization, for which a third party is liable, are not allowable deductions under this
provision or under existing regulations.






Note:

 Under 1987 legislation, States are required to deduct health care expenses reimbursed under another State or local
public program. This amendment will be dealt with more fully in separate regulations. 






Comment:

 Several commenters thought that the provision for projection of institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate would
be difficult to administer. They added that if there are many changes in the Medicaid rate, States would be required
to reassess eligibility. 



Response:

 As discussed in response to an earlier comment, we have concluded that the Medicaid rate is the only appropriate rate
to use for projecting institutional expenses. If a State finds projecting at the Medicaid rate undesirable, the State
may discontinue the practice of projecting expenses and instead, use expenses as they are actually incurred. 



Comment:

 Several commenters expressed the opinion that the potential economic impact was greater than what we estimated in
the NPRM and the commenters believe that we should develop regulatory impact and/or regulatory flexibility analyses.




Response:

 We reviewed our estimates in light of the commenters' criticisms and concluded that the impacts of the provision are
not such as to require regulatory impact or regulatory flexibility analyses. We acknowledge that these provisions
will result in some economic effects. However, we do not believe that the impacts will approach the amounts (e.g.,
$195 million for provision ``A'' alone) that some of the commenters estimated. Further discussion about our estimate
is included in section V (Regulatory Impact Statement) of the preamble. 



Provision B_Allow States To Combine Retroactive and Prospective Medically Needy Budget Periods





Comment:

 Some commenters questioned the statutory basis for this revision. They asked whether the statute gives us the authority
to make this option available to States.

Response:

 We base our revisions to the medically needy budget period on section 1102 of the Act, which gives the Secretary general
authority to adopt rules necessary for the efficient operation of the Medicaid program, and section 1902(a)(17)
of the Act, which authorizes us to prescribe standards for determining eligibility for Medicaid consistent with
the objectives of the program and is also the authority for the medically needy spenddown program. We also base our
revisions on section 1902(a)(34) of the Act, which mandates and describes the 3-month retroactive period for an individual
who was (or upon application would have been) eligible for such medical assistance at the time care and service were
furnished in the retroactive period. If a State uses a 6-month budget period, when it looks at the eligibility of an
individual had he or she applied at a particular time, it would look at 6 months' worth of income. The regulation permits
States to view section 1902(a)(34) of the Act in this manner, rather than considering the retroactive period as a special
and discrete period. 



Comment:

 Some commenters opposed this provision because, in their view, combining the retroactive and prospective eligibility
periods violates comparability requirements between the medically needy and categorically needy in section 1902(a)(17)
of the Act, since the combined eligibility period affects only the medically needy. 



Response:

 We disagree with the commenters' views. We believe that comparability requirements are not violated because the
Act contains different requirements for categorically and medically needy groups. This position was upheld by the
Supreme Court in the 

Atkins 

v. 

Rivera 

decision (477 U.S. 154 (1986)). The Court found that the length of the medically needy budget period (or spenddown
period) was not required by comparability to be the same as the budget period used for the categorically needy.


Comment: 

Some commenters argued that combining the retroactive period with the prospective period results in a potentially
longer budget period, which means that individuals must incur medical expenses over a longer period of time. Few providers
are willing to extend credit over, for example, a 6-month period. 



Response:

 The proposed combined budget period can be no longer than the prospective period allowed under the existing requirements
specified in   435.831 and 436.831. Presently, the prospective period may be no more than 6 months in length.
The proposal, depending on State choices, may result in a combined budget period of 2 to 6 months. Thus, the combined
budget period can be no longer than the maximum (6 month) period permitted under existing regulations. 



Comment:

 Several commenters asked how States would apply this provision when a prospective budget period would not apply.
For instance, if an individual dies after filing an application for Medicaid, and has unpaid medical bills in the 3-month
period before the application was filed, there is no prospective period. 



Response:

 When there is no prospective period because the individual dies before the prospective period could begin, eligibility
would be determined for the three month retroactive period only. This is consistent with our policy for terminating
a wholly prospective budget period when a recipient dies. In cases where an individual dies after the prospective
period has begun and the State has elected to combine the retroactive and prospective period, the combined period
would terminate with the death of the recipient. In still other cases where the individual, though alive, seeks eligibility
only for the retroactive period in a State that has elected to combine the retroactive and prospective period, the
combined period would still be used to determine eligibility. States, under policies of general applicability,
may treat the entire retroactive period as one budget period or divide the retroactive period into monthly budget
periods. Any portion of the retroactive period may be added to the first prospective period for a combined period not
to exceed 6 months.

Some commenters suggested that we revise the regulations by clarifying that the combined budget period would not
automatically include the entire 3-month retroactive period if the individual has no medical expenses in that period.



Response: 

The commenter is correct that an individual may be determined eligible for Medicaid in the 3-month period before the
month of application only if an individual received covered services under the State plan at any time during that period
and would have been Medicaid eligible at the time services were received if he or she had applied. This is based on section
1902(a)(34) of the Act and regulations at  435.914. This principle is very clearly specified in  435.914.
However, we have revised   435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to clarify that the retroactive budget period begins
no earlier than the first month in the 3-month retroactive period in which the individual received covered services.



Comment: 

Many commenters opposed the revision to permit States to combine the retroactive period with the prospective period
because States are permitted to consider an individual's income over a longer period, potentially 6 months, rather
than just the 3 months of the retroactive period. Under the existing rule, an individual who was, for example, hospitalized
and out of work for a 3-month period could apply for Medicaid after he or she had returned to work and have eligibility
determined solely on the 3-month period before application when no income was received. If the individual met other
eligibility requirements, that individual could have been eligible. Under the proposal, and these final rules,
States have the option to consider income over an additional 3-month period extending from the date of application.
When a longer budget period is used, greater income is available to the individual and, when measured against the State's
income standard, that same individual might not be eligible for Medicaid.



Response: 

Individuals may apply for Medicaid to cover high medical expenses that are incurred during a very short period of time,
as in the above example, in the 3-month period before an application, or they may wish to cover expenses incurred over
a longer period. We believe that it is appropriate to consider available income over a longer period than just a period
when acute illness may affect a person's employment or other income. Therefore, we believe the option for States to
select the use of a combined budget period is appropriate.



Comment: 

Several commenters asked why we are making these revisions when they know of no evidence that individuals abuse the
current system by manipulating the timing of an application for Medicaid to suit their needs.



Response: 

We agree that it is difficult to document the extent to which individuals may be abusing the existing system. The potential
for abuse exists, however, and we believe States should have the flexibility to control it if it occurs.



Comment: 

A number of commenters advocated giving individuals the option to choose the start of the budget period, rather than
giving the State that option. The commenters were concerned that a State might begin the budget period in the retroactive
period, counting income received in such period, when the individual may have had no covered expenses in the period.
The commenters believe that the individual should have the option of restricting the budget period to the first month
in the retroactive period in which covered services were received.



Response: 

As discussed in response to an earlier comment, we have revised   435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to clarify
that the retroactive period begins no earlier than the first month in the period in which covered services were received.
Therefore, there is no need for the individual to elect such a restriction.



Comment: 

Some commenters believed that the current method of separating the retroactive period from the prospective period
is easier to administer than the proposed method of combining the two periods.



Response: 

Since this provision is optional, States may select whichever method is easier for them to administer.


Comment: 

Some commenters suggested that we require the use of a monthly budget period instead of a flexible period from 1 to 6
months.



Response: 

Existing regulations,   435.831 and 436.831, permit States to select a prospective budget period extending
from 1 to 6 months. Administrative flexibility for States was a major consideration in proposing revisions to the
budget period. It is our view that requiring the use of a monthly budget period not only restricts State flexibility
from that currently existing, but requires that a State spend more time evaluating eligibility. Of course, States
that prefer the use of a 1-month period may continue to use it. Therefore, we have decided to retain the flexible budget
period as proposed.

Provision C_Permit States To Exclude From Incurred Medical Expenses Those Bills for Services Furnished More Than
Three Months Before a Medicaid Application





Comment: 

Several commenters noted that the Act does not place a limit on the age of bills for medical expenses to be deducted from
income in the spenddown process, nor does it authorize us to place limits on the age of bills.



Response: 

We agree with the commenters with respect to States that elect to use the eligibility criteria prescribed in section
1902(f) of the Act. Under that provision, States are required to deduct incurred expenses without regard to when the
expenses were incurred. However, as noted in the NPRM, section 1902(a)(17) of the Act gives us the authority to prescribe
the extent to which costs of medical care may be deducted from income when determining Medicaid eligibility. We believe
this authority permits us to place limits on the age of medical bills to be applied to the spenddown process in States
that do not elect to use the more restrictive eligibility criteria permitted under section 1902(f) of the Act. We have
decided to use the authority to set limits on the bills which must be taken into account by authorizing States to adopt
certain limits on which bills will be taken into account.



Comment: 

A few commenters opposed this provision because it appears to penalize individuals when providers do not promptly
furnish bills. These commenters suggested that expenses cannot be deducted from income until the provider's bill
is received. One commenter suggested that we revise the regulations to specify that the age of the expense is measured
by the billing date rather than the date the service was furnished.



Response: 

We believe that it would be reasonable for States to use the date the service was furnished if the individual incurred
(that is, became liable for) the expense at that time. We do not believe that individuals will be penalized for delays
in billing by providers because other documentation could be furnished to verify that expenses were incurred. For
example, a State could verify an expense by telephoning the provider. A State may presume that liability arises when
services are rendered unless evidence is presented to the contrary. In such a case, the State should determine when
the liability arose and use the resulting date.

We are persuaded, however, by numerous comments on this issue that a rigid 3-month limit on deductible medical bills
would restrict rather than enhance State flexibility. Note that the existing regulations and interpretations specify
that States must deduct all medical expenses incurred before application, no matter how far back in time the expenses
are incurred if they have not already been used in another budget period, if the individual is still liable for them,
or if the individual has paid for them in the current budget period. We are modifying   435.831(d)(5) and
436.831(d)(5) of the proposed regulations, redesignated in these final regulations as   435.831(g)(2)
and 436.831(g)(2), to specify that in determining deductible incurred medical expenses, States have the option
to include (or exclude) expenses incurred earlier than the third month before the month of application. The period
chosen by the State must be specified in the State plan. We are also clarifying in new   435.831 (f)(2) and
(f)(4) and 436.831 (f)(2) and (f)(4) that expenses must be deducted in any spenddown calculation for the retroactive
eligibility period if the expenses were incurred in the retroactive period, were a current liability of the individual
in the period for which the spenddown calculation is made, and had not been previously deducted from income in establishing
Medicaid eligibility.



Comment: 

Some commenters objected to this provision on the basis that it is not any easier for States to administer than the existing
provisions. Under the proposal, States must continue to assure that bills are applied no more than once in meeting
the spenddown liability, and that a bill remains the current liability of an individual.



Response: 

As we mentioned before, since this revision is optional, States may choose either to use it or retain the existing method.
There are certain advantages, however, to applying a limit to the age of medical bills. Limiting bills to expenses
incurred no more than 3 months before the month of application (or the age established by the State, as discussed earlier)
reduces the burden on the State of proving that a bill is no longer an individual's current liability. Bills older than
the State set age limit would not generally be applied in spenddown whether or not an individual remains liable for
the bill.

Comment:

 Commenters pointed out that States often find that it takes more than 3 months to determine the extent of liability
when a third party is responsible for a medical bill. The commenters suggested that these bills be dated from the point
at which liability is determined. 


Response:

 We acknowledge that there may be a delay in determining the extent of the individual's liability when a third party
may be liable for some or all of the expenses. However, we do not agree that the State should change how it determines
the age of a bill as a result. As we explained in response to an earlier comment, the age of a bill is measured from the date
the expense is incurred_that is, the date the liability arises. (We have clarified in new   435.831(d)
and 436.831(d) that an expense is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises.) The date of the determination
of the extent of the individual's liability is treated as the date the individual's liability begins. That is the date
from which the age of the individual's expenses is measured. We see no reason why the State should use any other date.

When a third party may be liable for part or all of an expense, any portion of the expense that can be attributed to the
individual with reasonable certainty should be treated as the individual's liability and included in the spenddown
calculation pending the final determination of third party liability. When there is a reasonable question of the
extent of the third party's liability, the State may, but is not required to, include the questionable portion in the
spenddown calculation on an interim basis pending the final determination of liability. In either case, the date
the individual incurs the expense in question is the date of the determination that there is no third party liability
for the expense or, if earlier, the date that the State elects to include the questionable amount in the spenddown calculation
pending the determination of third party liability. When there is a determination of third party liability for the
expense, the amount in question is excluded (retroactively, if necessary) in spenddown calculations. 


Comment:

 Commenters suggested that we use the phrase, ``3 months before the month of application'', rather than ``3 months
before the date of application''. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters as this is a more flexible approach. Therefore, we are revising proposed   435.831(d)(5)
and 436.831(d)(5), designated as   435.831(g)(2) and 436.831(g)(2) in the final rule, to specify that
States may include bills incurred earlier than 3 months before the month of application. 


Comment:

 Some commenters thought that the use of a 3-month period is arbitrary. 


Response:

 Under section 1902(a)(17) of the Act, we have authority to prescribe the extent to which costs of medical care may be
deducted from income. We believe that permitting States to limit the applicability of medical expenses to the 3-month
period before the month in which a Medicaid application is filed or to include earlier expenses is reasonable in that
it affords States some administrative relief, while recognizing that individuals may be liable for old bills. It
also corresponds to the 3-month period in section 1902(a)(34) of the Act and, therefore, is not arbitrary. We believe
that Congress' decision to restrict the retroactivity of eligibility to 3 months provides a suitable guideline for
determining how far back States should be required to look in accounting for incurred health care expenses since both
cases reflect efforts to provide a measure of coverage for services received before application is made for medical
assistance. 


Comment:

 Commenters were concerned that this provision penalizes individuals who, in trying to pay their own medical bills,
may not apply for Medicaid until they are far behind in payments, often more than 3 months after the bills were incurred.
Commenters suggested that we revise the regulations so that an individual may deduct an entire bill older than 3 months
if the individual verifies that he or she is still liable for the bill. 


Response:

 By permitting an individual who actually makes payment on old bills to deduct the amount paid toward the spenddown,
the regulation addresses an objective of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act for the medically needy. That objective is
that an individual's income for purposes of Medicaid eligibility should be reduced to cover the costs of his or her
uncovered medical care since if the individual spends this income on medical care, he or she will not have that income
available for maintenance needs. However, if the individual does not pay the old bills, the individual's income need
not be reduced by the amount of a liability which the individual may never satisfy. To give an individual a one shot lifetime
opportunity to reduce income for each unpaid bill encourages individuals to forgo making payment on their liability
for medical care. The regulation permits States to minimize this disincentive to paying old bills.



Comment:

 Some commenters (State agencies) proposed that medical expenses which may be used to meet the spenddown be limited
to those expenses that are incurred within the current budget period. 


Response:

 It would be unnecessarily harsh to limit income deductions to newly incurred expenses, especially when an expense
is incurred shortly before the current budget period. We believe the requirement to deduct income for expenses incurred
in the retroactive eligibility period is a reasonable compromise between deducting income for all old expenses and
deducting income only for newly incurred expenses. Therefore, we did not adopt the commenter's suggestion.

Comment:

 Commenters questioned our rationale for the revisions, stating that they knew of no evidence that individuals abuse
the present system. 


Response:

 Concern about abuse of the existing spenddown methods was not the motivation behind these proposals. The primary
objectives of these revisions were to give States greater flexibility to reasonably administer their Medicaid programs
and to ensure that eligibility was appropriately based on need. In our communications with States, we were convinced
that certain spenddown requirements, although originally well intended, had unintended results. Deduction of
older medical bills, for example, was difficult for States to administer, as noted in the NPRM, because we required
that States verify whether an individual remained liable for an old bill. In addition, because bills incurred before
the eligibility period were deductible only if they were unpaid, as specified under prior policy, an incentive was
created for individuals not to pay their bills. The revisions, therefore, are intended to alleviate administrative
problems for States and, by only requiring the deduction of payments on older bills, create an incentive for individuals
to pay older bills. 


Comment:

 Commenters suggested that any incurred medical expenses not deducted from income during a budget period should be
carried over to the next budget period. They suggested that the expenses be carried forward whether the spenddown
liability was met (that is, an individual became eligible) or not met (that is, expenses were insufficient to meet
the spenddown requirement) during the first budget period. 


Response:

 We agree, in part, with the commenters. When an individual's incurred expenses exceed his or her spenddown liability
(that is, the person becomes eligible without deducting all of the expenses) and when the excess expenses are unpaid,
the excess expenses are deductible from excess income in subsequent budget periods, but only under certain conditions.
HCFA requires the carryover of excess (that is, unused) expenses to account more fully for incurred unreimbursable
expenses in determining whether the Medicaid income standard is met. If States were not required to carry over excess
expenses, the spenddown provision would be practically meaningless when an individual with a small monthly amount
of excess income incurs a large medical expense. In such a case, the individual could only apply the small amount of
excess income in 1 month based on that expense. We have concluded that such a result would not be in keeping with the objective
of the spenddown provision to account for unreimbursable expenses incurred for necessary care recognized under
State law. Therefore, this final rule provides that medical expenses not deducted from income during one budget period
must be carried over and deducted in the succeeding budget periods under the conditions described below. 
Proposed   435.831(d)(6) and 436.831(d)(6) (designated as   435.831(f)(3) and 436.831(f)(3)
in the final rule) provide that medical expenses not deducted from income during one budget period must be carried
over and deducted in the next budget period. These proposed rules were applicable, however, only when the individual
was eligible in the first budget period after meeting the spenddown liability. We are revising what are now   435.831(f)(3)
and 436.831(f)(3) to clarify when excess, unpaid expenses are deductible in subsequent budget periods. In order
for excess expenses to be carried over under this provision, eligibility must be established for the budget period
in which the excess expenses were unused and in each subsequent budget period in which any part of the excess remains
unused; in addition, the spenddown provision must apply in each such subsequent period. (To relieve States of the
burden of carrying over such excess expenses indefinitely, specific excess amounts need not be carried over beyond
the first subsequent period in which there is no eligibility or no excess income.) 
It should be noted that the ``carryover'' concept is used in these regulations to describe the ongoing deduction of
unused and unpaid expenses, as contrasted to the deduction of expenses based on their being incurred in the retroactive
eligibility period or, at State option, earlier. We make a distinction between the two kinds of expenses because of
the option for States to disregard old expenses (i.e., expenses incurred prior to the retroactive eligibility period).
One of the reasons for allowing old expenses to be disregarded is the administrative difficulty States may encounter
in verifying and documenting whether liability for the expense continues. Once an old, or current, expense is initially
verified and documented, it should not be unduly difficult to determine the extent of continuing liability from one
budget period to another as long as the agency is maintaining contact with the individual. For this reason, we require
that the unused, unpaid portion of such expenses be carried over from one budget period to the next, but only for as long
as the individual is eligible in each such period (ensuring continuing contact with the agency). On this basis, we
are providing that deductible expenses incurred before the month of application may become carryover expenses if
they remain unused and unpaid after eligibility is established. The limit a State may place on the deductibility of
expenses incurred before the retroactive eligibility period does not affect how long expenses remain deductible
under the carryover provision. The age limit that can be placed on old expenses relates to how long before the retroactive
eligibility period expenses can be incurred and be deductible rather than to how long they remain deductible thereafter.



Comment:

 Commenters suggested that we revise the regulations so that both paid and unpaid bills may be carried over from one
budget period to the next. 


Response:

 We do not agree with the views of the commenters on this point. The spenddown process is based on the principle that an
individual's actual income is reduced by incurred medical expenses (that is, expenses for which he or she is liable)
to the point at which his or her income is equal to or below the State's medically needy income standard. Once the individual
is determined eligible for Medicaid, the State Medicaid program pays medical expenses covered under its State plan
that were not used to satisfy the spenddown. The individual remains liable for payment of incurred bills that he or
she deducted in the spenddown process.

When an individual pays a bill, his or her income (or resources) is reduced, thus reducing the countable amount of remaining
income (or resources) in determining whether the individual is eligible (or remains eligible) for medical assistance.
Therefore, there is less justification for deducting the payment in a later spenddown calculation. In contrast,
an enforceable unpaid bill remains a current claim on the individual's income or resources that should be taken into
account when the payment is made. 



Comment

: Commenters suggested that individuals should be able to carry over not only noncovered medical expenses from one
budget period to the next, as we proposed in   435.831(d)(6) and 436.831(d)(6), but also expenses covered
under the State plan. 



Response

: When an individual is determined eligible, with the exception of bills deducted in spenddown, medically necessary
expenses covered under the State plan are normally paid by Medicaid. Hence, there would be no covered expenses to carry
over. In a State that places payment limits on the amount, duration or scope of services included in the State plan,
however, bills for services that exceed the State's limits are not paid by Medicaid, even though the services are included
in the State plan. In this situation, there would be unreimbursed noncovered expenses. Expenses exceeding amount,
duration or scope limits (like unpaid, unused old bills the State elects to deduct) must be carried over and deducted
from income in the next budget period when an individual is eligible in the immediately preceding budget period (or
periods). 



Comment

: Some commenters suggested that we define current payments on old bills to include only those bills being repaid on
a negotiated payment schedule. 



Response

: We have defined ``current payments'' in   435.831(f)(5) and 436.831(f)(5) to mean only those payments
made in the current budget period. Our intent in proposing that current payments on old bills be counted as deductions
from income was to provide an incentive for individuals to pay those old bills, no matter how small the payments might
be. We believe that to count only payments made on a negotiated payment schedule would act as a disincentive for individuals
to repay the old bills not subject to a payment schedule. 



Comment

: Some commenters objected to this provision on the basis that placing limits on the age of bills which can be deducted
in spenddown acts as a disincentive for individuals to pay old bills. 



Response

: We do not believe there is a greater disincentive for individuals to pay old bills under the proposal than under the
policy in existence at the time of the proposed rule or under the existing method. In fact, the policy in existence at
the time of the proposed rule specified that bills incurred before the eligibility period could be deducted from income
only if they were unpaid. Current policy allows current payments and unpaid bills to be deducted. This appears to be
a direct incentive for individuals not to pay old bills. Therefore, we believe no revisions are necessary with regard
to this comment. 



Provision D_Permit States To Apply Incurred Medical Expenses to the Spenddown Period in Chronological Order 





Comment

: Commenters argued that the Act does not authorize us to revise regulations to permit States to deduct medical expenses
in chronological order. 



Response

: As noted earlier, we have authority under section 1902(a)(17) of the Act to prescribe the extent to which medical
costs may be deducted from income for the medically needy. This covers the order in which incurred medical expenses
will be counted. 



Comment

: Some commenters proposed that this provision be extended to States using more restrictive eligibility criteria
than SSI, under section 1902(f) of the Act. 



Response

: We believe it is useful to clarify our earlier, and perhaps overly broad, statement in the NPRM that this provision
cannot be applied to the eligibility process as specified in section 1902(f) of the Act.

Section 1902(f) provides for the deduction of ``incurred expenses for medical care as recognized under State law''
in determining eligibility of certain individuals. As a consequence, that deduction process must allow for consideration
of expenses recognized under State law. Section 1902(a)(17), on which these medically needy regulations are largely
based, provides for taking into account ``except to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, the costs * * * incurred
for medical care or for any type of remedial care recognized under State law'' (emphasis supplied). Thus, while eligibility
of the medically needy generally can be determined using the provisions of these regulations, the eligibility of
those medically needy in the States that use the more restrictive eligibility criteria permitted by section 1902(f)
must be determined using expenses for medical care recognized under State law (including any limitations enacted
under State law on the deductible amount of such expenses from income). However, there is nothing in section 1902(f)
that precludes consideration of medical costs in chronological order for purposes of the spenddown specified in
section 1902(f). Therefore, we are extending this option to States that determine eligibility under the criteria
in section 1902(f). 



Comment

: Some commenters objected to this provision because insurance premiums, copayments, and deductibles and other
cost sharing amounts deducted in chronological order may not count toward spenddown if there are a large number of
other medical bills incurred early in the budget period. The commenters believe that these items should be deducted
no matter when they are incurred. 



Response

: Many States find it administratively difficult to deduct incurred expenses out of the sequence in which the expenses
are submitted to the agency or the sequence in which the services are provided. Because one of the objectives of the
Medicaid program is the use of efficient methods of administration and since the sequential deduction of incurred
expenses is one such method, we consider it appropriate to permit States to deduct expenses from income in chronological
order. 



Comment

: Some commenters suggested that the proposal is inequitable because individuals with identical medical bills during
a budget period, when deducted in chronological order, can have different eligibility determinations. 



Response

: First, we point out that two individuals in truly identical situations, meaning that the individuals have the same
medical bills incurred in the same order, would be treated identically under the rule. In other cases, the individuals
are not identical. They may have the same amount of medical expenses but the bills are not identical. In these cases,
assuming other eligibility factors are met and the bills are sufficient to meet spenddown liability, both individuals
will be eligible for Medicaid under this provision. The difference is in which bills are paid once eligibility begins.
For example, if one individual incurs mostly covered services early in the spenddown period, any remaining bills
for noncovered services left over after the spenddown liability is met would not be paid by the State because they are
not covered in the State plan. Conversely, if a second individual incurring mostly noncovered medical expenses early
in the spenddown period is determined eligible, any bills for covered services remaining after meeting the spenddown
liability would be paid by the State. We acknowledge that this result may disadvantage the first individual. However,
we believe that in the interest of efficient operation of the programs, States should be allowed to deduct expenses
in chronological order if they wish to do so.

Comment: 

Some commenters were concerned that under this proposal an individual's eligibility or ineligibility depends on
when a doctor mails the bills or on the arbitrary order in which an eligibility worker itemizes medical bills. 



Response: 

Eligibility does not depend on when a doctor mails bills but on the date the service was furnished; an individual can
document this date without a bill. In addition, eligibility workers are not allowed to choose an arbitrary order but
must itemize bills in the manner prescribed by regulations. 



Comment: 

Commenters suggested that the result of this proposed provision may be that individuals will defer medical care for
services covered under the State plan if they know that the State will pay for those expenses once they are eligible
for Medicaid. 



Response: 

We have no evidence that indicates that individuals will manipulate the proposed system as suggested by the commenters.
On the contrary, we believe that medical needs will continue to determine utilization of medical services. 



Comment: 

Commenters requested that we clarify the proposed regulations by specifying that there is no change in the existing
policy that medical expenses which will satisfy the spenddown include those expenses incurred by the individual,
the family or financially responsible relatives. 



Response: 

This regulation does not change the existing regulations requiring the use of family members' medical expenses in
the spenddown (except by recodifying at   435.831(e) and 436.831(e) in the final rule, to take into account
other changes made by this regulation). By making these changes, we do not mean to reaffirm the validity of this facet
of the existing regulations in cases where the courts have set it aside. Numerous Courts of Appeals decisions have
not upheld the underlying assumption of the existing regulations in the context of the standard filing unit cases.
These courts' interpretation of section 1902(a)(17)(D) preclude States from counting medical expenses of family
members (other than a spouse for a spouse and parents for their minor children). Nevertheless, the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California has held that States in the Ninth Circuit must continue to deduct the
medical expenses of family members in determining the spenddown, as long as the present regulations remain extant.
States outside of the Ninth Circuit should assess the continuing validity of the existing regulations for spenddown
purposes in light of any applicable court order invalidating the use of the AFDC standard filing unit rule for purposes
of Medicaid eligibility. The existing regulations would continue to apply to the extent that they do not explicitly
conflict with the court order. 



Comment: 

We received a suggestion that States establish a limit on deduction of projected medical expenses incurred by ineligible
family members that are not covered under the State plan. If actual bills exceed this limit, the State could credit
the excess amount in the current or the next spenddown period. 



Response: 

This suggestion goes beyond the scope of the proposal. 



Provision E_Allow States to Limit Deductible Medical Expenses to Services Covered Under the State Plan 





Comment: 

Commenters questioned our legal authority for making this proposal. They believe that the Act does not authorize
us to permit States to exclude bills for services that are not paid for under the State plan. 

A large number of commenters were not in favor of this proposal because, in their view, it might have a negative impact
on individuals, since many individuals require noncovered services. A variety of concerns were expressed. Some
commenters were concerned that this proposal would delay eligibility for some individuals if noncovered medical
expenses could not be deducted. Other commenters predicted that the proposal would cause individuals to pay a greater
share of their medical bills. 



Response: 

Except in States that determine eligibility under section 1902(f) of the Act, we believe adequate legal authority
exists in section 1902(a)(17) of the Act, which delegates to the Secretary of HHS the authority to prescribe the extent
to which incurred expenses will be taken into account in determining eligibility for Medicaid under the medically
needy option. However, we have decided to withdraw the option and continue the current policy (with respect to expenses
incurred in the current budget period and the 3-month retroactive eligibility period) because the option would have
a potentially severe negative impact on applicants and recipients. We now believe that offering States this administrative
option would reduce a person's Medicaid eligibility or the amount of medical assistance provided. Further, Congress
passed legislation in 1988 amending the Social Security Act (section 1902(r)(1)) to override a similar option we
provided States in the post-eligibility process. We believe it would be inconsistent with the direction taken by
Congress in the post-eligibility process to allow a similar limitation in the spenddown process.

Comment: 

Some commenters predicted that this proposed provision would result in increased Medicaid expenditures because
individuals will choose to obtain more costly services known to be covered under the Medicaid plan, rather than less
costly, possibly noncovered services. Further, they predict that individuals will wait to seek medical treatment
if those expenses are not deductible in the spenddown process instead of getting early treatment for a medical condition.




Response: 

While we have withdrawn this option, studies of the effects of cost-sharing on utilization and health status have
been inconclusive. Therefore, it is not clear that patterns of utilization of medical care would have been significantly
altered if we had adopted this option and States had implemented it. 



Comment: 

Some commenters questioned why the NPRM did not offer this option to States using more restrictive eligibility criteria
than SSI, under section 1902(f) of the Act. 



Response: 

As discussed earlier, this option has been dropped altogether. 



Comment: 

A commenter suggested that, for purposes of the spenddown provision, we define the term ``medical expenses included
in the plan'' as all services provided to categorically needy individuals. 



Response: 

We have withdrawn the option for States to limit deductible medical expenses to those for services included in the
State plan. Therefore, we have not considered the commenter's suggestion in the context of that option. (States are
required to continue deducting nonreimbursable expenses for premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance and for necessary
care that is recognized under State law, whether or not such expenses are included in the State plan.) 

However, while States are required to deduct expenses for services not included in the State plan, States may continue
to place reasonable limits on the deductible amount. Therefore, we considered the commenter's suggestion in this
context, and we disagree with the suggestion. (This issue does not arise in States that determine eligibility under
section 1902(f) of the Act because the inclusion or exclusion of services under State plans is not a factor in the spenddown
process in these States.) States may provide a different range of services for the categorically needy than they do
for the medically needy population. The spenddown procedures in Provisions A through D apply to medically needy individuals
and apply both for AFDC-related cases and for the aged, blind, and disabled. Individuals eligible as medically needy
are eligible for only those specific services that a State has chosen to provide to its medically needy population.
If ``included in the State plan'' referred to services for the categorically needy, as the commenter suggested, the
State would be unable to place reasonable limits on the deductible amount of expenses in the spenddown process, which
only applies to the medically needy in States that are not determining eligibility under section 1902(f). We find
no compelling program reason for such a restriction. Therefore, we believe that it is appropriate to allow each State
to define ``included services'' for purposes of applying ``reasonable limits'' to mean services a State provides
to medically needy individuals (rather than only to categorically needy individuals). In this way, the State may
place reasonable limits on the deductible amounts of expenses for the medically needy except those included in the
State plan. (It should be noted that ``reasonable limits'' refers to the amount, rather than the type, of expense that
is deductible. For example, States may limit the amount, but not the type, of health insurance premiums that are deductible.)




Comment: 

Commenters predicted that this provision will be error prone in practice, as eligibility workers and providers will
need to distinguish correctly between covered and noncovered services to deduct only covered services during spenddown
accurately. 



Response: 

We withdrew the option because of its negative impact on applicants and recipients. 



Comment: 

Several States disagreed with our proposal that States may not place amount, duration or scope limits on covered services
in the spenddown process, even though the State applies those limits when paying for services furnished to Medicaid-eligible
individuals. These commenters contended that their authority to place amount, duration and scope limits on services
they pay for under Medicaid is an extension of their authority to decide which services they will cover under the State
plan. They believe that this is an unnecessary restriction on the right to control their Medicaid program. 



Response: 

We do not agree with the commenters on this point. Under existing regulations, which have not been revised, States
may place reasonable limits on the deductible amount of expenses not included in the State plan but may not limit the
deduction of expenses included in the State plan. (Expenses ``included'' in the State plan are those for services
which are listed in the State plan, whether or not Medicaid will pay for them. By contrast, ``covered'' expenses are
a subset of ``included'' expenses. Covered expenses are expenses for services for which Medicaid will pay if furnished
to the individual by a Medicaid provider. Expenses incurred for services which are for care which exceed State plan
limits on amount, duration, and scope are not considered to be covered expenses.) The basic requirement in section
1902(a)(17) is that incurred expenses recognized under State law be taken into account in the spenddown process.
We believe that this is in keeping with the thrust of this requirement to require the deduction from income of expenses
recognized under State law when the State has also included the expenses in the State plan, even though the State limits
the amount of such expenses it pays for. We, therefore, allow States to limit the deductions only for incurred expenses
recognized under State law that are not included in the State plan. 

As we explained in response to a comment under Provision A concerning projecting institutional expenses, we find
adequate authority for this policy in existing sections of the Act. The Secretary has authority under section 1902(a)(17)
of the Act to prescribe the extent to which costs of medical care may be deducted from income in medically needy programs.

Comment: 

One State pointed out that it is reasonable to require that States deduct insurance premiums, as this encourages individuals
to continue insurance coverage. The commenter argued that it is not logical, however, for us to require that States
deduct coinsurance and deductibles on services that are not covered under the plan. An individual still benefits
from the insurance coverage because he or she must pay only the deductible or coinsurance rather than 100 percent of
the charge. 




Response: 

As we explained in the response to the first comment in this section, Congress passed legislation on the post-eligibility
process requiring the deduction of expenses for deductibles and coinsurance in the post-eligibility process. It
would be inconsistent with the direction taken by Congress to allow States to exclude these expenses in the spenddown
process altogether. Therefore, States are required to deduct a reasonable amount of these expenses from income.
We rely on the authority in section 1902(a)(17) of the Act to allow States to place reasonable limits on the deductible
amounts of these cost-sharing expenses even though no such limits are allowable in the post eligibility process.





IV. Summary of Changes to the Regulations 





In this final rule, we are making the revisions proposed in the NPRM with the following modifications based on our review
and analysis of public comments. 



1. We are revising proposed   435.831(e)(1) 
(designated as  435.831(g)(1) in this final rule) and  436.831(e)(1) (designated as  436.831(g)(1)
in this final rule) to clarify that incurred medical expenses may include projected institutional expenses at the
Medicaid reimbursement rate. We are not revising  435.732(c)(3) (redesignated as  435.121(f)(1)(iii))
to make the same clarification since that section applies to States with more restrictive criteria than SSI. 



2. We are also clarifying in   435.831(i) and 
436.831(i) (proposed   435.831(e)(1) and 436.831(e)(1)) that an institutionalized individual is
eligible when incurred medical expenses, including projected institutional expenses, reduce an individual's
income to the income standard, rather than on the first day of institutionalization as indicated in the NPRM. 



3. We are revising   435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to 
clarify that an agency is not limited to the use of a single budget period to compute income. However, an agency must
use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. 



4. In addition to other changes noted, we are 
revising paragraph (d) as proposed in   435.831 and 436.831 by transferring most of its contents to new
paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) and cross-referring to those sections. 



a. New paragraph (e) in both sections includes the 
contents of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) as paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) respectively. 



b. New paragraph (f)(3) in both sections consists of 
the contents of proposed paragraph (d)(6). 



c. New paragraph (h) in both sections consists of the contents of paragraph (d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) as paragraphs
(h)(2), (1), and (3), respectively. 



d. New paragraphs (g)(1), (2) and (3) in both 
sections contain the contents of paragraphs (d)(4), (5), and (3), respectively. 



5. We are revising   435.831(d)(5) and 436.831(d)(5) 
(redesignated as   435.831(g)(2) and 436.831(g)(2)) to specify that an agency is not required to deduct
expenses incurred earlier than 3 months before the month of application for Medicaid, clarifying that the 3-month
period is measured from the month of application, rather than from the date of application as specified in the NPRM.

6. We are clarifying in   435.831(e)(3) and 
436.831(e)(3) (  435.831(d)(1)(ii)(C) and 436.831(d)(1)(ii)(C) in the proposed rule) that a State
must deduct expenses for necessary medical and remedial services included in the State plan even when those services
exceed agency limitations on amount, duration or scope. 



7. We are adding a new paragraph (f)(1) to   435.831 
and 436.831 to show that the State must deduct expenses incurred during the month of application and any of the preceding
3 months to the extent the individual's liability arose in that period and the expenses have not been deducted previously.
We are also adding a new paragraph (f)(2) to show the State must deduct current payments on old bills not previously
deducted. 




V. Request for Additional Public Comments 





We invite comments on the bases for and the consequences of extending additional flexibility to States using the more
restrictive eligibility criteria of section 1902(f) of the Act to implement any of the provisions in this rule. Because
of the large number of comments we receive, we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. If appropriate,
we will respond to public comments received on this issue in a future 

Federal Register

 publication. 




VI. Regulatory Impact Statement 





Executive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for regulations that are likely
to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, cause a major increase in costs or prices, or meet other
threshold criteria that are specified in the Executive Order. Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601-612, we prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis for regulations unless the Secretary
certifies that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
(For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, small entities include all nonprofit and most for-profit providers.)
Under both the Executive Order and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, such analyses must, when prepared, show that the
agency issuing the regulations has examined alternatives that might minimize an unnecessary burden or otherwise
ensure that the regulations are cost-effective. 



In the NPRM published on September 2, 1983 (48 FR 39959), we examined the five separate provisions contained in these
regulations for the significance of their annual economic impact. In four of the five proposed provisions (B, C, D
and E), we could not quantify estimates, but we were confident that any impacts would not meet the threshold criteria
of the Executive Order or the Regulatory Flexibility Act. However, for provision A (Consideration of Projected Institutional
Expenses at the Medicaid Rate as Incurred Medical Expenses), we estimated total Federal and State savings of $18 million.




In light of the public comments received regarding Provision A and because of the need to analyze the effects of these
final regulations, we reviewed the analysis noted in the NPRM. After reviewing our data and assumptions, we have concluded
that the current impact of Provision A will increase from the original estimate of $18 million to $65 million. This
increase is a reflection of Medicaid program growth through 1993. 



Savings will occur in the few cases in which an institutionalized individual will not become eligible or will be found
eligible later in time because his or her income significantly exceeded the medically needy income level and the State
Medicaid payment rate was used in the eligibility calculation rather than whatever rate the institution chose to
charge. Delay or denial of an individual's eligibility will reduce State expenditures and Federal contributions,
resulting in negligible savings. Some individuals whose eligibility is delayed and who are spending down at the private
payment rate, rather than the lower Medicaid rate during that period, will spend down to the income standard quicker
and become eligible for Medicaid sooner. Further, this provision is optional and it is an option only for States with
medically needy programs that are not section 1902(f) States. At this time, we do not expect that it will be adopted
by all or most States. In addition, some States have already adopted interpretations of the existing regulations
on the spenddown process that are very close to our final rule. For all these reasons, we now believe that this provision
will have a negligible net impact. 


For these reasons, we have found that the effect of the provisions of this final rule will not meet the threshold criteria
of Executive Order 12291. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not
result in an annual economic impact that will affect significantly a substantial number of small entities. Therefore,
we conclude that neither a regulatory impact nor a regulatory flexibility analysis is required. 




VII. Paperwork Reduction Act 





These changes do not impose information collection requirements; consequently, they need not be reviewed by the
Executive Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.).

A. 42 CFR part 435 is amended as set forth below: 


PART 435_ELIGIBILITY IN THE STATES, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS, AND AMERICAN SAMOA 


1. The authority citation for part 435 continues to 
read as follows:





Authority:

 Sec. 1102 of the Social Security Act, (42 
U.S.C. 1302), unless otherwise noted.



2. Section 435.831 is revised to read as follows: 


 435.831 

Income eligibility. 


The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy individuals in accordance with this section.

(a) 

Budget periods. 

(1) The agency must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one budget
period. 
(2) The agency may include in the budget period in which income is computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period
specified in  435.914. The budget period can begin no earlier than the first month in the retroactive period
in which the individual received covered services. This provision applies to all medically needy individuals except
in groups for whom criteria more restrictive than that used in the SSI program apply. 
(3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the medically needy in any month of the 3-month period prior
to the date of the application in which the applicant received covered services, this election applies to all medically
needy groups. 
(b) 

Determining countable income. 

The agency must deduct the following amounts from income to determine the individual's countable income. 
(1) For individuals under age 21 and caretaker relatives, the agency must deduct amounts that would be deducted in
determining eligibility under the State's AFDC plan. 
(2) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States covering all SSI recipients, the agency must deduct amounts
that would be deducted in determining eligibility under SSI. However, the agency must also deduct the highest amounts
from income that would be deducted in determining eligibility for optional State supplements if these supplements
are paid to all individuals who are receiving SSI or would be eligible for SSI except for their income. 
(3) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States using income requirements more restrictive than SSI, the agency
must deduct amounts that are no more restrictive than those used under the Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972 and no more
liberal than those used in determining eligibility under SSI or an optional State supplement. However, the amounts
must be at least the same as those that would be deducted in determining eligibility, under  435.121, of the categorically
needy. 
(c) 

Eligibility based on countable income. 

If countable income determined under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to or less than the applicable income standard
under  435.814, the individual or family is eligible for Medicaid. 
(d) 

Deduction of incurred medical expenses. 

If countable income exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical expenses incurred by
the individual or family or financially responsible relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An
expense is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency must determine deductible incurred expenses
in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses in accordance with paragraph
(h) of this section. 
(e) 

Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on kinds of services. 

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income,
the agency must include the following:

(1) Expenses for Medicare and other health insurance premiums, and deductibles or coinsurance charges, including
enrollment fees, copayments, or deductibles imposed under  447.51 or  447.53 of this subchapter; 
(2) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and
remedial services that are recognized under State law but not included in the plan; 
(3) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or by financially responsible relatives for necessary medical
and remedial services that are included in the plan, including those that exceed agency limitations on amount, duration,
or scope of services. 
(f) 

Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on the age of bills. 

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income,
the agency must include the following: 
(1) For the first budget period or periods that include only months before the month of application for medical assistance,
expenses incurred during such period or periods, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been
deducted previously in establishing eligibility;
(2) For the first prospective budget period that also includes any of the 3 months before the month of application for
medical assistance, expenses incurred during such budget period, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses
have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility; 
(3) For the first prospective budget period that includes none of the months preceding the month of application, expenses
incurred during such budget period and any of the 3 preceding months, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the
expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility; 
(4) For any of the 3 months preceding the month of application that are not includable under paragraph (f)(2) of this
section, expenses incurred in the 3-month period that were a current liability of the individual in any such month
for which a spenddown calculation is made and that had not been previously deducted from income in establishing eligibility
for medical assistance; 
(5) Current payments (that is, payments made in the current budget period) on other expenses incurred before the current
budget period and not previously deducted from income in any budget period in establishing eligibility for such period;
and
(6) If the individual's eligibility for medical assistance was established in each such preceding period, expenses
incurred before the current budget period but not previously deducted from income in establishing eligibility,
to the extent that such expenses are unpaid and are: 
(i) Described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section; and 
(ii) Carried over from the preceding budget period or periods because the individual had a spenddown liability in
each such preceding period that was met without deducting all such incurred, unpaid expenses. 
(g) 

Determination of deductible incurred medical expenses: Optional deductions. 

In determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency_
(1) May include medical institutional expenses (other than expenses in acute care facilities) projected to the end
of the budget period at the Medicaid reimbursement rate; 
(2) May, to the extent determined by the State and specified in its approved plan, include expenses incurred earlier
than the third month before the month of application (except States using more restrictive eligibility criteria
under the option in section 1902(f) of the Act must deduct incurred expenses regardless of when the expenses were incurred);
and

(3) May set reasonable limits on the amount to be deducted for expenses specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and
(g)(2) of this section. 


(h) 

Order of deduction. 

The agency must deduct incurred medical expenses that are deductible under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section
in the order prescribed under one of the following three options: 


(1) 

Type of service. 

Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in the following order based on type of expense or service: 


(i) Cost-sharing expenses as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 



(ii) Services not included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 



(iii) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that exceed limitations
on amounts, duration, or scope of services. 



(iv) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that are within agency
limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services. 



(2) 

Chronological order by service date. 

Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each service is furnished, or in
the case of insurance premiums, coinsurance or deductible charges, the date such amounts are due. Expenses for services
furnished on the same day may be deducted in any reasonable order established by the State. 



(3) 

Chronological order by bill submission date. 

Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each bill is submitted to the agency
by the individual. If more than one bill is submitted at one time, the agency must deduct the bills from income in the
order prescribed in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section. 



(i) 

Eligibility based on incurred medical expenses. 



(1) Whether a State elects partial or full month coverage, an individual who is expected to contribute a portion of
his or her income toward the costs of institutional care or home and community-based services under   435.725,
435.726, 435.733, 435.735 or 435.832 is eligible on the first day of the applicable budget (spenddown) period_



(i) If his or her spenddown liability is met after the first day of the budget period; and 



(ii) If beginning eligibility after the first day of the budget period makes the individual's share of health care
expenses under   435.725, 435.726, 435.733, 435.735 or 435.832 greater than the individual's contributable
income determined under these sections. 



(2) At the end of the prospective period specified in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, and any subsequent
prospective period or, if earlier, when any significant change occurs, the agency must reconcile the projected amounts
with the actual amounts incurred, or with changes in circumstances, to determine if the adjusted deduction of incurred
expenses reduces income to the income standard. 



(3) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, in States that elect partial month coverage, an individual
is eligible for Medicaid on the day that the deduction of incurred health care expenses (and of projected institutional
expenses if the agency elects the option under paragraph (g)(1) of this section) reduces income to the income standard.




(4) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, in States that elect full month coverage, an individual
is eligible on the first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met. 



(5) Expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable under Medicaid. To the extent necessary to prevent
the transfer of an individual's spenddown liability to the Medicaid program, States must reduce the amount of provider
charges that would otherwise be reimbursable under Medicaid.

2. Section 436.831 is revised to read as follows: 



 436.831 



Income eligibility. 




The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy individuals in accordance with this section. 

(a) 

Budget periods. 

(1) The agency must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one budget
period. 


(2) The agency must include in the budget period in which income is computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period
specified in  435.914. The budget period can begin no earlier then the first month in the 
retroactive period in which the individual received covered services. 

(3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the medically needy in any month of the 3-month period prior
to the date of application in which the applicant received covered services, this election applies to all medically

The agency must, to determine countable income, deduct amounts that would be deducted in determining eligibility
under the State's approved plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD, or AABD. 


(c) 

Eligibility based on countable income. 

 If countable income determined under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to or less than the applicable income standard
under  436.814, the individual is eligible for Medicaid. 


(d) 

Deduction of incurred medical expenses. 

If countable income exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical expenses incurred by
the individual or family or financially responsible relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An
expense is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency must determine deductible incurred expenses
in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses in accordance with paragraph
(h) of this section. 


(e) 

Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on kinds of services. 

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted
from income, the agency must include the following: (1) Expenses for Medicare and other health insurance premiums,
and deductibles or coinsurance charges, including enrollment fees, copayments, or deductibles imposed under  447.51
or  447.53 of this chapter; 


(2) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and

expenses incurred during such period or periods, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been
deducted previously in establishing eligibility; 


(2) For the first prospective budget period that also includes any of the 3 months before the month of application for
medical assistance, expenses incurred during such budget period, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses
have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility; 


(3) For the first prospective budget period that includes none of the months preceding the month of application, expenses
incurred during such budget period and any of the 3 preceding months, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the
expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility; 


(4) For any of the 3 months preceding the month of application that are not includable under paragraph (f)(2) of this
section, expenses incurred in the 3-month period that were a current liability of the individual in any such month
for which a spenddown calculation is made and that had not been previously deducted from income in establishing eligibility
for medical assistance; 


(5) Current payments (that is, payments made in the current budget period) on other expenses incurred before the current
budget period and not previously deducted from income in any budget period in establishing eligibility for such period;
and 


(6) If the individual's eligibility for medical assistance was established in each such preceding period, expenses
incurred before the current budget period but not previously deducted from income, to the extent that such expenses
are unpaid and are: 

(i) Described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section; and 


(ii) Are carried over from the preceding budget period or periods because the individual had a spenddown liability
in each such preceding period that was met without deducting all such incurred, unpaid expenses. 


(g) 

Determination of deductible incurred medical expenses: Optional deductions. 

In determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency_

(1) May include medical institutional expenses (other than expenses in acute care facilities) projected to the end
of the budget period at the Medicaid reimbursement rate; 


(2) May, to the extent determined by the agency and specified in its approved plan, include expenses incurred earlier
than the third month before the month of application; and

(3) May set reasonable limits on the amount to be deducted for expenses specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and
(g)(2) of this section. 


(h) 

Order of deduction. 

The agency must deduct incurred medical expenses that are deductible under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section,
in the order prescribed under one of the following three options: 


(1) 

Type of service. 

Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in the following order based on type of service: 

(i) Cost-sharing expenses as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 


(ii) Services not included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 


(iii) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that exceed agency limitations
on amount, duration, or scope of services. 


(iv) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that are within agency
limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services. 


(2) 

Chronological order by service date. 

Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each service is furnished, or in
the case of insurance premiums, coinsurance, or deductibles charges the date such amounts are due. Expenses for services
furnished on the same day may be deducted in any reasonable order established by the State. 


(3) 

Chronological order by bill submission date. 

Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each bill is submitted to the agency
by the individual. If more than one bill is submitted at one time, the agency must deduct the bills from income in the
order prescribed in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section. 


(i) 

Eligibility based on incurred medical expenses. 


(1) Whether a State elects partial or full month coverage, an individual who is expected to contribute a portion of
his or her income toward the costs of institutional care or home and community-based services under  436.832
is eligible on the first day of the applicable budget (spenddown) period_


(i) If his or her spenddown liability is met after the first day of the budget period; and


(ii) If beginning eligibility after the first day of the budget period makes the individual's share of health care
expenses under  436.832 greater than the individual's contributable income determined under this section.



(2) At the end of the prospective period specified in paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section and any subsequent
prospective period or, if earlier, when any significant change occurs, the agency must reconcile the projected amounts
with the actual amounts incurred, or with changes in circumstances, to determine if the adjusted deduction of incurred
expenses reduces income to the income standard. 


(3) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if agencies elect partial month coverage, an individual
is eligible for Medicaid on the day that the deduction of incurred health care expenses (and of projected institutional
expenses if the agency elects the option under paragraph (g)(1) of this section) reduces income to the income standard.



(4) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if agencies elect full month coverage, an individual is
eligible on the first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met. 


(5) Expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable under Medicaid. Therefore, to the extent 
necessary to prevent the transfer of an individual's 
spenddown liability to the Medicaid program, States must reduce the amount of provider charges that would otherwise
be reimbursable under Medicaid.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comment. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment revises the regulations concerning first aid kits required on board air carrier, air taxi, and commercial
aircraft to remove the burn compound from the list of items required for the kits. This amendment responds to a petition
from Air Transport Association, supported by the American Red Cross, that the burn compound be removed from the kits
since the use of ice or cold water is the preferred treatment for minor burns. This amendment will relieve affected
operators from the expense of having to periodically replace an item in the first aid kits that is not needed. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 



On December 5, 1986, the Air Transport Association (ATA) submitted a petition to delete burn compound (burn ointment)
from the first-aid kits required to be carried on each aircraft operated under part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.
In the petition ATA noted that the application of ice or cold water is the preferred treatment for minor burns. As part
of its supporting data, the petition included a request from Western Airlines to delete burn ointment from their first
aid kits. Also included in the petition were copies of instructions from flight manuals for several other airlines
in which flight attendants were advised to use ice compresses for the treatment of burns and not to use the burn ointment
unless it is requested by the passenger. In addition, ATA stated that burn ointment normally has an expiration date,
which requires replacement, inspection, and record-keeping. 

On January 21, 1987, ATA submitted a second letter to the docket that transmitted an American Red Cross statement confirming
their position that burn ointment retains heat within the wound, causing the wound to actually worsen in some cases.
In addition, information provided by the Red Cross indicated that burn ointment must be removed before any other treatment
can be applied. 

ATA submitted additional information on April 9, 1987, in which it cited the March 1987 ATA Cabin Safety Panel meeting
where the subject of first-aid for minor burns was discussed. At that meeting, each panel member present stated that
their flight attendants were trained to use cold water or ice rather than burn ointment, unless burn ointment was specifically
requested by the passenger. Representatives of most of the major airlines were included in this group, constituting
over 80 percent of all the seat miles flown by the major airlines. 

By letter dated July 6, 1987, ATA submitted a comment from the School of Nursing at the University of Miami as an additional
medical opinion. That letter, from an associate professor, stated that emergency care for burns should begin with
stopping the burning process by applying cool water to stop the pain and slow the process of heat damage. This medical
opinion also noted that application of ointments, oils, etc., should be avoided.

The petition of ATA was published in the 

Federal Register 

on February 20, 1987 (52 FR 5309). The comment period closed April 20, 1987. The only comments received on the petition
are those cited above.
By letter dated July 6, 1993, ATA petitioned on behalf of its member airlines and similarly situated operators for
an exemption from the requirement to carry burn ointment in first aid kits as required by appendix A to part 121. A summary
of that petition was published in the 

Federal Register 

on August 11, 1993, and the comment period closed August 31, 1993 (58FR42752). Two comments were received. The Air
Line Pilots Association supports the removal of the ointment from first aid kits and notes that this removal would
facilitate maintenance by eliminating the need for purchasing, stocking, record keeping, replacing, and disposing
of the ointment. The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) agrees that the removal of the ointment from first aid
kits is an appropriate action; however, the AFA also suggests that the FAA should require an equivalent amount of an
antibiotic ointment in its place. AFA adds that more recent information from the American Red Cross suggests that
cool water or wet cloths is the first step in treatment, but that ice is not recommended except for minor burns.


The FAA's Analysis of the Petition


The FAA agrees with industry practice. Serious burns can be properly treated only by professionals in a medical facility.
Neither burn ointment nor cold water is, by itself, an adequate response to a major burn injury. The intent of the burn
ointment requirement has always been to provide relief from minor burns caused by cigarettes or hot beverages.
In the limited situation of treating minor burns aboard an aircraft, cold water is the preferred treatment. This treatment
avoids the heat retentive properties of burn ointment. Moreover, if the wound requires further medical treatment,
the use of ice or cold water eliminates the need to scrape the wound to remove burn ointment.
Therefore, the FAA has determined that burn ointment should be deleted from the list of items required for first aid
kits in parts 121, 125, and 135. Ice or cold water is carried on aircraft operated under part 121 and on aircraft with
20 or more passenger seats operated under parts 125 and 135 to which aircraft the burn ointment requirement applies.
This will spare air carriers the unnecessary expense of having to maintain an unneeded item.


Good Cause Justification


In consideration of the fact that burn ointment is not the preferred treatment for minor burns, the requirement to
carry burn ointment aboard aircraft is inappropriate. Most types of burn ointment have expiration dates, thus new
ointment must be purchased, kits must be opened, the ointment replaced, kit resealed and re-installed, and a record
of the action must be made. The cost of this process, with labor being far more expensive than the ointment itself, represents
a significant nuisance burden for air carriers and commercial operators. ATA carriers are required to maintain over
10,000 kits. This is an unnecessary cost to the industry for which the consumer derives no benefit. It is clearly in
the public interest to delete the requirement.
Since this is a minor amendment in which there is not expected to be any public comment or disagreement from the medical
community, the FAA finds that public notice and comment on this amendment is unnecessary. Moreover, because this
amendment relieves a requirement, it should be made effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register. 

Interested persons, however, are invited to submit such comments as they may desire regarding this amendment. Correspondence
should identify the docket number and be submitted in duplicate to the address provided above. All communications
received on or before the close of the comment period will be considered by the Administrator, and this amendment may
be changed in light of comments received. All comments will be available for public review, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the rules docket.


Trade Impact Statement


The FAA finds that this amendment will have no impact on international trade.


Economic Assessment


Because the amendment imposes no cost to operators, the only impact of this amendment is expected to be that carriers
will experience some cost savings. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that the impact of this amendment is so minimal
that a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted.


Federalism Implications


The regulation adopted herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation would not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of the Federalism Assessment.


Paperwork Reduction


This final rule is expected to produce a minor reduction in the record keeping requirements under parts 121, 125, and
135. The paperwork estimation for those parts will be revised accordingly.

Conclusion




To the extent that this amendment will have an economic effect on the airlines and the general public, it will only be
a minor, positive one. Therefore, the FAA has determined that this amendment involves a regulation that is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Since no small entities would be affected by the rule, the
FAA has determined, and it is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the rule will not
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. The economic
impact is so minimal that it does not warrant a full regulatory evaluation.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 RSPA is granting an extension for the continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312,
MC 331, and MC 338 specifications. The date is extended from April 21, 1994 to August 31, 1995. This extension is based
on comments received from the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, the Heil Co., and members of the Compressed
Gas Association. This final rule allows cargo tank manufacturers additional time to implement engineering 
procedures required for manufacture of cargo tank motor 
vehicles to the new DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications and to implement design modifications as a result of
changes to the structural integrity calculations in the MC 331 and MC 338 specifications.

Public meeting: 

The public meeting will be held at the U.S. Department of Transportation (Meeting room 2230, Nassif Building), 400
Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC, 20590-0001. 


 


<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


RSPA published final rules under Docket Nos. HM-183/HM-183A establishing three new cargo tank specifications
designated as DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 (June 12, 1989, 54 FR 24982; May 22, 1990, 55 FR 21035; September 7, 1990, 55
FR 37028; June 17, 1991, 56 FR 27872). The rules also made changes to 
the structural integrity calculations for the MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks. 
To allow manufacturers sufficient time to implement changes in their manufacturing operations, RSPA provided for
the continued manufacture of cargo tanks to the MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 specifications until August 31, 1993. However,
as manufacturers began implementing the new requirements, certain technical issues were brought to RSPA's attention.
To allow time for resolving these issues, RSPA extended the date that cargo tanks may no longer be constructed to the
MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331 and MC 338 specifications from August 31, 1993 to April 21, 1994 (March 8, 1993, 58 FR 12904).

On March 3, 1993, RSPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend certain requirements for
the manufacture, qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles (March 3, 1993, 58 FR 12316). The NPRM
was in response to petitions for rulemaking received after publication of the final rules. The NPRM addressed certain
technical requirements for the construction of the DOT-400 series specifications and the structural integrity
calculations in the MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. The comment period for the NPRM closed on June 15, 1993. 
A public meeting to address issues raised in the NPRM was held in Chicago on March 24 and 25, 1993. At the meeting, several
significantly different views of design engineers and cargo tank manufacturers were identified. Additionally,
preliminary results were presented at the public meeting of an advanced structural evaluation (using finite element
analysis) of the MC 331 cargo tank which raised questions in regard to stress levels in areas of concentrated loadings.

In response to the NPRM and to issues raised at the public meeting, commenters requested that RSPA provide a one-year
continuation for construction of cargo tanks to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. The commenters
stated that they need time to finalize their engineering designs, develop written specifications, order raw materials,
and establish new training requirements. Because of the complexity and impact of issues that will be addressed in
the final rule and new concerns raised by the commenters, RSPA is extending the compliance date to August 31, 1995.
However, because industry did not request an extension of the provisions specified in  178.337-6, pertaining
to inspection opening or manhole requirements for certain smaller cargo tanks, RSPA is not extending the April 21,
1994 compliance date specified in that section. 
RSPA is issuing this extension of the compliance date because we view this as a noncontroversial amendment and do not
anticipate any adverse comments. This final rule will be effective March 14, 1994, unless by February 11, 1994, RSPA
receives comments that illustrate that extension of the compliance date is not in the public interest. Upon receipt
of such comments, RSPA will withdraw this final rule before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent
documents. One document will withdraw this final rule and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal
to extend the compliance date and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, RSPA will publish
a document in the 

Federal Register

 confirming that this final rule will be effective on March 14, 1994.

B. Public Meeting 


The process of developing the DOT-400 series cargo tank motor vehicle specifications and of updating the MC
331 and MC 338 cargo tank motor vehicle specifications has extended over more than ten years. During this time, the
process has been conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, with the attendant advantage of
offering ample time for manufacturers and users to comment on proposed changes and to provide alternative means of
achieving enhanced safety of cargo tank motor vehicles in hazardous materials service. Some major issues, however,
remain unresolved. These issues pertain to structural integrity, accident damage protection, use of dual function
pressure relief devices, and ASME certification of low pressure cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturers. Changes
endorsed several years ago are now being questioned by some industry members. In addition, RSPA received several
petitions for rulemaking raising certain issues not previously addressed. 
RSPA will conduct a public meeting, in an effort to resolve these issues. The following issues will be discussed at
the times noted: 


Date: 

February 7, 1994 9 a.m. until 12 p.m. 


MC 331 and MC 338 Specifications 




Structural integrity. 

Several commenters have expressed concern over the application and combination of loadings used to determine the
effective stress at any given point on a cargo tank motor vehicle. Based on industry's experience in design, operation,
maintenance and repair of high pressure cargo tank motor vehicles, RSPA solicits information on loading combinations
that may be encountered during the operation of these tanks. 



Date: 

February 7, 1994, 1 p.m. until 5 p.m. and February 8, 1994, 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. 


DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 Specifications 


1. 

Structural integrity. 

Several commenters have expressed concern over the application and combination of loadings used to determine the
effective stress at any given point on a cargo tank motor vehicle. Based on industry's experience in design, operation,
maintenance and repair of cargo tank motor vehicles, RSPA solicits information on loading combinations that may
be encountered during the operation of these tanks. 
2. 

Accident damage protection. 

Several commenters have stated that it is not possible to meet the prescribed accident damage protection requirements.
RSPA solicits information on alternative means to provide cargo tank motor vehicles with adequate bottom, rollover,
and rear-end protection. 
3. 

Dual function pressure relief devices. 

Several commenters have stated that it is not possible to design dual function pressure relief devices. However,
advertisements in trade magazines indicate that such vents are available. RSPA solicits data on the development
and availability of dual function pressure relief devices. 
4. 

ASME certification of low pressure cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturers. 

The Cargo Tank Manufacturers Association (CTMA) submitted for RSPA's consideration a quality control program for
manufacturers of low pressure DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles as an alternative to requiring each manufacturing
facility to have ASME Certification. Copies of the CTMA proposal are available in RSPA's Docket Unit. RSPA solicits
specific comments on the adequacy of the CTMA proposal; particularly in the areas of manufacturing quality control
and independent inspection. 
Information received at the public meeting and in response to the NPRM will be used in the development of the final rule
under Docket HM-183C. However, RSPA may make certain issues subject to a separate rulemaking action. 


C. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 




Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
This rulemaking is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Although
the June 12, 1989 final rule was significant under the regulatory procedures of the Department of Transportation
(44 FR 11034), this document is not significant because it does not impose additional requirements and has the effect
of extending a compliance date. This rule, in fact, provides regulatory and economic relief in some areas. The original
regulatory evaluation of the final rule was not modified because this final rule does not impose additional requirements
and does not make substantive changes to the final rule. 


Executive Order 12612 


This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612

(``Federalism''). The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act 
contains an express preemption provision (49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)) that preempts State, local, and Indian tribe
requirements on certain covered subjects. Covered subjects are: 
(i) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials; 
(ii) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials; 
(iii) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous materials and requirements
respecting the number, content, and placement of such documents; 
(iv) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
materials; or 
(v) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation
of hazardous materials. 
This final rule concerns the manufacturing requirements for packagings represented as qualified for use in the transportation
of hazardous materials. 
This final rule preempts State, local, or Indian tribe requirements in accordance with the standards set forth above.
The HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(5)) provides that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects
after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the 

Federal Register

 the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date
of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective
date of Federal preemption for these requirements will be 90 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 
Thus, RSPA lacks discretion in this area, and preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
This rule applies to manufacturers of DOT specification cargo tank motor vehicles.

SUMMARY:

 The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'' or ``FTC'') amends its regulations issued under section 4 of the
Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) to require the use of the units of both the customary inch/pound measurement
system and the metric measurement system in the net quantity statement for certain consumer commodities. This action
is being taken to implement 1992 amendments to the FPLA, which require such dual measurement system disclosure.

Statement of Basis and Purpose 

I. Introduction 



In 1967, Congress enacted the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1451 

et seq

.) (FPLA). Congress declared that packages and their labels should be marked to enable consumers to obtain accurate
information as to the quantity of the contents and to facilitate value comparisons. 

To effectuate its policy of providing consumers accurate quantity information on commodity labels, Congress in
the FPLA set out general disclosure requirements and delegated to various agencies, including the FTC, the duty of
promulgating regulations. The FTC in 1968 published regulations that provided detailed guidance to industry on
what to include in statements of identity of products; in the identification of manufacturers, packers, or distributors;
and in declarations of net quantities (33 FR 4718, March 19, 1968; 16 CFR part 500). 

The 1967 FPLA specified that the quantity disclosures be made in the customary American inch/pound system of measurement.
The FTC's implementing regulations thus required use of the inch/pound system of measurement. The FTC regulations,
however, also permitted the use of the metric system of measurement as an additional net quantity disclosure (16 CFR
500.21).

In 1992, Congress amended the FPLA to require that the quantity disclosure on labels of consumer commodities be in
both the SI metric system and the customary inch/pound system of measurement. This amendment is consistent with the
overall policy that the metric system is the preferred system of weights and measures for commerce in the United States
(Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, Public Law 100-418, 15 U.S.C. 205b). Because of the metric amendments
to the FPLA, the FTC has conducted this rulemaking to amend its regulations to reflect the requirement for dual disclosure.


This rulemaking has been conducted pursuant to the Commission Rules prescribing special procedures for the promulgation
and amendment of FPLA regulations. (16 CFR part 1, subpart C.) Pursuant to these procedures, interested parties were
afforded the opportunity to participate in the proceeding through the submission of written data, views, or arguments.
On August 17, 1993, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) in the 

Federal Register

 that sought comment on the proposed dual disclosure amendments to the Commission's FPLA regulations.

1

 The Commission also sought comments on its consideration of certain statutory and regulatory requirements relating
to this rulemaking, such as the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321). In the NPR, the Commission
tentatively concluded that the proposed amendments were not ``major'' rule amendments within the meaning of that
statute; were not rules requiring the ``collection of information'' within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction
Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.); and were in compliance with the metric usage requirements of the Metric Conversion Act (15 U.S.C. 205b). Further,
as part of its ongoing regulatory review of existing and proposed regulations, the Commission sought comment about
the overall costs and benefits of the regulations promulgated under the FPLA. Lastly, the Commission, based upon
information currently available, stated its belief that it is unlikely that the proposed amendments would have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small firms. However, given the uncertainty on the question,
the Commission published an initial regulatory analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603-604)
and requested public comment on the potential costs of the amendments. 





The Commission received 20 timely written comments, which are summarized in part III of this notice. The amendments
that the Commission is adopting today are also discussed in part III. The text of the amendments appears at the end of
this notice.

II. Background 


A. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act 


The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act is designed to prevent the use of unfair or deceptive methods of packaging and labeling
of consumer commodities. The FPLA states that it shall be unlawful for persons to sell or distribute commodities whose
labels do not conform ``to the provisions of this Act and of regulations promulgated under the authority of this Act.''
(15 U.S.C. 1452.) The main requirements of the FPLA are that the label on a package disclose the identity of the commodity;
the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the commodity; and the net quantity of
contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count. (15 U.S.C. 1453.) 


1. Shared Enforcement and Implementation Authority 


In the FPLA, Congress has established a system of divided authority for implementation and enforcement. The authority
to promulgate and enforce regulations with regard to foods, drugs, devices, or cosmetics is vested in the United States
Food and Drug Administration. (15 U.S.C. 1453(a), 15 U.S.C. 1456(a).) With respect to any other consumer commodity,
authority is vested in the FTC (15 U.S.C. 1454(a), 15 U.S.C. 1456(b)). With regard to imports of consumer commodities
into the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury enforces FPLA. (15 U.S.C. 1456(c).) Additionally, several
other agencies have adopted parallel disclosure schemes on their own initiative.

2

 




2. Consumer Commodities 


The FPLA defines consumer commodities as being any food, drug, device, or cosmetic and any other article, product
or commodity of any kind or class which is customarily produced or distributed for sale through retail sales agencies
or instrumentalities for consumption by individuals, or use by individuals for purposes of personal care or in the
performance of services ordinarily rendered within the household, and which usually is consumed or expended in the
course of such consumption or use.

3

 




The FPLA grants the FTC authority to exempt commodities it regulates under the Act.

4

 Acting under this authority, the FTC has exempted the following products from certain FPLA requirements_camera
film; Christmas tree ornaments; replacement bags for vacuum cleaners; chamois; paper table covers; certain cellulose
sponges; candles; and solder. (16 CFR part 501.) 




In a similar vein, the FTC has interpreted the meaning of ``consumer commodity'' as used in FPLA as not including 52
commodities or classes of commodities. These include such items as antifreeze and automotive accessories, garden
tools and hardware, toys, typewriter ribbons, and woodenware. (16 CFR part 503.) 


3. Procedures for Promulgating Regulations Under FPLA 


The FPLA sets out the procedures to be followed by the FTC in promulgating regulations. The FPLA states that regulations
promulgated by the Commission under section 4 or section 5 shall be promulgated, and shall be subject to judicial review,
by proceedings taken in conformity with the provisions of subsections (e), (f), and (g) of section 701 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 371 (e), (f), and (g)) (``FDC Act'').

5

 




The FTC has implemented this statutory requirement to use the rulemaking procedures of section 371 of the FDC Act by
adopting 16 CFR part 1 subpart C, which sets forth the procedures for the promulgation of rules under authority other
than section 18(a)(1)(B) of the FTC Act. 
Subpart C provides that the effective date of any regulations issued under the FPLA shall not be prior to 30 days after
publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


B. Original FTC Regulations Issued Under the FPLA 


In 1968, the FTC issued the original regulations implementing the FPLA. (33 FR 4718, March 19, 1968.) There are twenty-seven
regulations, of which twenty-two relate to the net quantity of contents declaration. Several of the regulations
relate to the measurement system to be used in the net quantity declaration. For example,  500.8 prescribes
the units of weight and measures to be used;   500.9 through 500.14 set out how weight, fluid measure, length,
width, area, and cubic measure should be expressed; and  500.16 states how fractions should be treated. 
Each of the original regulations mandating measurement disclosure requires the use of customary inch/pound units.
This is because Section 4 of the original FPLA (15 U.S.C. 1453) states that required net quantity disclosure be in pounds,
inches, feet, yards, pints, quarts, gallons, etc.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940112-0-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940112-0-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One of the FTC regulations issued under the FPLA allows the optional use of metric units in addition to the mandated
inch/pound units. Section 500.21 (16 CFR 500.21) states: 



A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental
net quantity statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight
or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels. Standard metric abbreviations may be
used. 



Thus, under the original regulations, manufacturers, packers, and distributors of consumer commodities subject
to FTC regulations were required to make net quantity of contents disclosure using inch/pound units but had the option
of making additional disclosure in metric units. 


C. The 1992 Metric Amendments to the FPLA 


In 1992, the FPLA was amended to require that the International System of Units (``SI metric system'') as well as the
customary inch/pound system of measure be used in the label declaration of net quantity of contents of consumer commodities.
(Pub. L. 102-329, August 3, 1992.) It is these statutory changes which the FTC is implementing in adopting the
regulations set out in this notice. 
The 1992 substantive amendments to the FPLA relate to metric. The basic change that the amendments make is that all
labels for consumer commodities printed after February 14, 1994, must state the net quantity of contents in both the
customary inch/pound system of measure and the SI metric system. Apart from the changes made to section 4 (15 U.S.C.
1453), section 5 (15 U.S.C. 1454), and section 13 (15 U.S.C. 1461), the FPLA remains the same. Specifically, the statutory
amendments are as follows. 
Section 4 of FPLA requires that a consumer commodity bear a label which specifies the identity of the commodity, the
name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and the net quantity of contents. The amendments
to Section 4 require that the contents label be in both the customary inch/pound and metric systems of measurement.

Subsection (a)(2) has been amended to mandate the disclosure of contents in terms of mass as well as weight. The original
FPLA only required weight, a unit of the customary system of measure. Mass (measured in kilograms and multiples and
submultiples) is the metric term for the quantity of matter in an object. 
Subsection (a)(2) specifies that the metric disclosure shall use the ``SI metric system.'' The ``SI'' system is the
International System of Units (Le Systeme International d'Unites) as interpreted or modified for use in the United
States by the Secretary of Commerce. (55 FR 52242, Dec. 20, 1990.) There are several government publications giving
guidance on use of the SI.

6

 




Subsection (a)(3)(A)(ii) states that decimal fractions of the pound and decimal fractions of the SI metric system
units shall be carried out to no more than three places on random packages, which are packages with varying weight or
mass from a lot of the same consumer commodity. The original FPLA required that decimal fractions of the pound be carried
out to no more than two places. 
Subsection (a)(6) states that content labels containing SI metric disclosure are not required for foods that are
packaged at the retail store level. This amendment affects FDA, rather than FTC, regulations. 
Section 13 of the amended FPLA states that the effective date for the changes to sections 4 and 5 is February 14, 1994.
However, it also provides that, ``The amendments * * * have no effect on the sale or distribution of
products whose labels have been printed before such effective date.'' Thus, companies with labels on hand that were
printed before the effective date may continue to use the supply until exhausted.

E. Comment Suggestions Beyond Commission's Authority Under FPLA 



Two comments suggested that the Commission amend the regulations issued under the FPLA in ways that are beyond the
Commission's authority and that would conflict with the 1992 metric amendments to the FPLA. Specifically, NCWM suggested
that packages that are ``rational'' metric sizes, e.g., 250 mL, 500 mL, 1,2,3, and 4 liter, not be required to have inch/pound
content declarations;

8

 and Mr. Berke questioned the value of having metric equivalents on consumer packages and objected to the mandatory
use of metric labeling.

9








As discussed above,

10

 the 1992 amendments to section 4(a)(2) of the FPLA provide that the net quantity of contents shall be stated ``using
the most appropriate units of 

both

 the customary inch/pound system * * *  and, * * *  the SI metric system''
(

emphasis supplied

). Thus, Congress has required by statute that both customary inch/pound and SI metric units are to be used for content
disclosure. The Commission cannot issue regulations that contravene the statutory requirement. 





III. Discussion of Rule Amendments Being Adopted 




Each amendment the Commission is adopting today is identified below. The substantive revisions are described in
detail. Minor, self-explanatory changes are merely noted. Comments about a proposed amendment are discussed with
that amendment. If none of the comments addressed a proposed amendment, the Commission adopts the amendment without
discussion.

A. Section 500.2 Terms Defined 



The Commission is making both significant and minor technical changes to this section. The Commission amends subsection
(a) to include a reference to the 1992 statute amending FPLA and subsection (c) to reflect that the Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency rather than the Secretary of Agriculture enforces the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Subsection (d) deletes references to repealed statutes. In addition, throughout
these proposed amendments, a few non-substantive, technical changes have been made. In subsection (h), as in other
proposed amendments, the metric equivalent for an existing inch/pound reference is added. The use of both systems
in the regulations is called for by the FPLA and is consistent with the requirements of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness
Act of 1988 (Public Law 100, 15 U.S.C. 205b). 

Subsection (j) is new and defines the term ``SI metric,'' a term used throughout the proposed amendments to the regulations.
The definition is derived from official Federal Government publications relating to metric terminology.

11

 The definition makes reference to the statutory authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce to interpret and modify
the International System of Units (SI) for the United States. 





Two comments addressed the use of the term ``SI metric'' in the regulations. NIST wrote that it is confusing and redundant:
a) to use the term ``SI metric'' system because it implies that there are metric systems other than the International
System of Units (SI), and b) to use ``SI metric'' to modify a metric unit name.

12

 (An example of the latter would be the reference to ``SI metric kilograms'' in  500.8(d) of the new rules). NIST
recommended using either ``SI'' or ``metric.'' NCWM recommended that ``you consider eliminating use of the terms
`SI metric' in association with the metric units * * * because the terms stand by themselves as metric
units.''

13

 






The Commission has decided not to accept these suggestions. The substantive 1992 amendments to section 4 of the FPLA
repeatedly make reference to ``the SI metric system,'' and the Commission in its amendments is merely adopting the
statutory language. While the comments offer other acceptable means of expressing metric terms, the Commission
believes its amendments must be consistent with the statutory language. The rules do not require that labels use the
term ``SI metric'' or any other name for the measurement system. The rules only require the disclosure of the contents
using the units of the SI metric system and the customary inch/pound system.

Subsection (k) is new and defines the term ``customary inch/pound,'' which is used in the 1992 metric amendments to
section 4(a)(2) of FPLA (15 U.S.C. 1453) and throughout the proposed amendments to the regulations. One comment addressed
this matter. NIST wrote: ``the term `customary inch/pound' should not be used as a compound adjective (e.g., customary
inch/pound system or customary inch/pound statement). Both terms are independent descriptors for the collection
of measurement units we currently use in the United States and their use together is confusing.''

14

 The Commission has decided not to accept this suggestion. Congress in amending the FPLA in 1992 used the term ``the
customary inch/pound system of measure.'' The Commission intends to be consistent with the statutory terminology.






Subsection (l) is new and defines the term ```e' mark.'' This is a certification mark used in the European Community
(EC) to establish that the package is appropriately filled in accordance with EC standards. The term is defined because
the amendments to section 500.6 (Net Quantity of Contents) allow the term to be used in addition to the mandated content
quantity disclosure. Failure to allow the use of the mark could be an impediment to American companies selling in the
EC.

B. Section 500.6 Net Quantity of Contents Declaration, Location 



This section relates to the technical requirements to be followed in the presentation of the declaration of contents.
There are several amendments to subsection (b). First, the words ``or mass'' are added after the word ``weight.''
This addition is made necessary by the metric amendments to section 4(a)(2) of the FPLA, which state that the quantity
of contents shall be ``in terms of weight or mass, measure or numerical count.''

15

 The same addition is made in each of the regulations that refer to weight so that they uniformly read ``weight or mass.''






An example of an improper metric qualifier, i.e., ``giant liter,'' has been added to the existing examples of improper
inch/pound qualifiers. This example should aid in the preparation of labels. Further, the amendment includes a parenthetical
metric size descriptor in addition to the existing inch/pound size reference. 

The amendment to this section allows the use of the ``e'' mark as part of the statement of the net quantity of contents.
Without the change, the ``e'' mark could be considered an improper qualifier and its use violative of the regulations.


The Commission received two comments relating to the use of the ``e'' mark. The Michigan State Department of Agriculture
commented that the use of the ``e'' mark as part of the statement of quantity of contents is appropriate.

16

 NCWM commented on the placement of the ``e'' mark.

17

 The amendment proposed by the Commission reads: 







When used, the ``e'' mark shall be at least 3 millimeters 
(0.118 inches) in height and shall appear immediately 
after the metric portion of the net quantity of 
contents statement.

 


NCWM suggests the following alternative:

 


When used, the ``e'' mark shall be at least 3 millimeters 
in height and shall be placed in the same field of 
vision as the quantity of contents statement. 




NCWM states that the reason for its suggested change is consistency with the law in the European Community and to avoid
having the FTC impose specific placement requirements on the ``e'' mark. 

The Commission agrees that the Commission rules should be flexible enough to allow companies to meet both the Commission
requirements and other reasonable variations, and that specific placement requirements prevent flexibility.
However, the Commission is not persuaded that use of the phrase ``in the same field of vision'' is appropriate. While
this terminology may be a term of art in the European Community, it is doubtful that many American companies, especially
small businesses, would understand its meaning. Accordingly, the amendments refrain from using the phrase ``in
the same field of vision'' and avoid requiring a precise placement of the ``e'' mark, although they permit the use of
the ``e'' mark as part of the statement of the net quantity of contents. The Commission has amended the subject sentence
in Subsection (b) to read: 

When used, the ``e'' mark shall be at least 3 millimeters 
(approx. 1/8 inch) in height.

18

 





C. Section 500.7 Net Quantity of Contents, Method of Expression 



The only change to this section is the addition of ``or mass'' each time the term ``weight'' is used. 



D. Section 500.8 Units of Weight or Mass and Measure 



This section specifies the measurement units which must be used in making the content disclosure statements. The
amendments to this section implement the 1992 metric amendments to FPLA by specifying the SI metric units which must
be used in dual declaration statements. Neither the amendments to the FPLA nor the Commission's regulations require
that the measurement systems be used in a particular order.

19

 Thus, manufacturers have discretion to put SI metric units first or customary inch/pound units first as they so choose.

<TEXT>
 

The examples of disclosures set out in this section and others are intended to assist manufacturers and distributors
in designing labels which comply with the amendments to the regulations. The examples are not mandatory and set out
different options. For instance, in the only reference to fractions of measurement units, the amendments to the FPLA
state that decimal fractions of pounds and metric mass units may be ``carried out to not more than three decimal places.''
(15 U.S.C. 1453) This is a change from the original FPLA, which restricted decimal fractions to two places. The examples
in the Commission's amended regulations use different decimal places to show that the manufacturer or distributor
can choose which to use. As another instance of options presented to manufacturers or distributors, some of the examples
used in the amended regulations state the SI metric measurement first while others put customary inch/pound units
first. 

The high degree of precision used in the examples contained in the proposed amendments generated thirteen comments.

20

 But for one,

21

 the comments uniformly stated that the examples use too precise measurements for commercial purposes. The comments
suggest that in most instances three digits, including both whole number and decimals, should be used while in certain
situations two digits should be allowed. As a result of the comments, the Commission has changed the examples throughout
the regulations to use three and two digits as suggested and has added an amendment to  500.19 (see part III.O.
below) embodying such usage.

22

 







The only description of measurement precision in the 1992 amendments to the FPLA is in section 4(a)(3)(A), which states
that for certain packages decimal fractions may be carried out to no more than three places. Based upon this statutory
language, the illustrative examples used in the proposed amendments contained up to three decimal places. Sometimes
this resulted in examples using as many as six total digits, including whole numbers and decimal places. The comments
generally stated that such precision implies a greater measuring accuracy than is likely to be possible.

23

 The comment from Mr. John Buchanan is illustrative: 






I suggest that the regulatory requirement for net quantity be limited to three significant digits, which would still
be consistent with the FPLA specification but would lead to less cluttered labels, greater truth in labeling by removing
the spurious accuracy, and a more rapid conception of the metric system by consumers. * * * Conversions
such as 1 lb. (453.59 g) look very intimidating to the average citizen. Some of the implied accuracies are bordering
on the ludicrous, for example, in 500.27 you are suggesting that the linear dimensions of facial tissue can be measured
to one-hundredth of a millimetre, which is less than the diameter of a single fiber! Or, in 500.16, where the capacity
of a 6 fl. oz. cup is expressed to an accuracy of one-hundredth of a millilitre_far less than one drop.

24





 



Based upon its consideration of the comments, the Commission has changed the examples used in the final amendments.
The changes require the use of three digits for the quantity declaration (e.g., ``453g (1 lb)'' ( 500.9(a))
except where the quantity is below 100 grams, milliliters, centimeters, square centimeters or cubic centimeters
where the quantity declaration can be shown in two figures (e.g. ``17 in. x 4 in. x 20 in. (43 x 10 x 50
cm)'' (500.16(a)(1)(ii)). These changes bring the amended regulations into conformity with the Uniform Packaging
and Labeling Regulation adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures and the packaging and labeling
regulations of the Canadian Legal Metrology Branch.

25

 





Aside from the above changes, subsection (a) requires the use of grams, milligrams, and kilograms as well as pounds
and ounces in weight or mass declarations. Examples of dual declarations are included. 

Subsection (b) requires the use of liters and milliliters as well as gallons, quarts, and pints in fluid measure disclosure.
The term ``Celsius'' replaces ``Centigrade'' because Centigrade is obsolete for temperature measurement.

Subsection (c) states that meters, centimeters, and millimeters must be used as well as inches in linear measure.


Subsection (d) requires that area measurement use square meters, square decimeters, square centimeters, and square
millimeters as well as square yards, square feet, and square inches. 

Subsection (e) states that dry measure statements shall use liters and milliliters as well as bushels, pecks, dry
quarts, and pints. 

Subsection (f) requires, in cubic measure disclosures, the use of cubic meters, cubic centimeters, and, cubic centimeters
as well as cubic yards, cubic feet, and cubic inches. 



E. Section 500.9 Units of Weight and Mass, How Expressed 



The Commission amends this section to include the requirement for the use of mass as well as weight and continues to
describe the appropriate customary inch/pound units to be used on packages of various weights. 

Subsection (a) includes the ``net mass'' disclosure and has several metric examples added. The amended subsection
allows the term ``net mass'' as an alternative to ``net weight'' in stating the net quantity of contents. 

The comments state that the requirement to use the terms ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' is unnecessary and ``* * *
creates clutter on a label that is much better left with free space.* * *''

26

 Declaring contents without ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' is ``already the successful practice in Canada'' and has
been adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures.

27

 Further, the proposed Food and Drug Administration regulations for metric labeling of food products under the FPLA
also make the use of ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' optional. 






Based upon the reasoning contained in the ten comments on this issue,

28

 the Commission has determined to make optional the use of the terms ``net weight'' and ``net mass.'' Thus, under the
amendment, a manufacturer or distributor need only state the weight or mass of the contents without using the qualifying
terms ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' (

e.g.

 ``453g (1 lb).'' However, the amendment to subsection (a) makes it clear that even where the terms are not used, the
quantity of contents declaration shall always declare the net quantity of contents.

29

 






Subsection (b)(2) reflects the amendment to the FPLA which deletes the former avoirdupois (the system of weight based
upon the pound of 16 ounces) requirement that packages weighing one pound or more but less than four pounds disclose
both the total number of ounces and the number of pounds, with any remainder in ounces or common or decimal fractions
of the pound. Thus, under the old law, if a package weighed 3 and one-half pounds it would properly be labeled ``56 oz.
(3 lbs. 8 oz.).'' The new law requires only the expression of pounds and remainder of ounces, so that in the prior example
``3 lbs. 8 oz.'' would be sufficient. For weights greater than 1 pound but less than 4 pounds manufacturers will have
the option to include an additional statement of weight in ounces ``immediately adjacent'' to the required expression
in pounds, as subsection (b)(2) has been amended to allow this discretionary second expression of weight. Subsection
(b)(1) retains the requirement that disclosure be given exclusively in ounces for packages containing less than
one pound.

Proposed subsection (b)(3) as it appeared in the NPR retained the current requirement that for weights of 4 pounds
or more disclosure be given exclusively in whole pounds, with any remainder in ounces or fractions of the pound. The
Commission received two comments on this issue, each of which argued that the use of ounces be permitted as an optional
additional disclosure on products weighing 4 pounds or more. Procter & Gamble wrote:

 

We believe manufacturers should be allowed to voluntarily include net contents in units of ounces or fluid ounces
for products containing more than four pounds or more than one gallon. This provision would again promote fair value
comparisons between the largest 1 or 2 sizes of a consumer product such as laundry detergent with the smaller sizes
of the same brand or alternate brands. Comparison between two sizes such as 50 oz (3 lb 2 oz) and 85 oz (5.31 lb) is accomplished
much more easily by comparing ounces. Comparison between two sizes such as 48 fl oz (1 quart 1 pint) and 144 fl oz (1 gallon
1 pint) similarly is accomplished much more easily by comparing fluid ounces. We see important consumer benefits
and no risks in extending voluntary use of ounces or fluid ounces to larger sizes.

30







The National Conference on Weights and Measures similarly urges the Commission to allow the voluntary use of ounces
and fluid ounces to larger size packages. NCWM states: 




The (Laws and Regulations) Committee believes that allowing manufacturers to voluntarily include dual-quantity
declarations would (1) reduce the cost of implementing the metric amendments; (2) facilitate value comparison by
consumers; (3) minimize change for some manufacturers; (4) not increase label clutter.

31








The Commission is persuaded that permitting the voluntary use of ounces on packages of four pounds or more is in the
public interest and has so amended subsection b(3). The Commission believes that allowing the use of ounces on large
size packages will facilitate price comparisons without any negative consequences. 
Subsection (c) states that for random packages, i.e., packages with varying weights from a lot of the same commodity,
the decimal fractions of the pound should not be carried out to more than three places. Further, this subsection is
changed to reflect the amendment to FPLA that random packages, unlike other packages, are not required to, but may,
include a metric statement of mass.

F. Section 500.10 Units of Fluid Measure, How Expressed 


This section continues to describe how the inch/pound fluid measure statement must be expressed. Under the amended
FPLA, there is no requirement that the disclosure in fluid ounces be made when the amount is greater than a pint. Accordingly,
subsection (b)(2) deletes the prior requirement that both the total number of fluid ounces and the largest whole unit
(quarts, quarts and pints, or pints) plus remainder be used for items of at least 1 pint but less than 1 gallon. For quantities
of at least 1 pint but less than 1 gallon, manufacturers will have the option to include an additional statement of net
quantity in fluid ounces ``immediately adjacent'' to the required expression of largest whole unit, as proposed
subsection (b)(2) allows this discretionary second expression of fluid measure. Subsection (b)(1) retains the
requirement that disclosure be given exclusively in fluid ounces for quantities less than one pint. 
Proposed subsection (b)(3) as it appeared in the NPR retained the requirement for quantities of one gallon or more
that disclosure be given exclusively in largest whole unit, with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or fractions
of the pint or quart. The Commission received two comments on this subsection arguing in favor of permitting the optional
use of fluid ounces for products above one gallon.

32

 For the reasons discussed in part III.E. above, the Commission has determined that it is in the public interest to permit
the voluntary additional disclosure of fluid ounces for products above one gallon. Subsection (b)(3) has been amended
to reflect the Commission's determination. 




G. Section 500.11 Measurement of Commodity Length, How Expressed



This section describes how to express linear measure in terms of yards, feet, and inches. The amendments reflect the
determination by Congress not to continue to require the disclosure of the total number of inches for items one foot
or more in length. For those items one foot or more in length, disclosure should be made in the largest whole unit with
the remainder in inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot or yard. 


H. Section 500.12 Measurement of Commodities by Length and Width, How Expressed 


This section describes how to express the net quantity for bidimensional commodities which are measured by length
and width, such as roll type goods like foils and tapes. The amendments add metric parentheticals to the inch/pound
statements and examples. 
The Commission amends subsection (a)(1) by deleting the requirement that length and width be expressed in ``linear
inches and fractions thereof.'' This requirement is inconsistent with amendments to subsection 500.8(c), which
provide that ``statements of linear measure shall be in terms of both yards, feet, and inches and SI metric meters,
centimeters, or millimeters.'' Consequently, the Commission amends subsection (a)(1) to read that length and width
are to be expressed ``in linear measure'' and that the ``customary inch/pound statement is to be expressed in inches
and fractions thereof.'' 
Subsection (a)(2) has been made consistent with amended subsection 500.8(d), which provides that ``statements
of measure of area shall be in terms of both square yards, square feet, and square inches and SI metric square meters,
square centimeters, and square millimeters.'' The Commission amends the subsection (a)(2) requirement that disclosure
``be expressed in terms of square inches, followed in parentheses by the length and width in the largest whole unit
(yard or foot),'' to read that net quantity is to ``be expressed in terms of area, followed by length and width'' and
that the ``customary inch/pound statement of area is to be expressed in square inches with length and width expressed
in the largest whole unit (yard or foot).'' 
For the same reasons described above, the Commission modifies two other existing subsections in  500.12. Subsection
(a)(3) is rewritten to reconcile it with amendments to the disclosure provisions of subsection 500.8(d), and subsection
(b) is amended to reconcile it with the linear measure disclosure provisions of subsection 500.8(c). 


I. Section 500.13 Measurement of Commodities by Area Measure Only, How Expressed 


This section describes how to express the net quantity in the inch/pound system for commodities that are measured
in area only. The amendments add metric parentheticals to the inch/pound statements. The amendments reflect the
determination by Congress not to continue to require the disclosure of square inches for areas one square foot or greater.



J. Section 500.14 Statements of Cubic Measure and Dry Measure 


The amendment to this section deletes a superfluous reference to dual declarations of net quantity of contents. 


K. Section 500.15 Units of Count, More Than One Ply 



The amendment to this section includes metric in the example.

L. Section 500.16 Measurement of Container Type Commodities, How Expressed 


Formerly  500.15a, the Commission renumbers this section and adds metric parentheticals to the inch/pound
statements and examples. 
Further, subsections 500.16(b)(1) and (b)(2) are brought into conformity with other sections of the amendments
by specifying the customary inch/pound units of liquid and dry measurement which should be used. 


M. Section 500.17 Fractions 


Formerly  500.16, the Commission renumbers this section and adds the requirement that SI metric declarations
contain only decimal fractions. This prohibition against using common fractions with metric units is consistent
with staff interpretations dating from 1984 and with proper metric usage. In accordance with the amendments to FPLA,
the amendment to this section states that decimal fractions shall not be carried out to more than three decimal places,
rather than the previous two decimal places. 


N. Section 500.18 SI Metric Prefixes 


This is a new section and presents the metric prefixes to be used on labels. Unlike scientific metric prefix charts
which have prefixes for huge amounts, e.g. ``exa-'' for units with eighteen trailing digits (1,000,000,000,000,000,000)
and for minuscule amounts, e.g. ``atto-'' for units with eighteen preceding digits (.000 000 000 000 000 000 1), the
chart is restricted to prefixes usable in the size range of consumer commodities. The chart contained in the proposed
regulation referred to ``kilo-'', ``hecto-'', ``deca-'', ``deci-'', ``centi-'', and ``milli-''. However, based
on comments received, the Commission is adding the prefix ``micro-'' and its appropriate symbol, the Greek letter
``mu'' ( u ) and deleting the ``hecto-.'' As stated by one commenter, the micrometer ``* * * is used
for thickness of plastic and other material thicknesses * * *.''

33

 Since the Commission's FPLA regulations govern products such as garbage bags, foil and other household wrapping
products the Commission has determined that it is appropriate to add the prefix for the SI metric unit used to describe
their thickness. The comments stated that the prefix ``hecto'' was not used on consumer products.

34

 





O. Section 500.19 Conversion of SI Metric Quantities to Inch/Pound and Inch/Pound Quantities to SI metric
Quantities 


This is a new section. Subsection (a) sets out the 
conversion factors for converting from metric to inch/pound and from inch/pound to metric quantities. The chart
facilitates compliance with the 1992 amendments to the FPLA requiring dual inch/pound and metric disclosure by giving
manufacturers the technical information they need to convert one measurement system to the other. The factors used
in this chart are consistent with those published in the ``Guide for the Use of the International System of Units,''
NIST Special Publication 811, Department of Commerce, September, 1991, and ``Preferred Metric Units For General
Use by the Federal Government,'' Federal Standard 376B, General Services Administration, January 27, 1993. Because
many of the products governed by the Commission's regulations issued under the FPLA are measured in the customary
inch/pound unit ``mil'' (1/1000 of an inch), the Commission has added a factor for converting mils into the SI metric
unit micrometer. 
Subsection (b), relating to the number of digits to be used in making the required content disclosures, was not in the
proposed regulation but has been added as the result of the comments received. As discussed in section III.D. above,
the issue of the degree of precision needed in making the disclosures generated 12 comments

35

, 11 of which argued for avoiding unneeded degrees of accuracy. Based on the logic contained in the comments, the Commission
has determined that for most declarations of content the use of three significant digits will suffice to give consumers
adequate information. In certain situations, i.e., where the quantity involved is below 100 grams, milliliters,
centimeters, square centimeters or cubic centimeters, the manufacturer or distributor has the option of using two
digits. The prescribed use of three and two digits is consistent with the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Act adopted
by the National Conference on Weights and Measures and the packaging and labeling regulations of the Canadian Legal
Metrology Branch.

36

 





P. Section 500.20 Conspicuousness 


Formerly  500.17, the Commission renumbers this section. 


Q. Section 500.21 Type Size in Relationship to the Area of the Principal Display Panel 


Formerly  500.18, the Commission renumbers this section and amends it to add metric parentheticals. Subsection
(g) is new and relates to the size requirements of the ```e' mark.''

37

Four comments raised the issue of letter and print size requirements when the metric symbols, especially the ``mL''
symbol, are used.
 The comments express concern that the requirement for lower case type for metric symbols may increase the height requirements
for net content declarations in instances where other provisions in  500.21 impose minimum type sizes on lower
case letters.
 As a result, the commenters believe that the size of the area taken up by the net contents declaration would increase.
To alleviate this result, the commenters propose amendments to  500.21. 





First Brands Corporation suggests that ``* * * the minimum height requirement for the `m' in the abbreviation
`mL' for milliliter be no less than one-half of the minimum height standards prescribed in * * *'' other
parts of  500.21.
 




The NCWM offers the following proposal for consideration: 




Add a new paragraph to  500.21_(h) When upper and lower case, or all lowercase letters are used in SI (metric)
symbols, it is the uppercase ``L,'' lowercase ``d,'' or their equivalent in the print or type used that shall meet the
minimum height requirement. Other letters and exponents must be presented in the same type style and in proportion
to the type size used. However, no letter shall be less than 1.6mm (1/16 inch) in height.
 






Mr. Stempnik suggests that the following sentence be added: 




The height of the SI declaration shall be equal or greater than the inch pound declaration height.
 






Borden suggests that ``when upper and lower case letters are used, it is the upper case letter `o' or its equivalent
that shall meet the minimum height standards.''






Based upon the comments, the Commission believes that it is necessary to address the issue of type size changes resulting
from the metric amendments to the FPLA. The Commission adopts the proposal made by the National Conference on Weights
and Measures because it presents a standard which is precise, yet not complex or burdensome for industry to follow.
Establishing minimum height and size requirements for type and print of letters should assure adequate disclosure
to consumers without burdening industry by necessitating an increase in the minimum height for the content declaration.
Therefore, the Commission amends section 500.21 by adding a subpart (h) setting out these requirements. 


R. Section 500.22 Abbreviations 


Formerly  500.19, the Commission renumbers this section. 


S. Section 500.23 Expression of Net Quantity of Contents in SI Metric Units 


This is a new section. Subsection (a) sets out the ``rule of 1000'' which states that, with exceptions, metric disclosure
should be in units ranging in value from 1 to 1000. Thus, the declaration would be ``750 mL'' rather than ``0.75L.''
The ``rule of 1000'' has been used by industry and FTC staff since 1984 and has the effect of simplifying and unifying
label disclosure. 
Subsection (b) sets out the symbols to be used for SI metric units. These symbols are consistent with those preferred
for government usage.

Based on the eight comments received,

45

 the Commission has added the lowercase ``l'' as an alternative to the uppercase ``L'' as the symbol for the SI metric
liter and milliliter. The comments point out that while the uppercase ``L'' is the preferred symbol, there is no international
agreement on requiring only the uppercase ``L.'' Indeed, international law may require permitting the use of the
lowercase ``l.'' As Mr. John H. Woelflein commented:




Because the BIPM SI brochure as well as ISO 1000 give the symbol for liter as ``l,L'', the US is obligated as a Meter Convention
signatory to permit the use of either symbol. Otherwise, imported products which use the lower case ``l'' could be
excluded by Customs authorities. Of course, the capital ``L'' is preferred for USA use.

46






Further, companies that export products often prefer to use the lowercase ``l'' ``as being more acceptable in some
countries.''

47






Section 500.24 Supplemental Statements 

Section 500.25 Net Quantity, Average Quantity, Permitted Variations 

Section 500.26 Representations of Servings, Uses, Applications 

Section 500.27 Multiunit Packages 

Section 500.28 Variety Packages 

Section 500.29 Combination Packages.

 


The amendments to these six sections renumber them, add metric examples and parentheticals, and make reference to
``mass'' as well as weight where appropriate. In the amendment to  500.26 the reference to the National Bureau
of Standards has been changed to read ``National Institute of Standards and Technology.'' 



IV. Other Statutory and Regulatory Considerations 



In promulgating the amendments to the FPLA regulations, the Commission has considered certain statutory and regulatory
requirements. These requirements arise under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321); the
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501); the Metric Conversion Act (15 U.S.C. 205b); the Commission's Regulatory
Review Program; and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603).



 A. National Environmental Policy Act 



Under the Commission's rules (16 CFR subpart I, section 1.81 

et seq.

) implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321), no ``major'' rule amendment ``significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment'' will be proposed unless an environmental assessment or impact statement
has been prepared (16 CFR 1.82). For the following reasons, it is not appropriate to have an environmental assessment
or statement for the amendments to regulations issued implementing the metric amendments to FPLA. 

First, the amendments do not ``significantly affect the quality of the human environment'' because they do not independently
create significant new duties. Moreover, any environmental consequences that may come from metric measurement
translation and disclosure are not the result of the amendments to the regulations, but instead are consequences
of the amendments to FPLA by Congress. Second, the environmental effects, if any, of the amendments are so uncertain
that any environmental analysis would be based on speculation. (See, 16 CFR 1.83(a).) Third, under section 13 of the
amended FPLA, labels printed prior to February 14, 1994 may continue to be used until the supply is exhausted. Thus,
companies will not have to discard unused labels into the waste stream and, by so doing, cause damage to the environment.
Therefore, the amendments to the FPLA regulations are unlikely to cause any significant impact on the environment.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Commission, before promulgating a rule that requires the ``collection of information,'' must obtain approval
from the Office of Management and Budget. The amendments only require that certain information be disclosed to consumers.
In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the authority of the Office of Management and Budget to approve ``collection
of information'' by Federal agencies does not include authority to review agency rules requiring companies to disclose
information to third parties. 

Dole 

v. 

Steelworkers,

 494 U.S. 26, 35 (1990). Under this case, the metric labeling requirements would not be considered collection of information.
Thus, the Commission need not seek approval from the Office of Management and Budget. 




C. The Metric Conversion Act 



Section 205b of the Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, expresses Congressional
policy regarding measurement systems. This Act states that the metric measurement system is the preferred system
of weights and measures in the United States. It also requires federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement
in all procurement, grants, and other business-related activities (which include rulemakings), except to the extent
that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms.


The amendments adopted today by the Commission fully comply with the requirements of the Metric Conversion Act. Each
of the amended regulations providing for quantity disclosure requires a statement of net quantity of contents in
metric units as well as in customary inch/pound units. The amendments add metric examples and parenthetical metric
equivalents to the existing regulations. Further, the amendments explicitly present conversion factors from inch/pound
to metric and vice versa and fully describe metric units and prefixes. 



D. The Commission's Regulatory Review Program 



As part of the Commission's ten-year regulatory-review plan for existing rules and guides, the Commission specifically
sought comments in the NPR on the costs and benefits of the existing and amended regulations under the FPLA and their
regulatory and economic impact. There were two comments that related to the economic impact on small business of the
metric amendments.
 There were no comments relating to the economic impact of the regulations on larger businesses.

Cramer Products stated a concern not with the intent or scope of the regulations, but with the proposed timetable for
compliance. Cramer contends that there would be an average cost of $200 to change the labels for each of the 500 products
it sells for a total of $100,000.

49

 To alleviate these costs, Cramer proposes changing the effective date from February 14, 1994 to February 14, 1996.
This extension of time would ``allow companies like Cramer to more gradually phase-in the changes, spreading the
cost and personnel requirements over the next 2 years.''

50

 





Congresswoman Meyers, while not supplying any compliance cost data, also stated a concern that small businesses
be given adequate time within which to come into compliance. While acknowledging that the amendments to the FPLA allow
any supply of labels printed before February 14, 1994 to be used until exhausted, she states ``the fact remains that
most small businesses don't have the resources to stockpile labels like big enterprises do.''

51

 




A decision by the Commission to adopt a later effective date for its rules would not grant significant relief to small
businesses. By terms of the FPLA statute, all businesses must conform to the new dual disclosure requirements therein
by February 14, 1994, whatever the effective date of the Commission's implementing rules. Thus, businesses would
have to incur the cost of label changes in any event once their existing supply runs out. 
The Commission shares the commenters' concern that there be no undue hardship on businesses that are required to make
the transition to the dual disclosures specified in these rules. However, the comments do not provide factual data
quantifying such costs sufficient for the Commission to conclude that there is a significant economic impact on small
businesses as a class.

52

 




Furthermore, while section 5(b) of the FPLA permits the Commission to grant exemptions from statutory requirements
where it is demonstrated that compliance with the new requirements of section 4 is impracticable or not necessary
for adequate protection of consumers, such exemptions are intended to be granted only in exceptional circumstances.
(138 Congressional Record H5345 (daily ed. June 29, 1992).) The rulemaking record in this matter does not allow the
Commission to conclude that exceptional circumstances exist for small firms that would make compliance with the
requirements of the amendments adopted today impracticable or unnecessary adequately to protect consumers. 
As discussed in Part II above, the amended regulations issued today as well as the unamended regulations which continue
in effect are mandated by the FPLA. While there are costs associated with compliance, the Commission has designed
the regulations to minimize the economic burden on businesses, both large and small.

53

 




E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This Statement of Basis and Purpose contains a final regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 603-604. A final regulatory flexibility analysis must be conducted unless the head of the agency
``certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.'' (5 U.S.C. 605(b).) Based upon information in the public record, the Commission believes that it
is unlikely that the amendments being adopted today will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small firms. However, given the existing uncertainty on this question, the Commission has decided to publish this
final regulatory analysis. 
The Commission complied with the requirements of section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act by including in the
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (58 FR 43726, August 17, 1993) certain information for the initial regulatory flexibility
analysis. Specifically, the Commission explained that the reasons for the amendments and their objective are to
implement the explicit directives of Congress in the FPLA. Similarly, the Commission stated that the legal basis
is provided by the FPLA. (5 U.S.C. 603(b)(1)-(2).) Further, the Commission explained that there are no recordkeeping
or reporting requirements in the amendments, and that the compliance requirements are essentially measurement
and labeling tasks described. (5 U.S.C. 603(b)(4).) The Commission stated that there also are no relevant Federal
rules which may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rules, inasmuch as the Commission, the FDA, and
other agencies with authority to implement the FPLA are given exclusive jurisdiction over various classes of consumer
commodities. (5 U.S.C. 603(b)(5).) The Commission specifically requested comments on whether the amendments may
have a significant impact on small business.

The Commission received one comment specifically responding to the request for information on the Regulatory Flexibility
Act
 and two comments that otherwise included certain economic material relating to small business costs of compliance.
 






Mr. Stempnik responded to the regulatory flexibility questions by stating: 





Exclusions should be only what is required by the revised FPLA and no more. * * * I do not support exemptions
because labels are changed frequently for marketing reasons and companies can stockpile unlimited quantities of
old labels before the deadline and continue to use them until they are used up.
 







Cramer Products commented, without substantiating information, that there would be an average cost per product
of $200 to change its labels to bring them into compliance, and Congresswoman Meyers was concerned that the deadline
for compliance of February 14, 1994 would cause harm to small business.
 





The amended regulations that the Commission adopts today cover every company in the economy that produces consumer
commodities other than those commodities falling within the authority of other agencies or otherwise exempted from
the statute's coverage. Based on the information now available on the public record, it is not feasible for the Commission
to estimate the number of entities within this class of industry that also are small companies within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (5 U.S.C. 601(3).) Nevertheless, the information in hand suggests that the overall
economic impact of the metric amendments to the regulations issued under FPLA may not be significant. In essence,
all the amendments require is that companies make simple mathematical conversions from the inch/pound measurement
system into the metric measurement system and include the metric equivalents on already mandated label disclosure
of contents of consumer commodities.
 The FPLA states that non-complying labels printed prior to February 14, 1994 may continue to be used until the supply
is exhausted.

Similarly, the direct costs imposed on consumers as a result of the amendments appear to be minimal since consumers
will still obtain disclosures in the customary inch/pound system. There are, however, likely to be some indirect
costs associated with the amendments as firms incur costs associated with complying with the amendments. There are
basically three types of costs that firms incur as a result of labeling regulations. These costs are inventory disposal
costs, administrative costs, and printing costs. Inventory disposal costs consist of the value of inventory that
must be disposed of in order to comply with the proposed regulation. These costs will be zero since the amendments do
not apply to labels that were printed before the effective date of the regulation. 

Administrative costs represent the additional costs incurred at an administrative level in order to comply with
the regulation. Administrative costs include determining which products fall within the scope of the regulation;
establishing a corporate position on the policy; devising a compliance strategy; and overseeing the compliance
strategy. These costs are likely to be relatively low for the proposed change to the FPLA. Most products that are already
covered by the FPLA will be subject to the amendments adopted today and the amendments appear to clearly state what
products would be excluded. In addition, firms would not need to undertake potentially costly analytic or market
testing to comply with the changes. Thus, it appears that administrative costs per firm would be low. 

Printing costs consist of the additional printing costs incurred due to the changes in the regulations adopted today.
These costs will vary among firms depending on various factors including, but not necessarily limited to the following:
(1) How frequently the firm typically changes its label; (2) the average inventory of labels; and (3) the printing
process utilized by the firm. For example, if the firm updates its labels on a yearly basis, it may delay its normal label
update to coincide with changes it will have to make in response to the changes in the FPLA. If so, the additional printing
costs caused by the change would be minimal. If, however, the firm normally updates its labels only once every ten years
and if it has recently updated its labels, then its costs will be higher. 

Incremental printing costs will also depend, to some extent, on the average inventory. The greater the time period
between reordering labels, the more likely it is that the label change due to the regulation can be planned to coincide
with a planned label change, all else being equal. The type of printing process utilized by the firm also affects the
incremental printing costs. While firms may be able to simply engrave the new information on existing plates if flexography
or lithography printing methods are used and space permits, new cylinders would be required if gravure printing is
utilized. 

Given the relative simplicity of the label change required by the proposed amendment, the fact that many firms already
disclose information in metric, and the fact that many firms are likely to have been aware since late 1992 that the amendments
were scheduled to take effect on February 14, 1994, printing costs per firm associated with the amendments are likely
to be low. Thus, the amendments adopted today, may not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act sets out three subjects which must be addressed in the final regulatory
flexibility analysis. Section 605 of the Act (Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis) states that the
analysis required by section 604 may be done in conjunction with other analysis. 

A succinct statement of the need for and the objectives of the rule are set out in Part II above. (5 U.S.C. 604(a)(1).)
A summary of the issues raised by the public comment in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis and
the Commission's assessment thereof are discussed above in this section and in Part IV.D., regarding the Commission's
Regulatory Review Program. (5 U.S.C. 604(a)(2).) 

There are no significant alternatives to the amended regulations adopted today which will accomplish the stated
objectives of the applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact on small entities. (5 U.S.C.
604(a)(3).) For example, it would be difficult to devise different or simplified labeling requirements for small
entities that would still implement dual disclosure requirements and yet avoid the principal cost to such businesses,


i.e.

, redesigning labels. For the same reason, the use of general performance standards rather than explicit requirements
likely would not result in substantial cost savings. Moreover, the FPLA is quite specific in directing the use of particular
modes of disclosure in most instances. Further, as discussed in Part III.D. regarding the Commission's Regulatory
Review Program, the amendments adopted today have been designed to minimize the economic impact on small business.

In addition, the Commission has taken further action to reduce any costs of transition for firms which may have been
unaware of the pending metric disclosure requirements of the amended FPLA. As discussed in section V. 

infra, 

the Commission, in order to harmonize with state enforcement policy adopted by NCWM, has stated it will avoid taking
law enforcement action under the new metric amendments to the FPLA rules until November 8, 1994. 


V. Enforcement Policy Statement 


The effective date of these regulations is February 14, 1994. In crafting the FPLA statute, Congress acknowledged
the need for businesses to have time within which to learn about the existence of the requirements to use metric measurement
and to come into compliance. Section 13 of the FPLA states that the metric amendments ``shall have no effect on the sale
or distribution of products whose labels have been printed before'' February 14, 1994. (15 U.S.C. 1451(13).) 
The Commission expects that the states, as in the past, will adopt uniform state laws that mirror the Commission's
new FPLA metric requirements. The National Conference on Weights and Measures,

60

 which represents state enforcers of such laws, already has adopted an enforcement policy designed to avoid undue
hardship to those firms who may have been unaware of the pending metric requirements. In its ``Resolution on Enforcement
of SI Metric Labeling Requirements,'' NCWM has stated that it is advisable ``to allow ample time for industry to become
aware of the metric labeling requirements, and to reduce the burden on industry and thus reduce the cost of updating
of package labels.''

61

 To achieve these goals, the National Conference has resolved to enforce its metric labeling requirements until November
8, 1994 by sending to non-complying businesses letters which state ``not only the area of noncompliance, but also
the correct way to be in compliance.''

62

 






Commission law enforcement actions during this period against non-complying firms could undercut the objectives
stated in the NCWM resolution. While states enforce independent laws, these laws for the most part mirror the Commission's
FPLA rules. Thus, fear of enforcement by the Commission of the federal version of the new state metric requirements
could lead some firms immediately to incur costs of re-labeling, despite assurances of no state law enforcement actions.
In the interest of promoting harmonization with state enforcement, the Commission therefore has determined to avoid
taking law enforcement actions against companies not in compliance with the metric amendments to the final FPLA regulations
until November 8, 1994.

 500.1 

Scope of the regulations of this part. 


The regulations in this part establish requirements for labeling of consumer commodities as hereinafter defined
with respect to identity of the commodity; the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor;
the net quantity of contents; and net quantity of servings, uses, or applications represented to be present. 


 500.2 

Terms defined. 


As used in this part, unless the context otherwise specifically requires: 
(a) The term 

Act 

means the ``Fair Packaging and Labeling Act'' (Pub. L. 89-755, approved Nov. 3, 1966; 80 Stat. 1296 

et seq.

; 15 U.S.C. 1451 

et seq

., as amended by Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992). 
(b) The term 

regulation 

or 

regulations 

means regulations promulgated by the Commission pursuant to sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1453, 1454, 1455).

(c) The term 

consumer commodity 

or 

commodity 

means any article, product, or commodity of any kind or class which is customarily produced or distributed for sale
through retail sales agencies or instrumentalities for consumption by individuals, or use by individuals for purposes
of personal care or in the performance of services ordinarily rendered within the household, and which usually is
consumed or expended in the course of such consumption or use. For purposes of the regulations in this part the term


consumer commodity 

does not include any food, drug, device or cosmetic as defined by section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 321); any meat or meat product, poultry or poultry product, or tobacco or tobacco product; any commodity
subject to packaging or labeling requirements imposed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 

et seq

.); any commodity subject to the provisions of the eighth paragraph under the heading ``Bureau of Animal Industry''
of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151-157); any beverage subject to or complying with packaging or labeling
requirements imposed under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 201 

et seq

.); any commodity subject to the provisions of the Federal Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1551-1610). 
(d) The term 

package 

means any container or wrapping in which any consumer commodity is enclosed for use in the delivery or display of that
commodity to retail purchasers. For purposes of the regulations in this part the term 

package 

does not include shipping containers or wrappings used solely for the transportation of any consumer commodity in
bulk or in quantity to manufacturers, packers, or processors, or to wholesale or retail distributors thereof unless
used in retail display; shipping containers or outer wrappings used by retailers to ship or deliver any commodity
to retail customers if such containers and wrappings bear no printed matter pertaining to any particular commodity;
or containers subject to the provisions of the Act of August 3, 1912 (37 Stat. 250, as amended; 15 U.S.C. 231-233),
the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1186, as amended; 15 U.S.C. 234-236); or transparent wrappers or containers
which do not bear written, printed, or graphic matter obscuring any part of the label information required by this
part. 
(e) The term 

label 

means any written, printed, or graphic matter affixed to or appearing upon any consumer commodity or affixed to or
appearing upon a package containing any consumer commodity; except that: 
(1) An inspector's tag or other nonpromotional matter affixed to or appearing upon a consumer commodity shall not
be deemed to be a label requiring the repetition of label information required by this part, and 
(2) For the purposes of the regulations in this part the term 

label 

does not include written, printed, or graphic matter affixed to or appearing upon commodities, or affixed to or appearing
upon containers or wrappers for commodities sold or distributed to industrial or institutional users. 
(f) The term 

person 

includes any firm, corporation or associations. 
(g) The term 

commerce 

means: 
(1) Commerce between any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or 
possession of the United States, and any place outside thereof, and 
(2) Commerce within the District of Columbia or within any territory or possession of the United States, not organized
with a legislature, but shall not include exports to foreign countries.

(h) The term 

principal display panel 

means that part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal and customary
conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel must be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory
label information required to be placed thereon by this part without obscuring designs, vignettes, or crowding.
This definition does not preclude utilization of alternate principal display panels on a label of a package, but alternate
principal display panels must duplicate the information required to be placed on the principal display panel by this
part. This definition does not preclude utilization of the container closure as the surface bearing the principal
display panel if that label location is the one most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal
and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel of a label appearing on a cylindrical
surface is that 40 percent of the circumference which is more likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined
under normal and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel of a consumer commodity
marketed in a decorative type container, or a container having a capacity of 1/4 ounce (7.4 mL) or less, may be considered
to be a tear-away tag or tape affixed to the container and bearing the mandatory label information as required by this
part, but the type size of the net quantity of contents statement shall be governed by the dimensions of the container
itself. The principal display panel of a consumer commodity marketed on a display card to which the immediate container
of the commodity is affixed may be considered to be the display panel of the card, and the type size of the net quantity
of contents statement is governed by the dimensions of the display card. 
(i) The term 

random package 

means a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying
weights, that is, packages with no fixed weight pattern. 
(j) The term 

SI metric 

refers to units belonging to the International System of Units (abbreviated ``SI'' from the French, 

Le Systeme International d'Unites

), as interpreted or modified for use in the United States by the Secretary of Commerce. They include the SI units (together
with their multiples and submultiples) as well as other metric units (e.g., the liter) that are accepted for use with
the SI units because of their practical importance. 
(k) The term 

customary inch/pound 

refers to units belonging to the system of units used in the United States based on or derived from the ounce, pound,
and ton for weight; the inch, foot, yard, and mile for length; the fluid ounce, pint, quart, and gallon for volume; and
dry pint, dry quart, peck, and bushel for dry measure. 
(l) The term 

``e'' mark 

refers to the symbol ``e'' used in connection with the quantity declarations on labels of some consumer commodities
marketed primarily in the European Community (EC). The ``e'' mark constitutes a representation by the packer or importer
that the package to which it is applied has been filled in accordance with the average system of quantity specified
by the EC. The average system is a method of declaring package fill in the EC and other countries of the world, including
the United States. 


 500.3 

Prohibited acts, coverage, general labeling requirements, exemption procedures. 


(a) No person engaged in the packaging or labeling of any consumer commodity for distribution in commerce, and no person
(other than a common carrier for hire, or a freight forwarder for hire) engaged in the distribution in commerce of any
packaged or labeled consumer commodity, shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any such commodity
if such commodity is contained in a package, or if there is affixed to that commodity a label, which does not conform
to the provisions of the Act and of the regulations in this part. 
(b) Persons engaged in business as wholesale or retail distributors of consumer commodities shall be subject to the
Act and the regulations in this part to the extent that such persons are engaged in the packaging or labeling of consumer
commodities, or prescribe or specify by any means the manner in which such consumer commodities are packaged or labeled.

(c) Each packaged or labeled consumer commodity, unless it has been exempted through proceedings under section 5(b)
of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1454(b)), shall, upon being prepared for distribution in commerce or for sale at retail, and before
being distributed in commerce or offered for sale at retail, be labeled in accordance with the requirements of the
Act and the regulations in this part. 
(d) Each packaged or labeled consumer commodity, unless it has been exempted through proceedings under section 5(b)
of the Act, shall bear a label specifying the identity of the commodity; the name and place of business of the manufacturer,
packer, or distributor; the net quantity of contents; and the net quantity per serving, use or application, where
there is a label representation as to the number of servings, uses, or applications obtainable from the commodity.

(e) Regulations will be promulgated by the Commission exempting particular consumer commodities from one or more
of the requirements of section 4 of the Act and the regulations thereunder to the extent and under such conditions as
are consistent with the declared policy of the Act whenever the Commission finds that, because of the nature, form,
or quantity of the particular consumer commodity, or for other good and sufficient reasons, full compliance with
all the requirements otherwise applicable is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of consumers.
Proceedings for the promulgation of such exempting regulations may be commenced by the Commission upon its own initiative
or pursuant to petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person or group stating reasonable grounds for
the proposed exemption, pursuant to Section 1.15 of this chapter of the Commission's general procedures.

 500.4 

Statement of identity. 



(a) The principal display panel of a consumer commodity shall bear a specification of the identity of the commodity.


(b) Such specification of identity shall comprise a principal feature of the principal display panel, shall be in
such type size and so positioned as to render it easily read and understood by the consumer, and shall be in lines generally
parallel to the base on which the package or commodity rests as it is designed to be displayed. 

(c) Such specification of identity shall be in terms of: 

(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or in the absence
thereof, 

(2) The common or usual name of the commodity; or in the absence thereof, 

(3) The generic name or in other appropriately descriptive terms such as a specification which includes a statement
of function. 

(d) The specification of identity shall not be false, misleading, or deceptive in any respect. Ingredients or components
which are not present in the commodity in a substantial or significantly effective amount may not be mentioned in the
specification of identity; except that a component present in a formulation in substantial and effective amounts,
but not present in the final product due to conversion or transformation into a different entity (which different
entity is present in the final product), may be mentioned in the specification of identity. 



 500.5 

Name and place of business of manufacturer, packer or distributor. 



(a) The label of a consumer commodity shall specify conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer,
packer, or distributor. Where the consumer commodity is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label,
the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such commodity; such as ``Manufactured
for 

XXX

,'' ``Distributed by 

XXX

,'' or any other wording that expresses the facts. 

(b) The requirement for declaration of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall in the case of a corporation
be deemed to be satisfied only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular
division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business
is conducted shall be used. 

(c) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, State, and Zip Code; however, the
street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory.


(d) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a consumer commodity at a place other than his principal place
of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such consumer commodity
was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading. 

(e) Standard abbreviations may be used in complying with the requirements of this section. 



 500.6 

Net quantity of contents declaration, location. 



(a) The label of a consumer commodity shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents separately and accurately
stated on the principal display panel. 

(b) The declaration of net quantity shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated
(by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information
appearing above or below the declaration and, shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight or mass, measure,
or count such as ``jumbo quart,'' ``giant liter,'' ``full gallon,'' ``when packed,'' ``minimum,'' or words of similar
import. The declaration of net quantity shall be separated (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter
``N'' of the style of type used in the net quantity statement) from other printed label information appearing to the
left or right of the declaration. However, the ``e'' mark shall not be considered to be a qualifying word or phrase and
may be used as part of the statement of the net quantity of contents where warranted. When used, the ``e'' mark shall
be at least 3 millimeters (approximately 1/8 in) in height. The declaration of net quantity of contents shall be placed
on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel
to the base on which the package or commodity rests as it is designed to be displayed: 

Provided,

 that: 

(1) On consumer commodities having a principal display panel of 5 square inches (32.2 cm

2

) or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when
the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part, and 

(2) The requirements as to separation, location, and type size, specified in this part are waived with respect to variety
and combination packages as defined in this part. 



 500.7 

Net quantity of contents, method of expression. 



The net quantity of contents shall be expressed in terms of weight or mass, measure, numerical count, or a combination
of numerical count and weight or mass, size, or measure so as to give accurate information regarding the net quantity
of contents thereof, and thereby facilitate value comparisons by consumers. The net quantity of contents statement
shall be in terms of fluid measure if the commodity is liquid, or in terms of weight or mass if the commodity is solid,
semi-solid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and
trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight or mass, or a solid, semi-solid, or viscous product by fluid
measure, numerical count, and/or size, or (as in the case of lawn and plant care products) by cubic measure, it may be
used, when such declaration provides sufficient information to facilitate value comparisons by consumers. The
declaration may appear in more than one line of print or type. 



 500.8 

Units of weight or mass and measure. 



(a) Statements of weight or mass shall be in terms of both avoirdupois pound and ounce and SI metric kilograms, grams,
or milligrams. (Examples of avoirdupois/metric declarations: ``Net Wt 15 oz (425 g)'' or ``Net Wt 11/2 lbs (680 g)''
or `` 2.5 oz (70.8 g)''; examples of metric/avoirdupois declarations: ``Net Mass 425 g (15 oz)'' or ``Net Mass 680 g
(11/2 lbs)'' or ``100 g e (3.5 oz).'')

(b) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of both the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid
ounce subdivisions thereof and SI metric liters or milliliters and shall (except in the case of petroleum products,
for which the declaration shall express the volume at 60 
 Fahrenheit (15.6 
 Celsius)) express the volume at 68 
 Fahrenheit (20 
 Celsius). (Examples of gallon/metric declarations: ``Net 12 fl oz (354 mL)'' or ``Net Contents 1 gal (3.78 L)''
or ``8 fl oz (236 mL)''; examples of metric/gallon declarations: ``Net 500 mL (1.05 pt)'' or ``Net Contents 1 L (1.05
qt).'') 

(c) Statements of linear measure shall be in terms of both yards, feet, and inches and SI metric meters, centimeters,
or millimeters. 

(d) Statements of measure of area shall be in terms of both square yards, square feet, and square inches and SI metric
square meters, square decimeters, square centimeters, or square millimeters. 

(e) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of both the U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart,
and dry pint subdivisions thereof and SI metric liters or milliliters. 

(f) Statements of cubic measure shall be in terms of both cubic yard, cubic foot, and cubic inch and SI metric cubic meters,
cubic decimeters, or cubic centimeters. 



 500.9 

Units of weight or mass, how expressed. 



(a) The term ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' may be used in stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight or mass.
However, where the term ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' is not used, the quantity of contents shall always disclose
the net quantity of contents. For example: ``453 g (1 lb)'' or ``Net Wt 1 lb (453 g)'' or ``Net Mass 453 g (1 lb)''. 

(b) With the exception of random packages, the statement of net quantity of contents in terms of avoirdupois weight
shall be expressed as follows: 

(1) If less than 1 pound, in terms of ounces. (Examples: ``Net Weight 12 oz. (340 g)'' or ``Net Mass 340 g (12 oz)''.) 

(2) If at least 1 pound but less than 4 pounds, in whole pounds, with any remainder in ounces or common or decimal fractions
of the pound, except that it shall be optional to include an immediately adjacent additional expression of net quantity
in terms of ounces. 




(

Examples:

 ``Net Wt. 1 lb. 8 oz. (680 g)'' or ``Net Wt. 1.5 lb./24 oz. (680 g)'' or ``24 oz. (11/2 lb.) 680 g''.) 




(3) If 4 pounds or more, in terms of whole pounds, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions
of the pound, except that it shall be optional to include an immediately adjacent additional expression of net quantity
in terms of ounces. (Examples: ``Net Weight 5 pounds 4 ounces (2.38 kg)'' or ``Net Mass 2.38 kg (5 lbs 4 oz)'' or ``Net
Wt. 51/4 lbs. (2.38 kg)'' or ``Net Mass 2.38 kg (51/4 lbs.)'' or ``Net Wt. 5.25 lbs. (2.38 kg) or ``Net Mass 2.38 kg (5.25
lbs)''.) 

(c) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random package it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound,
be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried out to not more than three decimal places.
When the net weight does not exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in terms of decimal fractions
of the pound in lieu of ounces. (Examples: ``Net Wt. 0.75 lb.'' and ``Net Weight 1.05 pounds.'') Such decimal declaration
shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of section 4(a) of the Act if the accurate statement of
net weight is presented prominently and conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package. The net quantity
of contents declaration on a random package is not required to, but may include a statement in terms of the SI metric
system carried out to not more than 3 decimal places.

(d) It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms. (Examples:
``Net Wt. 6 oz.'' vs. ``6 fl. oz.'' or ``Net Contents 6 fl. oz.'') 



 500.10 

Units of fluid measure, how expressed. 



(a) Use of the terms ``net'' or ``net contents'' is optional. 

(b) Declaration of net quantity of contents in terms of fluid measure shall be identified as such in each instance and
the statement of U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof shall be expressed
as follows: 

(1) If less than 1 pint, in terms of fluid ounces. (Example: ``Net Contents 8 fl. oz. (236 mL)'' or ``Net Contents 236
mL (8 fl. oz.)''.) 

(2) If at least 1 pint but less than 1 gallon, in terms of the largest whole unit (quarts, quarts and pints or pints, as
appropriate), with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart, except
that it shall be optional to include an immediately adjacent additional expression of net quantity in terms of fluid
ounces. (Examples: ``1 qt. (946 mL)'' or ``Net contents 1 qt. 1 pt. 8 oz./56 fl. oz. (1.65 L)'', but not in terms of quart
and ounce such as ``1 quart 24 ounces (1.65 L)''.) 

(3) If 1 gallon or more, in terms of the largest whole unit (gallons followed by common or decimal fractions of a gallon
or by the next smaller whole unit or units viz, quarts and pints) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common
or decimal fractions of the pint or quart, except that it shall be optional to include an immediately adjacent additional
expression of net quantity in terms of fluid ounces. 





(

Examples: 

``Net contents 21/2 gal. (9.46 L)'', ``Contents 2.5 gal. (9.46 L)'', or ``Net contents 2 gallons 2 quarts (9.46 L)''
but not as ``2 gallons 4 pints (9.46 L)''.) 



 500.11 

Measurement of commodity length, how expressed. 



Declaration of net quantity in terms of yards, feet, and inches shall be expressed as follows: 

(a) If less than 1 foot, in terms of inches and fractions thereof. 

(b) If 1 foot or more, in terms of the largest whole unit (a yard or foot) with any remainder in terms of inches or common
or decimal fractions of the foot or yard, except that it shall be optional to express the length in the preceding manner
followed by a statement of the length in terms of inches. 



 500.12 

Measurement of commodities by length and width, how expressed. 



For bidimensional commodities (including roll-type commodities) measured in terms of commodity length and width,
the declaration of net quantity of contents shall be expressed in the following manner: 

(a) The declaration of net quantity for bidimensional commodities having a width of more than 4 inches (10.1 cm) shall:


(1) When the commodity has an area of less than 1 square foot (929 cm2) be expressed in terms of length and width in linear
measure. The customary inch/pound statement is to be expressed in inches and fractions thereof. 

(2) When the commodity has an area of 1 square foot (929 cm2) or more, but less than 4 square feet (37.1 dm2), be expressed
in terms of area, followed by the length and width. The customary inch/pound statement of area is to be expressed in
square inches with length and width expressed in the largest whole unit (yard or foot) with any remainder in inches
or common or decimal fractions of the yard or foot except that a dimension of less than 2 feet (60.9 cm) may be stated in
inches. Commodities consisting of usable individual units (e.g., paper napkins) while requiring a declaration
of unit area need not declare the total area of all such individual units. 

(3) When the commodity has an area of 4 square feet (37.1 dm2) or more, be expressed in terms of area, followed by the length
and width. The customary inch/pound statement of area is to be expressed in square feet with the length and width expressed
in the largest whole units (yards or feet) with any remainder in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the
foot or yard except that a dimension of less than 2 feet (60.96 cm) may be stated in inches. 

(4) For any commodity for which the quantity of contents is required by paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section to include
a declaration of the linear dimensions, the quantity of contents, in addition to being declared in the manner prescribed
by the appropriate provisions of this regulation, may also include, after the customary inch/pound statement of
the linear dimensions of the largest unit of measurement, a parenthetical declaration of the linear dimensions of
said commodity in terms of inches. 




(

Example: 

``25 sq. ft. (12 in. x 8.33 yd.) (12 in. x 300 in.) 



2.32 m2 (30.4 cm x 7.62 m)''.) 




(b) For bidimensional commodities having a width of 4 inches (10.16 cm) or less, the declaration of net quantity shall
be expressed in terms of width and length in linear measure. The customary inch/pound statement of width shall be expressed
in terms of linear inches and fractions thereof, and length shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (yard or foot)
with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fractions of the yard or foot, except that it shall be optional to
express the length in the largest whole unit followed by a statement of length in inches or to express the length in inches
followed by a statement of length in the largest whole unit. 




(

Example: 

``2 inches x 10 yards (5.08 cm x 9.14 m)'', 



``2 inches x 10 yards (360 inches) 5.08 cm x 9.14 m'', or 

``2 inches x 360 inches (10 yards) 5.08 cm x 9.14 m''.) 




 500.13 

Measurement of commodities by area measure only, how expressed. 



For commodities measured in terms of area measure only declaration of net quantity in terms of square yards, square
feet, and square inches shall be expressed in the following manner:

(a) If less than 1 square foot (929 cm2), in terms of square inches and fractions thereof. 

(b) If at least 1 square foot (929 cm2) but less than 4 square feet (37.1 dm2), in terms of square feet with any remainder
in terms of square inches or common or decimal fractions of the square foot. 

(c) If 4 square feet (37.1 dm2) or more, in terms of the largest appropriate whole unit (square yards, square yards and
square feet, or square feet) with any remainder in terms of square inches or common or decimal fractions of the square
foot or square yard. 



 500.14 

Statements of cubic measure and dry measure. 



Statements of cubic measure and dry measure shall be expressed in terms most appropriate to the providing of accurate
information as to the net quantity of contents, and to the facilitating of value comparisons by consumers. When the
content declaration on a commodity sold in compressed form is stated in terms of cubic measure there may also be a statement
indicating the amount of material from which the final product was compressed. Such statement shall not exceed the
actual amount of material that can be recovered. 



 500.15 

Units of count, more than one ply. 



If the commodity is in distinct usable units made up of one or more components or ply, the statement of net quantity of
contents shall (in addition to complying with the requirements of linear and area measurement declaration for each
unit as specified in  500.12) include the number of ply and the total number of usable units. 




(

Example: 

``100 2-ply facial tissues, 81/2 inches x 10 inches'' (21.5 x 25.4 cm).) For the purposes of this section, roll type
commodities (e.g. paper towels), irrespective of perforations, shall not be considered to be usable units, and shall
be labeled in terms of total area measurement and the number of ply. Such area measurement, however, shall be supplemented
by a count statement and the dimensions of a single unit. 



 500.16 

Measurement of container type commodities, how expressed. 



Notwithstanding other provisions of this Part 500 of the regulations pertaining to the expression of net quantity
of contents by measurement, commodities designed and sold at retail to be used as containers for other materials or
objects, such as bags, cups, boxes, and pans, shall be labeled in accordance with the following paragraphs: 

(a) The declaration of net quantity for container commodities shall be expressed as follows: 

(1) For bag type commodities, in terms of count followed by linear dimensions of the bag (whether packaged in a perforated
roll or otherwise) Net quantity of contents in terms of feet and inches shall be expressed as follows: 

(i) When the unit bag is characterized by two dimensions because of the absence of a gusset, the width and length will
be expressed in inches, except that a dimension of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms
of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot.




(

Example: 

``25 bags, 17 in. x 20 in. (43.1 x 50.8 cm)'' or ``200 bags, 20 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. (50.8 x 76.2 cm)'', or ``50 bags, 20 in. x 21/2
ft. (50.8 x 76.2 cm)''.) 




(ii) When the unit bag is gussetted, the dimensions will be expressed as width, depth and length in terms of inches except
that any dimensions of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or the common or decimal
fractions of the foot. 




(

Examples: 

``25 bags, 17 in. x 4 in. x 20 in. (43 x 10 x 50 cm)'', or ``200 bags, 20 in. x 12 in. x 21/2 ft. (50.8 x 30.4 x 76.2 cm)''.) 




(2) For other square, oblong, rectangular or similarly shaped containers, in terms of count followed by length, width,
and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm). 




(

Example: 

``2 cake pans, 8 in. x 8 in. (20.3 x 20.3 cm)'', or ``roasting pan, 12 in. x 8 in. x 3 in. (30.4 x 20.3 x 7.62 cm)''.) 




(3) For circular or other generally round shaped containers, except cups, and the like, in terms of count followed
by diameter and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm). 




(

Example: 

``4 pie pans, 8 in. diameter (20.3 cm)'' or ``2 cake pans, 8 in. diameter x 4 in. (20.3 x 10.1 cm)''.) 




(b) When the functional use of the container is related by label reference in standard terms of measure to the capability
of holding a specific quantity of substance or class of substances such references shall be a part of the net quantity
statement and shall specify capacity as follows: 

(1) Liquid measure for containers which are intended to be used for liquids, semi-solids, viscous materials or mixtures
of solids and liquids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole
U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches, quart, pint, or ounce with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction
of that unit. 




(

Example: 

Freezer Boxes: ``4 boxes, 1 qt. capacity, 6 in. x 6 in. x 4 in. (946 mL capacity, 15.2 x 15.2 x 10.1 cm)''.) 




(2) Dry measure for containers which are intended to be used for solids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity
shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches, peck, dry quart, or dry pint with
any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit. 




(

Example: 

Leaf Bags: ``8 bags, 6 bushel capacity, 4 feet x 5 feet (211 L capacity_1.21 m x 1.52 m)''.) 




(3) Where containers are used as liners for other more permanent containers, in the same terms as are normally used
to express the capacity of the more permanent container. 




(

Example: 

Garbage Can Liners: ``10 liners, 2 ft. 6 in. x 3 ft. 1 in., fits up to 30 gallon cans (76.2 x 93.9 cm, fits up to 113 L cans''.)




(c) Notwithstanding the above requirements, the net quantity statement for containers such as cups will be listed
in terms of count and liquid capacity per unit. 




(

Example: 

``24 cups, 6 fl. oz. capacity (177 mL)''.)

(d) For purposes of this section, the use of the terms ``capacity,'' ``diameter,'' and ``fluid'' is optional. 


 500.17 

Fractions. 


(a) SI metric declarations of net quantity of contents of any consumer commodity may contain only decimal fractions.
Other declarations of net quantity of contents may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be
in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that: 
(1) If there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions
in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed, and 
(2) If linear measurements are required in terms of yards or feet, common fractions may be in terms of thirds. A common
fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than three places.

(b) If a statement includes small fractions, smaller variations in the actual size or weight of the commodity will
be permitted as provided in  500.25, than in cases where the larger fractions or whole numbers are used. 


 500.18 

SI metric prefixes. 


The following chart indicates SI prefixes that may be used on a broad range of consumer commodity labels: 




 500.19 

Conversion of SI metric quantities to inch/pound quantities and inch/pound quantities to SI metric quantities.




(a) For calculating the conversion of SI metric quantities to inch/pound quantities and inch/pound quantities to
metric quantities, the factors in the following chart and none others shall be employed: 


 


(b) The SI metric quantity declaration should be shown in three digits except where the quantity is below 100 grams,
milliliters, centimeters, square centimeters or cubic centimeters, where it can be shown in two figures. In either
case, any final zero appearing to the right of a decimal point need not be shown. 




(

Examples: 

``1 lb (453 g)'' not ``1 lb (453.592 g)''; ``Net Wt. 2 oz (56 g)'' or ``Net Wt 2 oz (56.6 g)'' not ``Net Wt. 2 oz (56.69 g)''.)
