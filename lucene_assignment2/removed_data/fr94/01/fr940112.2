<DOCTITLE>Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that two environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 


In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 
Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms: 






The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA 
(40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that four applications for permits to release genetically engineered organisms into the
environment are being reviewed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The applications have been submitted
in accordance with 7 CFR part 340, which regulates the introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms
and products. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before
introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. 


Pursuant to these regulations, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received and is reviewing the following
applications for permits to release genetically engineered organisms into the environment:

Issuance of permit modifications.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the provisions of   216.33 (d) and (e) of the Regulations Governing
the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), nine public display permits are modified to extend the
authority to take Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (

Tursiops truncatus

) for public display purposes until December 31, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following public display permits have been extended: Public Display Permit No. 558, issued to Loro Parque, S.A.,
38400 Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain; Public Display Permit No. 588, issued to Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, 55
Coogan Boulevard, Mystic, Connecticut 06355-1997; Public Display Permit No. 608, issued to Aquarium of Niagara
Falls, 701 Whirlpool Street, Niagara Falls, New York 14301-1094; Public Display Permit No. 627, issued to Horizons
West, Ltd., dba Marine Life Aquarium, 6001 South Highway 16, Rapid, City, South Dakota 57701; Public Display Permit
No. 628, issued to the Indianapolis Zoological Society, Inc., 1200 West Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana
46222; Public Display Permit No. 632, issued to Marine World Foundation, Marine World Parkway, Vallejo, California
94589; Public Display Permit No. 647, issued to Gulf World, Inc., 15412 Front Beach Road, Panama City Beach, Florida
32407; Public Display Permit No. 649 issued to Marine Animal Productions, Inc., Gulfport, Mississippi 39502-4078;
Public Display Permit No. 656 issued to the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Pier 3, 501 East Pratt Street, Baltimore,
Maryland 21202. All conditions of the original permits and subsequent modifications shall remain in effect.


A voluntary moratorium has been in effect on the removal of dolphins from the Gulf of Mexico since February 1990. During
that time, NMFS has extended the public display permits of permit holders, who had previously been authorized to capture
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, but deferred collecting the animals as a result of the moratorium. The permit holders
listed above have requested that their permits authorizing the collection of dolphins be extended through 1994.
NMFS has granted their requests. However, in light of questions about the status and health of wild populations of
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and the availability of dolphins from sources other than the wild, NMFS is continuing
to ask collectors to participate in a voluntary moratorium on dolphin collection. NMFS will consider requests to
collect only if there is reasonable indication that dolphins from the wild are necessary to maintain a public display
collection.

Georgia Power Co.; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment 






January 6, 1994.




The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicensing of the existing North
Georgia Hydroelectric Project (project). The project is located on the Tallulah, Tugalo, and Chattooga Rivers in
Northeast Georgia and Northwest South Carolina. The project consists of six hydroelectric developments and is within
the Savannah River Basin. 



The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act. 



The EA will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include economic and engineering analyses. 



A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in the final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. 



The purpose of this notice and the scoping document, which is being sent to interested individuals, organizations,
and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns, is to solicit from those entities comments that will assist
the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. 



The scoping document will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed project, (2) identify
preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis, (3) identify reasonable
alternatives to be addressed in the EA, and (4) solicit all available information, especially quantified data, on
the resource issues, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views. 



Written comments must be filed no later than March 3, 1994 with: 
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., 
Washington, DC 20426.



All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: 




North Georgia Hydroelectric Project, (FERC Project No. 2354-018) 





Intervenors, those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties), are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular
resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency. 



A two-day site visit to the project is planned for January 31 and February 1, 1994. Those who wish to attend should contact
Ms. JoLee Gardner, Georgia Power Company, at (404) 526-3576, by January 20, 1994, for details.

<DOCTITLE>Viosca Knoll Gathering System, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>


January 4, 1994.


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Viosca Knoll Gathering System 


[Docket No. CP94-166-000]


Take notice that on December 29, 1993, Viosca Knoll Gathering System (Viosca Knoll), 600 Travis, 7200 Texas Commerce
Tower, Houston, Texas 77002, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-116-000, requesting
that the Commission declare that certain facilities Viosca Knoll proposes to construct along the edge of the Outer
Continental Shelf (OCS) would have the primary function of gathering natural gas and would thereby be exempt from
the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in
the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Viosca Knoll states that it proposes to construct approximately 95 miles of 20-inch O.D. pipeline extending from
a platform owned and operated by Shell Offshore, Inc. in Main Pass Block 252 in a generally southwesterly direction
to a terminating interconnection with the facilities of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) in South Pass
Block 55 Offshore Louisiana. It is stated that Viosca Knoll's facilities would also include, in their initial configuration,
a junction platform and six miles of 16-inch O.D. lateral interconnect with facilities owned by Southern Natural
Gas Company (Southern) in Main Pass Block 289. It is also stated that Viosca Knoll's facilities would interconnect
with production platforms and flow lines from production platforms at numerous locations along its entire length.
Viosca Knoll indicates that its facilities would not include compression, would be operated at pressures ranging
from 900 to 1,350 psig, and would be configured to gather natural gas from both the shallow and deepwater OCS and redeliver
it to the nearest pipeline interconnections having adequate take-away capacity consistent with Viosca Knoll's
objective of providing gas gathering infrastructure along the edge of the OCS. Viosca Knoll states that it is a partnership
composed of Leviathan Gas Pipeline Partners, L.P. (Leviathan), and Tenneco Gas Gathering Co. (Tenneco Gathering)
with each partner holding equal ownership shares. Viosca Knoll further states that Leviathan would be the administrative
operator and that the system would not interconnect with any interstate pipeline affiliated with Leviathan. It is
stated that Tenneco Gathering would physically operate and maintain the facilities. 
Viosca Knoll seeks a declaratory order holding that its proposed facilities would have the primary function of gathering
natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural
Gas Act. Viosca Knoll requests that an expedited decision be issued permitting the facilities to be placed into service
by November 1994. 


Comment date: 

January 25, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 


2. Florida Gas Transmission Co. 


[Docket No. CP94-155-000]


Take notice that on December 22, 1993, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), 1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas
77002, filed in Docket No. CP94-155-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon and transfer by sale to Onyx Pipeline Company, L.C. (Onyx), three compressor
units, 15.7 miles of the Encinal Channel Lateral, the Phillips East White Point Lateral, the Shell East White Point
Lateral, the Nueces Bay Lateral and related metering and appurtenant facilities, including permission to transfer
by sale to Onxy the Phillips Spradley Lateral, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
FGT states that the facilities it has agreed to sell to Onyx are located primarily in San Patricio County, Texas. FGT
further states that the abandonment and sale proposed herein would not impair any current services nor would it disadvantage
any FGT customer. FGT says that the proposed abandonment and sale of the subject facilities would save FGT approximately
$10,500 per year in operating and maintenance costs. 


Comment date: 

January 25, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 


Standard Paragraphs 


F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment
date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest

Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the

<DOCTITLE>Eastern Shore Natural Gas Co., Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


January 6, 1994.


Take notice that Eastern Shore Natural Gas Company (Eastern Shore) tendered for filing on December 30, 1993 certain
revised tariff sheets included in Appendix A to the filing (to be in effect for November and December, 1993 and January,
1994) and also submitted for filing are tariff sheets in Appendix B (regular scheduled quarterly PGA filing) proposed
to be effective February 1, 1994.
Eastern Shore states that the purpose of the instant filing is threefold: (1) To further modify the tracking provisions
contained in Section 24 of the General Terms and Conditions of Eastern Shore's FERC Gas Tariff with respect to its CWS
and CFSS rate schedules; (2) to track changes in Eastern Shore's pipeline suppliers' storage service rates; and (3)
to reflect changes in Eastern Shore's commodity and demand sales rates.
Eastern Shore states that it seeks to reduce its CD commodity and increase its demand sales rates by $0.1559 and $0.1129
per dt, respectively, as compared to those sales rates filed in Eastern Shore's Out-Of-Cycle filing in Docket Nos.
TQ94-2-23-000 and TM94-4-23-000. Such reduction in the CD commodity sales rate
and increase in the demand sales rate are due to (1) lower prices being paid to Eastern Shore's suppliers under its market
responsive gas supply contracts and (2) an increase in demand-related costs from upstream suppliers due to a revision
in their Gas Research Institute (GRI) Charge effective January 1, 1994.
Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested
State Commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance
with Rule 211 and Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such
motions or protests shall be filed on or before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available
for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Ozark Gas Transmission System; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



January 6, 1994.



Take notice that on January 3, 1994 Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas
Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1 the following tariff sheet, with a proposed effective date of February 2, 1994:





Seventh Revised Tariff Sheet No. 4. 




Ozark states that the filing is a general rate case submitted principally to comply with the terms of Ozark's settlement
in Docket No. RP84-53. The filing reflects a base period encompassing the twelve months ending October 31, 1993,
adjusted for known and measurable changes through the nine month period ending July 31, 1994. Ozark states that the
filing utilizes straight fixed-variable rate design, the Ozark method of calculating an equity only rate base, and
projected ITS throughput of 10,000 Dth. The proposed changes would decrease Ozark's cost of service by approximately
$65,856 compared to the cost of service approved by the Commission in Docket No. RS92-72.

Ozark states that copies of the filing were served upon Ozark's jurisdictional customers and interested state regulatory
agencies.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with   385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions and protests should be filed on or
before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be
taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file
a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection
in the public reference room.

<DOCTITLE>Guidance on Determining Environmentally Preferable Products and Services; Notice of Meeting </DOCTITLE>



Agency:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




Action:

 Notice of meeting.





<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing a public meeting to solicit input from all interested parties on developing guidance that Executive
agencies can use in determining the preference and purchase of environmentally preferable products and services.
This meeting is part of a process that EPA has established to obtain public input. The draft guidance is being developed
to implement section 503 of Executive Order on Federal Acquisition, Recycling and Waste Prevention (Executive Order
12873). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


On October 20, 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12873, entitled ``Federal Acquisition, Recycling
and Waste Prevention,'' (58 FR 5411, October 22, 1993). Section 503 of Executive Order 12873 requires EPA to ``issue
guidance that recommends principles that Executive agencies should use in making determinations for the preference
and purchase of environmentally preferable products.'' Draft guidance for implementing this provision is to be
published in the 

Federal Register

 by EPA within 180 days from the effective date of the Executive Order (April 18, 1994). The Executive Order also allows
the Agency to issue additional guidance for public comment on how the principles can be applied to specific product
categories. 




II. Process


To implement section 503 of Executive Order 12873, the Agency is establishing a process whereby public input is solicited
from all interested persons and organizations. This process will include public meetings and discussions with stakeholders
where interested parties will be given an opportunity to comment on a concept paper. This concept paper will be available
in late January and will describe the Agency's preliminary proposal on guiding principles that Federal agencies
should use when making determinations for the preference and purchase of environmentally preferable products.


To schedule oral testimony at the public meeting and to obtain a copy of the concept paper, contact EPA's Public Hearing
Hotline, 110 Hartwell Avenue, Lexington, MA 02173-3198; telephone (617) 674-7374. Callers will receive
mail confirmation of their scheduled testimony and logistical information. Persons who wish to make oral presentations
must restrict testimony to 7 minutes and are also expected to provide three written copies of their completed comments
for inclusion in the official record. If interested parties are unable to attend the public meetings, they are invited
to submit written comments to the Agency.
Finally, the Agency plans to hold a series of stakeholder meetings beginning in February, as time allows, at EPA Headquarters.
The Agency will accept requests for participation in stakeholder meetings on a first-come, first-served basis.
Persons or organizations wishing to sign up for stakeholder meetings with Agency representatives should contact
Claudia O'Brien at the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Due to the limited amount of
time available to develop the draft guidance, the Agency requests that organizations and companies with similar
interests arrange to meet with Agency representatives during the same time period. The Agency may also hold a limited
number of audio or video conferences for persons or organizations lacking travel funding. Interested persons should
contact Claudia O'Brien at the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 


III. Approach


The Agency has been directed by Executive Order 12873 to develop an approach for Federal acquisition of environmentally
preferable products that not only minimizes environmental burden, but also provides incentives to industry to continuously
improve the environmental performance of products and services to the Federal government. Ideally, the approach
would guide Federal agencies in comparing environmental performance among competing products and services, so
that the environmental impact becomes a criterion like cost or performance against which Federal agencies may select
products or services. 

As currently envisioned, the Agency's guidance on acquisition of environmentally preferable products would include
three components: (1) General principles and procedures that apply across product categories and that Federal agencies
can use when implementing acquisition programs for the purchase of environmentally preferable products; (2) guidance
for applying these principles to specific products or product categories (to be developed as appropriate at a later
date); and (3) a code of practice that Federal agencies could use when judging the credibility of non-governmental
environmental certification or eco-labeling programs.

Agreement for Delegation of Authority of the Regulations for Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality
(40 CFR 52.21) Between U.S. EPA and MC


The undersigned, on behalf of the Maricopa County (MC) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.
EPA), hereby agree to the delegation of authority for the administrative, technical and enforcement elements of
the source review provisions of 40 CFR 52.21, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), as they may be amended
and in accordance with the permit review requirements in 40 CFR part 124 subparts A and C, from U.S. EPA to MC, subject
to the terms and conditions below. This delegation is executed pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21(u), Delegation of Authority.


I. General Delegation Conditions


A. Authority is delegated for all sources under the jurisdiction of MC that are subject to review for PSD. This includes
all source categories listed in 40 CFR 52.21 for each pollutant regulated by the Clean Air Act. 
B. This delegation may be amended at any time by the formal written agreement of both MC and U.S. EPA, including amendments
to add, change, or remove conditions or terms of this Agreement. 
C. If the Regional Administrator determines that the County is not implementing or enforcing the PSD program in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this delegation, the requirements of 40 CFR 52.21, 40 CFR 124, or the Clean Air Act,
this delegation, after consultation with MC, may be revoked in whole or in part. Any such revocation shall be effective
as of the date specified in a Notice of Revocation to the County. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude U.S. EPA from
exercising its enforcement authority, as provided in paragraph V.B. below. 
D. The permit appeal provisions of 40 CFR 124.19 shall apply to all appeals to the Administrator on permits issued by
MC under this delegation. For purposes of implementing the federal permit appeal provisions under this delegation,
if there is a public comment requesting a change in a draft preliminary determination or draft permit conditions,
the final permit issued by MC is required to contain statements which indicate that for Federal PSD purposes and in
accordance with 40 CFR 124.15 and 124.19, (1) the effective date of the permit is 30 days after the final decision to
issue, modify, revoke and reissue the permit; and (2) if an appeal is made to the Administrator, the effective date
of the permit is suspended until such time as the appeal is resolved. MC shall inform U.S. EPA (Region IX) in accordance
with conditions of this delegation when there is public comment requesting a change in the preliminary determination
or in a draft permit condition. Failure by MC to comply with the terms of this paragraph shall render the subject permit
invalid for Federal PSD purposes. 
E. By this agreement, MC assumes authority for enforcement and permit modification/amendment for EPA issued NSR/PSD
permits. 
F. This delegation of authority becomes effective upon the date that both parties have signed the Agreement. 


II. Communications Between U.S. EPA and MC 


MC and U.S. EPA will use the following communication procedures: 
A. MC shall report to U.S. EPA on a quarterly basis the compliance status of the sources that have received a PSD permit
from either MC or U.S. EPA. The Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) will be used for this purpose. Compliance
determinations will be made with respect to the conditions established in the PSD permits. 
B. MC shall forward to U.S. EPA, at the beginning of the public comment period for each PSD permit, a summary of (1) the
findings related to each PSD application, (2) the justification for MC's preliminary determination, and (3) a copy
of the draft permit. Should there be any comments or concerns about the pending PSD permit, U.S. EPA shall communicate
these comments and concerns to MC as soon as possible prior to the close of the public comment period. 
C. MC shall forward to EPA Region IX (attn: A-5-1) copies of the final action on the PSD permit applications
at the time of issuance, as well as copies of substantive public comments. MC must address any public comments not incorporated
into the permit, and shall provide a summary of the responses.

D. MC shall send U.S. EPA copies of preliminary determinations on PSD permit modifications and amendments at or prior
to the beginning of the public comment period. U.S. EPA will provide comments to MC prior to the close of the public comment
period.
E. MC shall send to EPA a copy of all applicability determinations and justifications made that would involve PSD exemptions
due to offsetting or netting (40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and 52.21(b)(21).


III. Revisions to Title 40 CFR 52.21


A. This delegation covers any revisions that are promulgated for 40 CFR 52.21 and 40 CFR 124. The terms ``40 CFR 52.21''
and ``40 CFR 124'' as used in the delegation request and throughout this Agreement, include such regulations as are
in effect on the date this Agreement is executed and any revisions that are promulgated after that date.
B. In addition, the following U.S. EPA policies shall apply to PSD review:
1. U.S. EPA is responsible for the issuance of PSD permits on Indian Lands, under sections 110(c) and 301 of the Clean
Air Act. States (or their delegates) have no authority to establish air pollution control requirements on Indian
Reservations, unless requested to by the Tribal Governing Body. 
2. According to U.S. EPA guidance published on September 22, 1987 and supplemental guidance published on July 28,
1988, all delegated agencies must now consider pollutants not subject to the Clean Air Act in their Best Available
Control Technology (BACT) determinations. The BACT determinations must include a review of the toxic effects of
unregulated pollutants and the impact of the proposed BACT on the emissions of these pollutants.
3. MC shall consult with the appropriate Federal, State, and local land use agencies prior to issuance of preliminary
determinations on PSD permits. In particular, U.S. EPA requires that MC shall:
(a) Notify the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and U.S. EPA when a PSD permit application has been received, in order
to assist U.S. EPA in carrying out its non-delegable responsibilities under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act
(PL 97-304).
(b) Notify potential applicants of the potential need for consultation between U.S. EPA and the FWS if an endangered
species may be affected by the project. U.S. EPA's data sheet may be used for this process (copy enclosed).
(c) Refrain from issuing a final PSD permit unless the FWS has determined that the proposed project will not adversely
affect any endangered species.
4. MC shall consider a dry scrubber for sulfur dioxide control, a baghouse or electrostatic precipitator for particulate
control, and efficient combustion techniques for carbon monoxide control in their BACT determinations for municipal
waste combustors pursuant to U.S. EPA guidance published on June 26, 1987.
5. MC shall begin any BACT determination with the most stringent control options available for that category, pursuant
to additional BACT guidance issued on December 1, 1987. U.S. EPA will consider as deficient any BACT determination
not complying with this ``top-down'' requirement.
6. Upon notification from EPA, MC shall implement such new regulations or directives pending revision of this Agreement.


IV. Permits


A. In any matter involving interpretation of sections 160-169 of the Clean Air Act, or 40 CFR 52.21, and of 40 CFR
124 where guidance on the implementation, review, administration, or enforcement of these sections has not been
sent to MC, U.S. EPA will be contacted and requested to provide the appropriate guidance.
B. MC shall at no time grant any waiver to the PSD permit requirements.
C. Permits issued under this delegation shall contain language certifying that the Federal PSD requirements have
been satisfied.

D. Authorities to Construct must include appropriate provisions, as specified in Attachment A, to ensure permit
enforceability. Permit conditions shall, at a minimum, contain reporting requirements on initiation of construction,
startup, and where applicable, source testing and continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS). In all cases
where tests are required, the tests methods shall be specified. All cases where CEMS are required, appropriate testing
and reporting requirements shall be included. Upset/breakdown and malfunction conditions shall be included in
all permits. 

E. U.S. EPA will assist MC in the BACT determination for all PSD permit applications filed with MC, such that U.S. EPA
and MC jointly concur on each BACT determination. The signatures of U.S. EPA and MC on the final permit shall constitute
concurrence on the BACT determinations 

F. All modeling analyses for determination of increment consumption and compliance with the NAAQS will require the
joint concurrence of U.S. EPA and MC. The signatures of U.S. EPA and MC on the final permit shall constitute concurrence
on the modeling analyses. 

G. Separate from conditions E and F and for a given time as specified in this subpart, U.S. EPA and MC shall jointly concur
on the entire analysis and permit conditions for each PSD permit issued. This requirement for dual concurrence shall
be waived beginning with the first application submitted and deemed complete two (2) years after the date of this agreement,
or after U.S. EPA concurs with MC on ten (10) final permits issued pursuant to this delegation agreement, whichever
occurs later. In any event, U.S. EPA shall provide written notice to MC when the requirement for dual concurrence no
longer applies. 

H. MC shall conduct an annual review of the NO

2

 increment status for each Section 107 area designated as attainment over which it has jurisdiction and shall prepare
a summary report of the review. Such review shall be made in accordance with current U.S. EPA guidance as provided to
MC. Emissions from the following sources consume NO

2

 increment: (1) any new major stationary source or modification of a major stationary source on which construction
begins after February 8, 1988; and (2) minor, area, and mobile sources, after the minor source baseline date, as it
is defined by 40 CFR 52.21. The initial review of the NO

2

 increment status shall address the consumption of NO

2

 increment between February 8, 1988, and the effective date of this agreement. 

I. MC shall conduct an annual review, similar to the one in preceeding subpart H, on the status of the PM

10

 increment. For that part of Maricopa County designated nonattainment for TSP, the requirement for tracking PM

10

 increment consumption becomes effective on the date of receipt of the first major source application deemed complete
after the June 3, 1994, implementation date for PM

10

 increments. For all other areas within Maricopa County, the minor source baseline date established for TSP remains
in effect, but PM

10

 increments replace TSP increments as the particulate matter indicator. 

J. U.S. EPA shall retain the responsibility of issuing the PSD permit for Palo Verde Steel, but enforcement of the final
permit terms and conditions on the source shall be under local authority. 



V. Permit Enforcement 



A. The primary responsibility for enforcement of the PSD regulations as found in 40 CFR part 52 in Maricopa County will
rest with MC, except where responsibility is vested in the State of Arizona. Pursuant to A.R.S. 49-402, the State
of Arizona has original jurisdiction over the following sources in Maricopa County: 

1. Smelting of metal ore. 

2. Petroleum refineries. 

3. Coal fired electrical generating stations. 

4. Portland cement plants. 

5. Air pollution generated by portable sources unless delegated to MC. 

6. Air pollution by mobile sources for the purpose of regulating those sources as prescribed by A.R.S. Title 49, Chapter
3, Articles 4 & 5.

MC will enforce the provisions that pertain to the PSD program, except in those cases where the rules or policy of MC
are more stringent. In such cases, MC may elect to implement the more stringent requirements. 

B. Nothing in this delegation agreement shall prohibit EPA from enforcing the PSD provisions of the Clean Air Act,
the PSD regulations or any PSD permit issued by MC pursuant to this Agreement. 

C. In the event that MC is unwilling or unable to enforce a provision of this delegation with respect to a source subject
to the PSD regulations, MC will immediately notify the Regional Administrator. Failure to notify the Regional Administrator
does not preclude U.S. EPA from exercising its enforcement authority.

Attachment A


All Authorities to Construct, where applicable, shall contain: 
1. Identification of all points of emission, both stack and fugitive. 
2. Specification of a numerical emission limitation for each point of emission in terms of mass rate and/or concentration
limitations. If emission testing based on a numerical emission limitation is infeasible, the permit may instead
prescribe a design, operational, or equipment standard. Any permits issued without numerical emission limitations
must contain conditions which assure that the design characteristics or equipment will be properly maintained or
that the operational conditions will be properly performed so as to continuously achieve the assumed degree of control.

3. Limitations or factors which were the basis for the air quality impact analysis must be specified (e.g. hours of
operation, stack height, materials processed which affect emissions). 
4. Methods and frequency of determining continued compliance for each point of emission (such as from the SIP or if
the source is subject to New Source Performance Standards [NSPS] or National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants [NESHAP] or explicitly identified if a reference method is not used. 
5. Recordkeeping requirements which enable the agency to ascertain continued compliance, especially where factors
such as hours of operation, throughput of materials, sulfur content of fuels, fuel usage, and type or quantity of materials
processed are conditions of the permit. 



6. A condition that the permit such that it will expire if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months
or a shorter period. 



7. A condition that the source is responsible for providing sampling and testing facilities at its own expense. 



8. A condition that continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) will be used for enforcement purposes. 



9. Reporting requirements which enable the agency to monitor the following: 



(a) Progress of source construction including the date by which construction is completed; and 



(b) Compliance with (1) emission limitations, (2) operational limitations, (3) and work practice standards; the
reporting requirements should include excess emissions reports and source test results. 
10. Permits issued under this delegation should contain language certifying that the federal PSD requirements have
been satisfied. 
11. As a courtesy to sources exempted from PSD review due to federally enforceable operational or process restrictions,
or the use of controls more stringent than required by applicable SIP limits, the source shall be advised that any relaxation
of those limits may subject the entire source to full PSD review as if construction had not yet begun. Suggested language
is as follows:

 

This source is exempt from PSD review because of * * * (state reason, for example, ``the requirement
that limits operation to eight hours per day''). Any relaxation in this limit which increases your potential to emit
above the applicable PSD threshold will require a full PSD review of the affected source as if construction had not
yet commenced.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration; Rescission of Authority; 
Fresno County, CA

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Rescission of local PSD permitting authority. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Director, Air & Toxics Division, for EPA Region IX, San Francisco has rescinded local Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) permitting authority in Fresno County, California. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
In September 1991, the State of California passed legislation that effectively required the eight separate counties
of the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin to form a single air pollution control district (APCD). EPA had delegated PSD authority
to Fresno County APCD by an agreement dated December 23, 1985. Because the San Joaquin Valley Unified APCD has chosen
to defer to EPA the regulation of sources subject to PSD rules at 40 CFR 52.21, EPA is responding to their request to rescind
PSD authority previously delegated to Fresno County APCD. 
The following letter represents the terms and conditions of the rescission. 




The PSD Delegation of Authority is reviewable under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act only in the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals. A petition for review must be filed by March 14, 1994.

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 



April 9, 1993. 



David L. Crow, 


Executive Director/APCO, 
San Joaquin Valley, Unified Air Pollution Control District, 
1999 Tuolumne Street, Suite 200, 
Fresno, CA 93721.





Dear Mr. Crow: This letter responds to your request to EPA to rescind Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)
permitting authority in Fresno and Kern counties. We recognize that the request, dated March 16, 1993, and received
by this office on March 19, 1993, is consistent with ongoing efforts to attain a more coordinated approach to air quality
management in the San Joaquin Valley. 


In September 1991, the State of California passed legislation that effectively required the formation of a single
air pollution control district in the Valley Air Basin. To that end, eight counties joined efforts in March 1992 to
form the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District. The District comprises the counties of Fresno,
Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties, as well as that part of Kern County located in
the Valley Air Basin. By August 1992, the California Air Resources Board certified that the District met the requirements
stated in SB 124. 


EPA had specifically transferred PSD authority to Fresno County APCD by a delegation agreement, dated December 23,
1985. As mentioned in your letter, the District has chosen to defer to EPA the regulation of sources subject to PSD rules
at 40 CFR 52.21. Therefore, EPA hereby rescinds authority delegated to Fresno County APCD to regulate sources subject
to the federal PSD rules. Please note that no such agreement was made between EPA and Kern County, so that your request
to rescind PSD authority in that county requires no further action. 


Pursuant to grant conditions under  105 (Program Objective 5), the District shall continue to provide to EPA
notification, as soon as possible and prior to deeming the application complete, of all new major stationary sources
and major modifications that may be subject to the federal PSD regulation. Specifically, this affects major stationary
sources and major modifications to existing sources, as defined under part 52.21(b), that are located in areas designated
as attainment within the San Joaquin Valley Unified APCD. The District should also provide notification to sources
potentially affected by the federal PSD requirements. These sources must submit PSD permit applications to EPA and
may be subject to enforcement action if construction commences before EPA issues a final PSD permit. 


We look forward to continued cooperation with you and your staff, so that permits may be issued in a timely and effective
manner. If you have further questions regarding this matter, please contact Jessica Gaylord of my staff at (415) 744-1256.




  Sincerely, 


<SIGNER>

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Approval of Amendment to Texas Plan for Certification of Applicators of Compound 1080 Livestock Protection
Collars </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of approval of amended certification plan.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 13, 1993, EPA announced its intention to approve an amendment to the Texas Plan for Certification of Applicators
of Compound 1080 Livestock Protection Collars (LPC's). Public comments were solicited on this amended plan. The
amended plan permits pooling of LPC's among certified LPC applicators. No comments were received and EPA therefore
approves the amended plan. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with the provision of section 11(a)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA) and 40 CFR part 171, the Texas Department of Agriculture submitted to EPA for approval, revisions to its current
plan for certification of LPC applicators. The amendment to the Texas LPC certification plan permits the designation
of collar pool agents. Certified LPC applicators are permitted to participate in a collar pool administered by a collar
pool agent. The purpose of the collar pool is to reduce the number of LPC's in circulation by a pooling of LPC's. Certified
LPC applicators will check out the LPC's from the collar pool agent immediately prior to use. When no longer needed,
a LPC will be returned to the collar pool agent for distribution to another certified LPC applicator. All collar pool
agents are considered agents of the registrant and are required to keep the same records. Further, the collar pool
system will not affect the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of LPC users. EPA announced its intention to approve
the amended plan in the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43115), and solicited comments. No comments were received and EPA therefore approves the
amended plan. 


Copies of the amended plan are available for review at the following locations during normal business hours: 
1. Texas Department of Agriculture, Stephen F. Austin Building, Rm. 1034F, 17th St. and Congress Ave., Austin, TX
78711, Telephone 512-463-0013.

<DOCTITLE>Iprodione; Establishment of a Temporary Tolerance </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has established a temporary tolerance for the combined residues of the fungicide Iprodione, its isomer and its
metabolite in or on the raw agricultural commodity cotton seed. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Rhone-Poulenc AG Company, P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, has requested
in pesticide petition (PP) 1G3998, the establishment of a temporary tolerance for the combined residues of the fungicide
Iprodione [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-

N

-(methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboximide], its isomer [3-(1-methylethyl)-

N

-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboximide], and its metabolite [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboximide]
in or on the raw agricultural commodity cotton seed at 0.10 parts per million (ppm). This temporary tolerance will
permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodity when treated in accordance with the provisions of the
experimental use permit 264-EUP-91, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 


The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment
of the temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been established
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
2. Rhone-Poulenc AG Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
This tolerance expires January 1, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural
commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance
may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide
indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has extended a temporary tolerance for residues of the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris (

O

-ethylphosphonate) in or on the raw agricultural commodity cotton at 0.20 parts per million (ppm). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

  EPA issued a notice, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19428), announcing the establishment of temporary tolerance for residues of the fungicide fosetyl-Al,
aluminum tris (

O

-ethylphosphonate) in or on the raw agricultural commodity cotton at 0.20 parts per million (ppm). This tolerance
was issued in response to pesticide petition (PP) 1G3997, submitted by Rhone-Poulenc AG Company, P.O. Box 12014,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709. 


This temporary tolerance has been extended to permit the continued marketing of the raw agricultural commodity named
above when treated in accordance with the provisions of experimental use permit 264-EUP-91, which is being issued
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat.
819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 
The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the extension
of this temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been extended
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

1. The total amount of the active fungicide to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental use
permit.
2. Rhone-Poulenc AG Company must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration.
This tolerance expires January 1, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural
commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance
may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide
indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12291. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<DOCTITLE>Cancellation of Tariffs for Failure To Comply With Automated Tariff Filing and Information System (``ATFI'') Filing
Requirements</DOCTITLE>


By Order published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 50550) on September 28, 1993 (``September Order''), the Commission directed 103 carriers with tariffs on file
in the Worldwide, Asian and South Pacific trade areas to show cause by November 12, 1993, why their paper tariffs should
not be cancelled for failure to register and file a tariff in ATFI by the required date (i.e., June 4, 1993). This action
was taken pursuant to section 8 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (U.S.C. app. 1707), the Commission's regulations implementing
ATFI at 46 CFR part 514 and Supplemental Report Nos. 2, 3 and 4
 issued in Docket No. 90-23, Notice of Inquiry on Ocean Freight Tariffs in Foreign and Domestic Offshore Commerce
(Automated Tariff Filing and Information System). 




World Tariff Services, Inc. (``WTS''), filed the only formal response to the September Order. It did so on behalf of
26 carriers named in the Order.
 Other carriers contacted the Commission informally by letter or telephone or filed their tariff in ATFI. The Commission
did not receive any response whatsoever from 42 of the respondents. 




WTS states that 14 of the carriers named in its response have satisfied the Commission's requirements and filed an
ATFI tariff, that three carriers have ceased doing business and have voluntarily cancelled their tariffs, and that
nine other carriers either have completed the ATFI registration process, are in the process of doing so, or recently
submitted the necessary information to WTS so that it may initiate ATFI registration. Two of those carriers have in
fact completed the registration process and filed an ATFI tariff.
The 42 carriers that did not respond to the September Order and have not registered in ATFI or filed an ATFI tariff will
have their tariffs or portions of tariffs currently on file with the Commission with Worldwide, Asian or South Pacific
scopes cancelled. Twenty-five carriers responded and/or registered for ATFI, but did not file the required tariff.
These carriers, which include seven of WTS's clients, have not provided sufficient grounds to justify their failure
to file. Accordingly, these carriers also will have their tariffs or applicable portions of their tariffs cancelled.
Carriers who have filed their tariffs in ATFI will be dismissed from the proceeding. 


Therefore, it is ordered, 

That the tariffs or portions of tariffs currently on file with the Commission with Worldwide, Asian or South Pacific
scope of the carriers identified in Appendix A to this Order are cancelled effective upon publication of the Order
in the 

Federal Register

.


It is further ordered, 

That the parties listed in Appendix B to this Order are dismissed from this proceeding. 



By the Commission.

Federal Register

.
The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger

<DOCTITLE>California and Hawaiian Sugar Co.</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of period for public comment on petition to modify or vacate consent order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (``C&H''), a respondent in Docket No. C-2858, is subject to an order
prohibiting it from representing that its granulated sugar is different or superior unless (a) such difference or
superiority relates to a consumer use of such sugar which is specified in the advertisement; (b) such difference or
superiority is substantiated; and (c) such substantiation includes competent and reliable evidence that the difference
or superiority is discernible to or of benefit to the class of consumers to whom the representation is directed. C&H
filed a petition on December 16, 1993, requesting that the Commission reopen and modify the order to allow C&H
to advertise all truthful, nondeceptive differences between its sugar and competing sugar that are substantiated
by competent and reliable evidence. In the alternative, C&H requests that the Commission vacate the order.


This document announces the public comment period on this petition.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The order in Docket No. C-2858 was published at 42 FR 6800 on February 4, 1977, reported at 89 F.T.C. 15. C&H
argues that significant changes in constitutional law and Commission policy since 1976 justify reopening the docket
and modifying the order. C&H maintains that the U.S. Supreme Court has extended First Amendment protection to
purely commercial speech and views as particularly suspect prohibitions on expression such as those in the order.
C&H also contends that the burden of proof in restricting commercial speech lies with the party seeking to restrict
it and that the Commission has provided no evidence that the order directly advances its interests in a reasonable
manner. In addition, C&H argues that since 1976 the Commission altered its position concerning truthful comparative
advertising and now actively encourages such advertising. C&H notes that since 1976 the Commission has adopted
a ``reasonable consumer'' standard. C&H also contends that the public interest justifies reopening and setting
aside the order because consumers have a constitutional right to receive uncensored distribution of truthful information.
Furthermore, C&H maintains that market efficiency requires that consumers be given access to truthful information
and that the order improperly discriminates among competitors. The petition was placed on the public record on December
23, 1993.

<USBUREAU>Health Resources and Services Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement for the Disadvantaged Health Professions </DOCTITLE>
Faculty Loan Repayment Program 



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that 
applications for fiscal year (FY) 1994, for the Disadvantaged Health Professions Faculty Loan Repayment Program
(FLRP) are now being accepted under section 738 (a) of the Public Health Service Act (The Act), as amended by the Health
Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 
In FY 1994, approximately $800,000 is available for competing applications for the Disadvantaged Health Professions
Faculty Loan Repayment Program. It is expected that 26 awards averaging $30,000 ($15,000 per year for two years) will
be supported with these funds. 


Previous Funding Experience 


Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. In fiscal years 1991, 1992 and 1993, a total of 91 awards,
averaging $24,000 ($12,000 per year for 2 years) were made. 


Purpose 


The purpose of the Disadvantaged Health Professions Faculty Loan Repayment Program (FLRP) is to attract disadvantaged
health professions faculty members for accredited health professions schools. The program provides a financial
incentive for degree-trained health professions personnel from disadvantaged backgrounds who will serve as members
of the faculties of those schools. The FLRP is directed at those individuals available to serve immediately or within
a short time as ``new'' full-time faculty members. 
Loan repayment may be provided only for an individual who has 

not 

been a member of the faculty of any school at any time during the 18-month period preceding the date on which the Secretary
receives the request of the individual for a repayment contract (i.e., ``new'' faculty). 
Section 738(b) makes available grants and contracts with schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry,
veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatric medicine, pharmacy, public health, health administration, clinical
psychology and other public or private nonprofit health or educational entities to assist in increasing the number
of underrepresented minority faculty. Section 738(b) will be implemented as a separate program. 


Eligible Individuals 


Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are eligible to compete for participation in the FLRP if they: 
1. Have a degree in medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, 
nursing, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, optometry, veterinary 
medicine, public health or clinical psychology; or 
2. Are enrolled in an approved graduate training program in one 
of the health professions listed above; or 
3. Are enrolled as a full-time student in the final year of health 
professions training, leading to a degree from an eligible school. 
Established faculty members are not eligible to apply for funds under the FLRP. Only individuals that have not taught
in the last 18 (eighteen) months prior to application to the program will be considered. 


Statutory Requirements 


Prior to submitting an application, eligible individuals must sign a contract, as prescribed by the Secretary, setting
forth the terms and conditions of the FLRP. This contract requires the individual to have entered into a contract with
an eligible school to serve as a full-time member of the faculty, as determined by the school, for not less than 2 years,
whereby the school agrees to pay, for each year, a sum (in addition to faculty salary) equal to that paid by the Secretary
towards the repayment of principal due on the applicant's health professions educational loans. Additionally,
the individual involved may not have been a member of the faculty of any school at any time during the last 18 months prior
to application to the program. 


Eligible Schools 


Eligible health professions schools are public or nonprofit private accredited schools of medicine, osteopathic
medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, optometry, veterinary medicine or public health, or schools
that offer graduate programs in clinical psychology and which are located in States as provided in section 799 of the
Act. Schools of nursing are also eligible, as defined in section 853 of the Act. 


Provisions of the Loan Repayment Program 


Section 738 (a) authorizes repayment, for any year for which repayments are made, not to exceed 20 percent of the outstanding
principal and interest on the individual's educational loans. Of the repayment, the Secretary pays half, up to $20,000.
The school pays an equal amount, unless the Secretary determines that the repayment will impose an undue financial
hardship on the school in which case, the Secretary may pay up to the entire 20 percent. 
The school is required, for each such year, to make payments of principal and interest in an amount equal to the amount
of payment made by the Secretary for that year. These payments must be in addition to the faculty salary the participant
otherwise would receive. 
Allowable educational loan repayment expenses include the following: 
1. Tuition expenses; 
2. All other reasonable educational expenses such as fees, books, 
supplies, educational equipment and materials required by the school, and incurred by the applicant; 
3. Reasonable living expenses, as determined by the Secretary; and 
4. Partial payments of the increased Federal income tax liability 
caused by the FLRP's payments and considered to be ``other income,'' if the recipient requests such assistance. 
Prior to entering into an agreement for repayment of loans, the Secretary requires satisfactory evidence of the existence
and reasonableness of the individual's educational loans, including a copy of the original written loan agreement
establishing the outstanding educational loan. 


Waiver Provision 


In the event of undue financial hardship to a school, the school may obtain from the Secretary a waiver of its share of
payments while the participant is serving under the terms of the contract. For purposes of this program, ``undue financial
hardship'', as seen by the Secretary, is based on a school's particular financial status as influenced by such circumstances
as budget cutbacks. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and may 
be supported by the school's documentation of comparative yearly financial allocation of funds; or the most current
certified public accounting audit, including the Balance Sheet and Statement of Income and Expenses for the past
several years. 
If the Secretary waives the school's payment requirement, the amount of the Federal loan repayment may be up to the
full 20 percent described above (regardless of the ``equal amount'' provision described above), but cannot exceed
the $20,000 repayment limit. The participant must pay that portion of loan payment due which is not covered. 

The following Definitions, Program Requirements, Review Criteria and Funding Preference were established in FY
1991 after public comment dated October 2, 1991, at 56 FR 49896, and the Secretary is extending them in FY 1994.

Definitions 



For purposes of the FLRP in FY 1994, an ``Individual from a Disadvantaged 
Background'' is defined as in 42 CFR 57.1804, as one who: 

1. Comes from an environment that has inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skill, and abilities
required to enroll in and graduate from a health professions school, or from a program providing education or training
in an allied health profession; or 

2. Comes from a family with an annual income below a level based on low 
income thresholds according to a family size published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted annually for changes
in the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary for use in health professions and nursing programs. The
Secretary will periodically publish these income levels in the 

Federal Register

. The following income figures determine what constitutes a low income family for purposes of the Faculty Loan Repayment
Program for FY l994. 







The term ``Living expenses'' means the costs of room and board, transportation and commuting costs, and other costs
incurred during an individual's attendance at a health professions school, as estimated each year by the school as
part of the school's standard student budget. (National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, 42 CFR 62.22)


The term ``Reasonable educational expenses and living expenses'' means the costs of those educational and living
expenses which are equal to or less than the sum of the school's estimated standard student budgets for educational
and living expenses for the degree program and for the year(s) during which the Program participant is/was enrolled
in the school. (National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, 42 CFR 62.22) 

The term ``Unserved Obligation Penalty'' means the amount equal to the number of months of obligated service that
were not completed by an individual, multiplied by $1,000, except that in any case in which the individual fails to
serve 1 year, the unserved obligation penalty shall be equal to the full period of obligated service multiplied by
$1,000. (Section 
338E of the Act) See ``Breach of Contract'' section below. 



Program Requirements 



The following requirements will be applied to the applicant and to the school.

<PARENT> FR940112-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Applicant 



The applicant will be required to do the following: 

1. Submit a completed application, including the applicant's contract with an eligible school to serve as a full-time
faculty member for not less than 2 years;

2. Provide evidence that the applicant has completely satisfied any other obligation for health professional service
which is owed under an agreement with the Federal Government, State Government, or other entity prior to beginning
the period of service under this program;

3. Certify that the applicant is not delinquent on any amounts which are owed to the Federal Government; and

4. Provide documentation to evidence the educational loans and to verify their status.



The School



The participating school will be required to do the following:

1. Enter into a contractual agreement with the applicant whereby the school is required, for each year for which the
participant serves as a faculty member, to make payments of principal and interest in an amount equal to the amount
of such quarterly payments made by the Secretary. These payments must be in addition to the faculty salary the participant
otherwise would receive.

2. Verify the participant's continuous employment at intervals as prescribed by the Secretary.

If the school is unable to meet the requirement of the FLRP for payment of principal and interest due because the requirement
would impose undue financial hardship on the school, the school may request a waiver of this obligation from the Secretary.
If the school's proportionate share of loan repayment amounts is waived, the Federal Government agrees to make payments
of not more than $20,000 of principal and interest for a year, which includes the amount granted as a waiver to the school.

The Secretary will pay participants in equal quarterly payments during the period of service.



Effective Date of Contract



After an applicant has been approved for participation in the FLRP, the Director, Division of Disadvantaged Assistance
(DDA), will send the applicant a contract with the Secretary. The effective date is either the date work begins at the
school as a faculty member or the date the Director, DDA, signs the FLRP contract, whichever is later. Service should
begin no later than September 30, 1994.



Breach of Contract



The following areas under Breach of Contract are addressed in the appended 
contract:

1. If the participant fails to serve his or her period of obligated faculty service (minimum of 2 years) as contracted
with the school, he/she is then in breach of contract, and neither the Secretary nor the school is obligated to continue
loan repayments as stated in the contract. The participant must then reimburse the Secretary and the participating
school for all sums of principal and interest paid on his/her behalf as stated in the contract in addition to any income
tax assistance he/she may have received.

2. Regardless of the length of the agreed period of obligated service (2, 3, or more years), a participant who serves
less than the time period specified in his/her contract is liable for monetary damages to the United States amounting
to the sum of the total of the amounts the Program paid him/her, plus an ``unserved obligation penalty'' of $1,000 for
each month unserved.

3. Any amount which the United States is entitled to recover because of a breach of the FLRP contract must be paid within
1 year from the day the Secretary determines that the participant is in breach of contract. If payment is not received
by the payment date, additional interest, penalties and administrative charges will be assessed in accordance with
Federal Law (45 CFR 30.13).



Review Criteria



The HRSA will review fiscal year 1994 applications taking into consideration the following criteria:

Contract for the Disadvantaged Health Professions Faculty Loan Repayment Program With U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, Public Health Service, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Bureau of Health Professions





Section 738 of the Public Health Service Act (``Act'') [42 United States Code 293 et seq.], as added by Pub. L. 102-408,
authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (``Secretary'') to repay the educational loans of applicants
from disadvantaged backgrounds selected to be participants in the Loan Repayment Program Regarding Service on Faculties

applicants must agree to provide teaching faculty services at an approved accredited health professions school
determined by the Secretary for a designated period of obligated service pursuant to section 738 of the Act.



Sections 738(a) (5) and (7) of the Act require applicants to submit with their applications a signed contract with
an accredited health professions school and a signed contract which states the terms and conditions of participation

The applicant must pay that portion not covered.



3. Make loan repayments for a year of obligated service no later than the end of the fiscal year in which the applicant
completes such year of service.

2. If the applicant's eligibility to participate in the Faculty Loan Repayment Program is based on section 738(a)(2)
of the Act (i.e. based on his or her enrollment in an accredited health professions school), he or she also agrees to:

in clinical psychology in which the applicant is currently enrolled, until completion of such course of study;

b. Enter into a contract with an accredited school described in subsection (a) of Section 738 to serve as a ``new'' member
of the faculty of the school for not less than 2 years according to the requirements described in subsection (a)(5)
of section 738.

c. Begin service obligations as contracted.



Section C_Breach of Written Loan Repayment Contract



1. If the participant fails to comply with section B.1.c. of this contract or is dismissed for disciplinary reasons
or voluntarily terminates the contracts, neither the Secretary nor the School is obligated to continue loan repayments
as stated in Sec. A of this Contract. The participant shall be liable to the United States and the School for the amounts
specified in paragraph 2 of this section.

2. If the applicant agrees to serve as a full-time faculty member for two years or more and fails to serve the 2-year minimum

charges for past due payments.

3. The ``Unserved Obligation Penalty'' means the amount equal to the number of months of obligated services that were
not completed by an individual, multiplied by $1,000 except that in any case in which the individual fails to serve
1 year, the unserved obligation penalty shall be equal to the full period of obligated service multiplied by $1,000.

4. If the applicant agrees to serve more than the 2-year minimum service obligations and has completed the 2-year minimum
he or she will be liable for such sums paid for any months that are not a full year beyond the 2-year minimum requirement
as agreed to in Section B.1.c of this contract, plus an ``unserved obligation penalty'' of $1,000 for each month unserved.

5. Any amount the United States is entitled to recover shall be paid within one year of the date the Secretary determines
that the applicant is in breach of this written contract. Failure to pay by the due date will incur delinquent charges
provided by Federal Law. (45 CFR 30.13).



Section D_Cancellation, Suspension, & Waiver of Obligation

<DOCTITLE>Social Security Ruling SSR 94-1c; Supplemental Security Income_Disability_Illegal Activity as Substantial
Gainful Activity </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Social Security ruling. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling
94-1c. This Ruling is based on the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 

Dotson 

v. 

Shalala, 

which affirmed the U.S. district court decision upholding the decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
denying the claimant's application for disability benefits under the supplemental security income program. Among
other things, the court of appeals determined that the decision of the Secretary that the illegal activity in which
the claimant engaged to support a drug addiction constituted substantial gainful activity (SGA) was consistent
with the Social Security Act and the Secretary's regulations and supported by substantial evidence, and that in determining
whether such activity was SGA, the cost of the claimant's narcotics could not be deducted from the claimant's income
as an impairment-related work expense. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). 


Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,
disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based
on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations. 
Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases. 
If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect.

Dotson 

v. 

Shalala, 

1 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 1993) 






The claimant applied for disability benefits under the supplemental security income program, alleging that he was
disabled due to asthma, multiple allergies, and past drug abuse. His application was denied initially and upon reconsideration
and he requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). At the hearing, the claimant testified that he
currently used $200-$300 worth of narcotics each day and that he supported his drug habit through stealing and
panhandling. Based on the claimant's testimony, the ALJ concluded that the claimant's stealing and panhandling
constituted substantial gainful activity (SGA) worth an average of approximately $5,600 per month. Specifically,
the ALJ found that due to the poor area in which the claimant panhandled, the bulk of his income must be derived from stealing,
which the ALJ determined involved significant physical and mental activities. The ALJ concluded that because the
claimant was engaging in SGA, he was not disabled and, therefore, not eligible for disability benefits. The Appeals
Council declined to review the ALJ's decision which became the final decision of the Secretary. The claimant sought
judicial review in Federal district court. The district court upheld the Secretary's decision and the claimant appealed
to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 



On appeal, the claimant argued that illegal activity undertaken to support a drug addiction cannot constitute SGA;
that assuming such activity can constitute SGA, the Secretary's finding of SGA in his case was unsupported by substantial
evidence; and that if illegal activity to support a drug habit can be considered SGA, then the Secretary, in determining
SGA, was required to deduct the cost of the narcotics from the claimant's income as an impairment-related work expense.
Additionally, the claimant contended that using illegal activity as a basis for finding SGA denied him due process
and equal protection of the law. 



The court of appeals found nothing in the Social Security Act (the Act) or the Secretary's implementing regulations
which requires SGA to be lawful. The court noted that under the regulations, work activity is substantial if it ``involves
doing significant physical or mental activity'' and is gainful if it is ``the kind of work usually done for pay or profit,
whether or not a profit is realized.'' The court stated that these considerations ``apply with almost equal ease irrespective
of the legality of the activities involved,'' and that, therefore, ``[w]hether legally or illegally employed, the
regulations direct an ALJ to focus on whether the claimant is performing significant physical or mental activities,
and doing so with the intent of earning money or making a profit.'' Finding that neither the Act nor the regulations
recognizes a distinction between lawful and unlawful activity for purposes of determining SGA, the court of appeals
concluded that illegal activity can constitute SGA. 



The court also determined that the claimant's uncontradicted testimony regarding the thievery in which he engaged
to support his $200-$300 per day drug habit provided substantial evidence to support the ALJ's finding that
the claimant was engaged in SGA. The court rejected the claimant's contention that the cost of narcotics must be deducted
from his income as an impairment-related work expense. The court noted that to be considered an impairment-related
work expense under the Secretary's regulations, a drug must ``reduce or eliminate'' the symptoms of a claimant's
impairment, or ``slow down its progression.'' Contrary to these criteria, the court found that in this case the claimant's
use of drugs was the basis of his alleged disability, and that his continued usage of drugs only exacerbated his medical
condition. The court also found the claimant's due process and equal protection arguments to be without merit. Accordingly,
the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the district court upholding the Secretary's decision denying the claimant's
application for disability benefits. 



Engel, Senior Circuit Judge

*

 







Harold Wayne Dotson, a Supplemental Security Income claimant, appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment
in favor of Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In granting summary judgment,
the district court upheld an administrative law judge's finding that Dotson was engaging in substantial gainful
activity by supporting a $200- to $300-per-day heroin and cocaine habit through illegal means. See 

Dotson 

v. 

Sullivan, 

813 F. Supp. 651 (C.D. Ill. 1992). Because we agree that illegal activity can constitute substantial gainful activity,
we affirm.

I. Background




Dotson applied for Supplemental Security Income benefits on September 25, 1989, alleging disability since 1968
due to asthma, multiple allergies, and past drug abuse. The Social Security Administration denied his application
on January 10, 1990, and again upon reconsideration on May 21, 1990. Dotson then requested and received a hearing before
an administrative law judge (``ALJ''). At the administrative hearing, Dotson testified that he uses $200 to $300
worth of heroin and cocaine each day. Additionally, he testified that he supports his drug habit by hustling. When
asked to define hustling, Dotson replied: ``steal, beg, whatever, you know.'' 


With regard to his begging, Dotson stated that he usually panhandles at the Warner Homes, which are located in a poor
neighborhood in Peoria, Illinois. As to Dotson's thievery, the following colloquy occurred during the administrative
hearing: 


Q. [By ALJ] Where do you steal at? 


A. [By Dotson] You can do that anywhere. Wherever we can find a place to. 


Q. Give me an idea. Give me some examples. 


A. The mall, downtown, wherever. You just ride and look and, you know. 


Q. How long do you spend riding and looking until you find a place to steal? 


A. As long as you have to. 


Q. Like how long? 


A. Sometime_ 


Q. All day long? 


A. Sometimes it takes all day. 


Q. What kinds of things have you stolen this month? 


A. This month? 


Q. Uh huh. 


A. I, well, I like to, I try to concentrate on saws. 


Q. On what? 


A. Saws. 


Q. Saws? 


A. You know, the chainsaws, the little bitty chainsaws? 


Q. Where do you find those at? 


A. Everywhere, everywhere. 


Q. And once you get them, what do you do with them? 


A. You sell them. 


Q. To who? 


A. A lot of people buy. 


Q. Well, where do you find_I wouldn't imagine there would be a lot of demand for them in Warner homes. 


A. No. 


Q. Where do you go to sell the chainsaws? 


A. Different businesses. 


Q. Like what? 


A. Small businesses. 



Q. Give me some examples. 


A. Like small stores or cleaners, different places like that. 


Q. Do you have to travel around to these places? How long does it take you to find somebody to buy a saw? 


A. Usually, they already, you have been_you kind of already know they probably want one. 


Q. So you have already canvassed these places earlier? You have gone out and_ 


A. No, you have probably sold them stuff and they can give you kind of an idea about what else they might like, you know.



Based on Dotson's testimony, the ALJ found that Dotson's stealing and panhandling constituted substantial gainful
activity (``SGA'') worth an average of approximately $5,600 per month and, accordingly, denied his claim for SSI
benefits. Specifically, the ALJ found that, due to the poor area in which Dotson panhandles, the bulk of his income
must come from illegal means. As to the nature of Dotson's criminal endeavors, the ALJ concluded: 






In order to steal he must ``case'' the area in which he has determined to steal the property. He must then plan on how he
is going to steal the property and then actually steal it. During the month in which the hearing was held the claimant
was stealing chainsaws. Lifting and carrying the chainsaws would also be significant 

physical

 activity. The planning and execution of the larceny entails significant 

mental

 activity. From these activities the claimant earns enough money to support his cocaine habit and provide him with
other money in substantial amounts exceeding $200 to $300 a day. [Emphasis in original.] 





On July 9, 1991, the Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ's decision. Dotson then filed the instant action against
the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (``Secretary'') in federal court. On July 1, 1992, with
cross-motions for summary judgment before it, the district court granted the Secretary's motion for summary affirmance
and entered a separate judgment against Dotson and in favor of the Secretary. See 

Dotson 

v. 

Sullivan, 

813 F. Supp. 651 (C.D. Ill. 1992). This appeal followed.

II. Discussion 

 

Dotson essentially raises four arguments. First, he believes that illegal activities undertaken solely to satisfy
a drug addiction cannot constitute SGA. Second, assuming that illegal activity can constitute SGA, Dotson claims
that the ALJ's finding of SGA in his case is unsupported by substantial evidence. Third, Dotson contends that if illegal
activity undertaken to support a drug habit can constitute SGA, then the Secretary is required to deduct the cost of
the narcotics from the claimant's income as an impairment-related work expense. Fourth and finally, Dotson believes
that using illegal activities to furnish the basis for finding SGA denies him due process and equal protection of the
laws under the United States Constitution. 

 

A. Overview 

 

The Social Security Act (``Act''), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.,

 provides for the payment of benefits to disabled persons. Title II of the Act governs the payment of Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (``OASDI'') benefits to disabled persons who have contributed to the Social Security program.
42 U.S.C. 401 

et seq.

 Title XVI of the Act, the title under which Dotson filed his application for benefits, provides for the payment of Supplemental
Security Income (``SSI'') benefits to disabled persons who are indigent. 42 U.S.C. 1382 

et seq.

; see generally 

Bowen

 v. 

Yuckert,

 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987). Both Titles II and XVI define disability as an ``inability to engage in any substantial gainful
activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in
death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months *
 9*
 9*.'' 42 U.S.C. 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A). 

 Pursuant to statutory authority, the Secretary has promulgated regulations establishing a five-step sequential
analysis for determining whether an SSI claimant is disabled. See 20 CFR 416.920; 

Sullivan

 v. 

Zebley,

 493 U.S. 521, 525 (1990).
 The first step of the process, and the only one relevant for purposes of this appeal, requires the Secretary to determine
whether the claimant is engaging in SGA. See 20 CFR 416.920(a). A finding of SGA means that the claimant is ineligible
for SSI benefits. 

Id.

 at  416.920(b); 

Yuckert,

 482 U.S. at 140. In this case, because the ALJ found that Dotson's stealing and panhandling constituted SGA, he denied
Dotson's claim for benefits without moving to the next step in the sequential analysis.
 






B. Illegal Activity as SGA 

 

Our research reveals that we are the first appellate court to address the issue of whether illegal activity can support
a finding of SGA. The handful of federal trial courts faced with this question, including the district court below,
have answered unanimously in the affirmative.
 Because the ALJ and district court's determination that illegal activity can constitute SGA is a construction of
the Secretary's regulations, we review this decision of law 

de novo.

 See 

Johnson

 v. 

Sullivan,

 922 F.2d 346, 356 (7th Cir. 1990). 





As the definition of disability quoted above indicates, the inability to engage in SGA is a statutory prerequisite
to obtaining either SSI or OASDI benefits. Nonetheless, Congress delegated to the Secretary the responsibility
for defining SGA. 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(D) (Title XVI). In response to the Act's mandate, and as the components of
the term suggest, the Secretary has defined SGA as ``work activity that is both substantial and gainful.'' See 20 CFR
416.972. Work activity is substantial if it ``involves doing significant physical or mental activities.'' 

Id.

 at  416.972(a). Work activity is gainful if it is ``the kind of work usually done for pay or profit, whether or
not a profit is realized.'' 

Id.

 at  416.972(b); see generally 

Callaghan

 v. 

Shalala,

 992 F.2d 692 (7th Cir. 1993) (discussing elements of SGA).
 Activities such as taking care of one's self, performing household tasks, engaging in hobbies or therapy, and attending
school, clubs, or social programs generally do not constitute SGA. 20 CFR 416.972(c).

<TEXT>
 

The foregoing framework underscores the dual nature of an ALJ's inquiry into whether a claimant is engaging in SGA.
Under the substantiality prong of the analysis, an ALJ considers the nature of the undertakings comprising the claimant's
work activity. Thus, the degree to which a claimant's work requires the use of ``expertise, skills, supervision and
responsibilities'' becomes relevant in determining whether that work constitutes SGA. See 20 CFR 416.973(a). Additionally,
an ALJ will consider how well a claimant performs his or her work activities:

 


 
If you do your work satisfactorily, this may show that you are working at the substantial gainful activity level. If
you are unable, because of your impairments, to do ordinary or simple tasks satisfactorily without more supervision
or assistance than is usually given other people doing similar work, this may show that you are not working at the substantial
gainful activity level. If you are doing work that involves minimal duties that make little or no demands on you and
that are of little or no use to your employer, or to the operation of a business if you are self-employed, this does not
show that you are working at the substantial gainful activity level.

 


 


Id.

 at  416.973(b). 


 

In evaluating the gainfulness of a claimant's work, an ALJ's inquiry is more circumscribed. Here, as noted above,
the claimant's undertakings need be only of the type that normally result in pay or profit. In other words, a claimant
can be found to be engaging in SGA without earning any income. See 

Callaghan,

 992 F.2d at 695-96 (unprofitable business owner was engaging in SGA).

5

 This is not to say that a claimant's earnings are irrelevant for purposes of determining whether he or she is engaging
in SGA. See, e.g., 20 CFR 416.974(a)(1). To the contrary, a claimant who earns on average less than $300 per month is
presumed not to be engaging in SGA, while a claimant who makes more than an average of $500 per month is presumptively
ineligible for SSI benefits. 

Id.

 at   416.974(b)(3)(vii), (b)(2)(vii).

6

 As with most legal presumptions, however, these income guidelines are rebuttable and ``do not relieve an ALJ of the
duty to develop the record fully and fairly.'' 

Dugan

 v. 

Sullivan,

 957 F.2d 1384, 1390 (7th Cir. 1992) (citations and internal quotations omitted). 






Against this background, Dotson concedes_as he must_that in at least some instances illegal activity can be substantial
gainful activity. Dotson continues, however, that the context in which his thievery occurs precludes its use in determining
whether he has been engaging in SGA. In his own words:

 


 
A drastic distinction exists between a person who is engaged in illegal activity for effectively the equivalent of
a legal career such as being a drug dealer, illegal drug importer or other illegal activity which has counterparts
in lawful activities such as business managers, business owners and the like, and a thief who steals merely to feed
the cravings of unquenchable drug addiction.

 


 
Aplnt's. Br. at 18. Considering Dotson's claim under the scheme set forth above, we conclude that he forwards a distinction
without a difference.

Admittedly, even a cursory examination of the regulations reveals that the Secretary envisioned their application
within a traditional employment context. Importantly, however, nothing in the Act or its regulations specifically
requires SGA to be lawful. This silence, we believe, suggests that illegal activities can constitute SGA. The inference
is strengthened, moreover, when considering that the relevant considerations noted above apply with almost equal
ease irrespective of the legality of the activities involved. Thus, one can envision a number of illegal activities
that might not rise to the level of SGA.

7

 Whether legally or illegally employed, the regulations direct an ALJ to focus on whether the claimant is performing
significant physical or mental activities, and doing so with the intent of earning money or making a profit. 





Moreover, it must be remembered that an ALJ performs the SGA analysis as one of five steps used to determine whether
a person is disabled and, consequently, unable to function within our economy. A claimant who can manage through illegal
means is just as undeserving of benefits as a claimant who can survive without violating the law. For this reason, there
is no difference between the addict who spends all of his lawfully derived earnings on narcotics and the one who illegally
obtains, and then exhausts, her income. Both are fueled, to quote Dotson, by the ``cravings of unquenchable drug addiction.''
The only real distinction between the two_the lawfulness of their income_finds no cognizance under the Act and its
interpretive regulations.

8

 







Finally, our conclusion that illegal activity can constitute SGA derives substantial support from the well-established
tax principle that unlawful earnings come within the meaning of the term ``gross income'' and are thus taxable. See,


e.g., James 

v. 

United States,

 366 U.S. 213, 218 (1961) (plurality opinion of Warren, C.J.), 

overruling Commissioner 

v. 

Wilcox,

 327 U.S. 404 (1946); 

United States 

v. 

Sullivan,

 274 U.S. 259, 263 (1927). Notably, the Act has adopted the tax code's definition of gross income for purposes of determining
whether a SSI claimant's income is sufficiently high so as to render him or her ineligible for benefits. 42 U.S.C. 1382(d);
see also 20 CFR 416.1110(b).

9

 Indeed, one of the concerns motivating the plurality in 

James, 

``to remove the incongruity of having the gains of the honest laborer taxed and the gains of the dishonest immune,''
366 U.S. at 218, provides the crux of our reasoning in this case. 






C. Sufficiency of the Evidence 




Having concluded that illegal activity can constitute SGA, we must next determine whether the ALJ properly applied
the legal standard in Dotson's case. Our inquiry is a limited one. We will not decide facts anew, reweigh evidence,
or substitute our judgment for the Secretary's. 

Schroeter 

v. 

Sullivan, 

977 F.2d 391, 394 (7th Cir. 1992). Rather, we look to see whether ``substantial evidence'' supports the ALJ's findings.
See 42 U.S.C. 1383(c)(3) (citing 42 U.S.C. 405(g)). Substantial evidence is ``such relevant evidence as a reasonable
mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.'' 

Richardson 

v. 

Perales,

 402 U.S. 389, 402 (1977). 


Dotson first contends that the ALJ had before him no evidence of specific illegal acts which could support a finding
of SGA. Secondly, he believes the ALJ erroneously assumed that he paid full street-value for the narcotics he used
and, thus, overestimated the amount of income needed to support his drug habit. We address each claim in order.

10

 






Dotson's first claim, that the record lacks any evidence of illegal activities, is belied by his own testimony and
by the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom by the ALJ. For example, when the ALJ asked Dotson to describe what types
of items he had stolen in the month during which the administrative hearing was held, Dotson replied: ``I try to concentrate
on saws.  * * *  You know, the chainsaws, the little bitty chainsaws.'' Dotson then went
on to explain, in some detail, how he would sell the stolen items. Additionally, the ALJ made at least one specific inquiry
into the substantiality of Dotson's activities, asking him how long it takes him to find a place to steal. 


We grant to Dotson his point that the record contains no evidence concerning any specific act of thievery. Also, we
agree with him that the ALJ could have more fully developed the record as to the nature of his criminal undertakings.
Nevertheless, we cannot say that the record before us contains less than substantial evidence that Dotson's thievery
required the significant use of his physical and mental skills, and that those skills were applied within a context
designed to produce pay or profit. See 20 CFR 416.972 (a), (b). In short, Dotson's testimony allowed the ALJ to reasonably
conclude that the effort required to steal the chainsaws with regularity constituted SGA, and we therefore uphold
this aspect of the ALJ's decision. A more exacting inquiry, while desirable, was not required.

Dotson's second argument, that the ALJ overestimated the cost of the narcotics, is also unpersuasive. As an initial
matter, this claim suffers from the same weakness that proved fatal to his first argument, that is, Dotson testified
without contradiction to using $200 to $300 worth of heroin and cocaine daily.

11

 If Dotson actually paid less for his narcotics, one would have expected him to testify accordingly. Furthermore,
this case is unlike 

Curtis 

v. 

Sullivan,

 764 F. Supp. 119 (N.D. Ill. 1991), where the ALJ simply imputed to the claimant an income sufficient to satisfy his addiction.
In that case, the ALJ concluded, in the absence of evidence as to legal or illegal employment, that the claimant had
to be engaging in SGA in order to support his expensive drug habit. Here, on the other hand, Dotson's testimony as to
his thievery filled the gap. From this, the ALJ was justified in finding that Dotson's earnings surpassed $500 per
month, thereby rendering him presumptively ineligible for SSI benefits. See 20 CFR 416.974(b)(2)(vii). 






We agree with the court in 

Curtis 

that simply because a claimant has a severe and expensive drug habit does not mean that the person is engaging in SGA
to support it. 764 F. Supp. at 120-21. The record must contain substantial evidence, of the type outlined in Section
II(B), 

supra

, that the claimant is engaging in legal or illegal activities that are substantial and gainful. Because we have held
that the ALJ's decision in this case comports with those requirements, we reject Dotson's challenge to the evidence
supporting the Secretary's decision. 




D. Narcotics as an Impairment-Related Work Expense 




Dotson next raises the interesting yet ultimately unavailing argument that, if illegal activities undertaken to
maintain a drug habit can constitute SGA, then the cost of the narcotics must be deducted from income as an impairment-related
work expense (``IRWE'') under 42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)(4)(B)(ii) and its interpretive regulations, 20 CFR 416.976. As
we discuss below, Dotson misapprehends the nature of IRWEs. 


42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)(4)(B)(ii), enacted as part of the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980, Public Law No.
96-265, 94 Stat. 441 (1980), provides: 





In determining the income of an individual (and his eligible spouse) there shall be excluded * * * if
such individual (or such spouse) is disabled but not blind (and has not attained age 65, or received benefits under
this subchapter (or aid under a State plan approved under section 1352 or 1382 of this title) for the month before the
month in which he attained age 65) * * * such additional amounts of earned income of such individual,
if such individual's disability is sufficiently severe to result in a functional limitation requiring assistance
in order for him to work, as may be necessary to pay the costs (to such individual) of attendant care services, medical
devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (not including routine drugs or routine medical
services unless such drugs or services are necessary for the control of the disabling condition) which are necessary
(as determined by the Secretary in regulations) for that purpose, whether or not such assistance is also needed to
enable him to carry out his normal daily functions, except that the amounts to be excluded shall be subject to such reasonable
limits as the Secretary may prescribe. 






See also 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(D) (restating same). In 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated
20 CFR 416.976. See 48 FR 21940 (1983). These regulations established a five-part test for determining the deductibility
of an IRWE: 





We will deduct impairment-related work expenses if_


(1) You are otherwise disabled * * *; 


(2) The severity of your impairment(s) requires you to purchase (or rent) certain items and services in order to work;



(3) You pay the cost of the item or service * * *; 


(4) You pay for the item or service in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and 


(5) Your payment is in cash (including checks and other forms of money). Payment in kind is not deductible. 






20 CFR 416.976(b). With respect to the deductibility of drugs as an IRWE, the regulations provide:

 



If you must use drugs * * * to control your impairment(s), the payments you make for them may be deducted.
The drugs or services must be prescribed (or utilized) to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of your impairment(s) or
to slow down its progression. 




* * * * *




Examples of deductible drugs * * * are anticonvulsant drugs to control epilepsy * * *;
antidepressant medication for mental disorders; medication used to allay the side effects of certain treatments;* * *
and immunosuppressive medications that kidney transplant patients regularly take to protect against graft rejection.






20 CFR 416.976(c)(5)(i), (ii). Consistent with the Act's objective, use of the drugs must be necessary to allow the
person to perform work. See Soc. Sec. R. 84-26 at 18 (1984) (``Routine drugs * * * are `needed'
when they are required to control the disabling condition, thereby enabling the individual to function at work.'').

Dotson argues that, due to the severity of his drug addiction, he needs the cocaine and heroin in order for him to steal
and panhandle. (Of course, he steals and panhandles so that he can purchase more cocaine and heroin, so that he can continue
to steal and panhandle_and thus the cycle of addiction continues.) Because he needs the narcotics in order to engage
in SGA, Dotson continues, he believes that the cost of the cocaine and heroin should be deducted from his earnings as
an IRWE.

Sadly, we have no reason to disbelieve Dotson's self-characterization. Unfortunately for him, however, the regulations
comprehend more than mere addiction to a substance before the cost of that substance will be considered an IRWE. As
the statute and regulations reveal, a number of obstacles lie in the path of Dotson's argument. We content ourselves,
however, to focus upon the requirement that in order to be an IRWE a drug must ``reduce or eliminate'' the symptoms of
a claimant's impairment, or ``slow down its progression.'' 20 CFR 416.976(c)(5)(i). In the face of Dotson's claim
that his disability stems from drug abuse, he cannot hope to maintain the argument that his continued use of heroin
and cocaine reduces or eliminates the symptoms of his impairment. Rather, Dotson's use of drugs serves as the basis
of his alleged disability. And far from slowing Dotson's dependency upon narcotics, his continued use of heroin and
cocaine only exacerbates his disability. With these considerations in mind, we must reject Dotson's claim for an
IRWE. 



E. The Constitutional Claims



Dotson lastly argues that using illegal activity to constitute SGA violates his rights to due process and equal protection
of the laws under the United States Constitution, although he has encountered some difficulty in articulating the
precise nature of his constitutional complaints. It would seem that his due process argument_one which might be more
properly construed as an administrative challenge to the regulations_reduces to the theory that the ALJ's decision
in this case attempts to override Congress' intent to provide SSI benefits to substance abusers and, therefore, is
void for want of a rational basis. His equal protection claim, on the other hand, appears based on the assertion that,
under the Secretary's position, rich drug addicts will be treated preferentially to the disadvantage of poor ones.
We briefly address each of his arguments. 



1. Due Process



To establish a due process violation, Dotson faces the well-settled and formidable burden of proving that the Secretary's
regulations, as we have interpreted them, lack a rational basis. See, 

e.g., Weinberger 

v. 

Salfi, 

422 U.S. 749, 768 (1975) (``the Due Process Clause can be thought to interpose a bar only if the statute [or, as here,
a regulation] manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification [citation
omitted]''). Moreover, that rational basis need not be expressed explicitly by Congress or the administrative agency;
``any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.'' 

Dandridge 

v. 

Williams, 

397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970) (citation omitted).

Initially, we note that interpreting the Secretary's regulations as allowing illegal activity to constitute SGA
does not interfere with Congress' intent, assuming there is one, to provide disability benefits to substance abusers.

12

 Rather, such an interpretation prevents only those substance abusers who are engaging in SGA, whether legally or
illegally employed, from receiving SSI benefits reserved for disabled persons who are also poor. See 

Bowen 

v. 

Yuckert, 

482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987) (``Title XVI of the Act provides for the payment of disability benefits to indigent persons
* * *.'' [Emphasis added.]) Thus, the Secretary's regulations coincide with the SSI program's underlying
purpose.





Moving to the next level, Dotson's myopic view of Congress' intent in the statutory context serves to highlight the
flaw in his constitutional argument. Simply put, we cannot say that regulations which preclude the disbursement
of federal disability benefits to persons who are engaging in substantial and gainful activity, regardless of the
activity's legality, constitutes a ``patently arbitrary classification'' warranting judicial intervention.
To the contrary, working within a system where the limited supply of federal funds will never satisfy the deserving
demand, we are hard pressed to think of a better dividing line than the one drawn by the Secretary. Having said this much,
we must reject Dotson's due process claim.



2. Equal Protection



Dotson faces an equally difficult burden when arguing to this court that the Secretary's regulations violate the
equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. Because a statute's or regulation's differential impact upon
the poor versus the wealthy, by itself, does not subject that distinction to strict judicial scrutiny, see, 

e.g., Kadrmas 

v. 

Dickinson Public Schools, 

487 U.S. 450, 458 (1988), Dotson must prove that the classification drawn by the Secretary's regulations fails to
rationally further a legitimate interest, 

Zobel 

v. 

Williams, 

457 U.S. 55, 60 (1982). Under such a standard, Dotson's constitutional claim again must fail.

Dotson argues that the Secretary's position, if implemented, will hurt only poor drug abusers because rich ones,
who presumably will have paid into the Social Security system, will be eligible to receive OASDI benefits under Title
II of the Act. This argument misses the mark for the simple reason that OASDI claimants, just like SSI claimants, must
navigate the same five-step administrative process, the first of which requires that the claimant not be engaging
in SGA. Compare 42 U.S.C. 423(d)(1)(A) and 20 CFR  404.1520(a) (Title II) with 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(A) and
20 CFR  416.920(a) (title XVI).

13

 Even if Dotson could maintain such an argument, we would be inclined to reject it because the Secretary's classification
seems rationally to further the legitimate interest of rewarding those persons with a prior attachment to the work
force who have contributed to the Social Security system.





The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

<DOCTITLE>Agreement on Social Security Between the United States and Luxembourg; Entry Into Force </DOCTITLE>


The Commissioner of Social Security gives notice that an agreement coordinating the United States (U.S.) and Luxembourg
social security systems entered into force on November 1, 1993. The agreement with Luxembourg, which was signed on
February 12, 1992, is similar to U.S. social security agreements already in force with fifteen other countries_Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Agreements of this type are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security
Act. 
Like the other agreements, the U.S.-Luxembourg agreement eliminates dual social security coverage_the situation
that occurs when a person from one country works in the other country and is required, along with his employer, to pay
social security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Under the U.S.-Luxembourg agreement, a worker who is
sent by an employer in the U.S. to work in Luxembourg for 5 years or less remains covered only by the U.S. system. The agreement
includes additional rules that eliminate dual U.S. and Luxembourg coverage in other work situations. 
The agreement also helps eliminate situations where workers suffer a loss of benefit rights because they have divided
their careers between the two countries. Under the agreement, workers may qualify for partial U.S. or Luxembourg
benefits based on combined (totalized) work credits from both countries. 
Individuals who wish to obtain copies of the agreement or want more information about its provisions may write to the
Social Security Administration, Office of International Policy, Post Office Box 17741, Baltimore, Maryland 21235.

 Notice of social security ruling.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling
94-2p. This Policy Interpretation Ruling clarifies the Social Security Administration's (SSA) longstanding
policy that, under the supplemental security income program, any portion of a workers' compensation (WC) payment
designated by the authorizing or paying agency for medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable
to obtaining the WC award is not income. These expenses may be past, current, or future.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1).


Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,
disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based
on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations.
Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases. 
If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect.

Policy Interpretation Ruling


Title XVI: Workers' Compensation (WC) Payments 





Purpose:

 To clarify that, under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, any portion of a WC payment designated for
medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable to obtaining the WC award is not income. 


Citations (Authority):

 Section 1612(a)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (SSACT), as amended; Regulations No. 16, sections 416.1103(a),
416.1121(a), and 416.1123(b)(3) 


Pertinent History: 

WC is awarded to an injured employee or to the survivor(s) of an employee under Federal and State WC programs and the
Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act. It may be paid by a Federal or State agency, an insurance company, or an employer.
Payments may include amounts for medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable to obtaining the WC
award. These expenses may be past, current, or future and may be lump-sum or periodic in nature.
The SSACT at section 1612(a)(2)(B), and regulations at 
20 CFR 416.1121(a) provide that WC is unearned income for SSI purposes. Regulations at 20 CFR 416.1123(b)(3) provide
for counting less than the amount actually received when part of the amount received is for an expense of obtaining
the income. Regulations at 20 CFR 416.1103(a) provide that reimbursement for certain medical expenses is not income.



Policy Interpretation:

 If the Federal or State agency, insurance company, or employer that authorizes or makes a WC payment designates any
portion of it for medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable to obtaining the WC award, such portion
is not income for SSI purposes. The expenses may be past, current, or future. Any portion of a WC award or payment not
designated for such expenses is unearned income. 


Effective Date:

 This Ruling merely clarifies longstanding SSI policy on the treatment of WC payments designated for certain types
of expenses. If a case comes to SSA's attention where SSA did not apply this policy, SSA will reopen and revise the earliest
determination possible under the rules of administrative finality. SSA will use the 2-year reopening rule, treating
the determination as an error on the face of the evidence.

State and Local Fair Housing Laws: Initial Determination Concerning Substantial Equivalency of Fair Housing Law
of the State of Arizona 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice and request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c) of the Department's regulations, this notice announces the Department's determination
that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona is substantially equivalent, on its face, to the Fair Housing Act.
This notice solicits comments from the public on this determination, and on the proposed determination that the present
practices and past performance of the agency enforcing the fair housing law of the State of Arizona demonstrate that,
in operation, the law provides rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to those available under the
Fair Housing Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-3619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging
discrimination in housing. (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988 is cited as the ``Fair Housing Act.'') Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer
complaints to State and local agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined
and certified by the Department. The 
standards and procedures for certifying State and local fair housing laws that provide substantive rights and remedies
for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing
Act are set forth in 24 CFR part 115. 
On July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39561), the Department published the annual notice required by 24 CFR 115.6, which announced,
among other things, the updated, consolidated list of all certified agencies, and a list of agencies with which an
agreement for interim referrals or other utilization of services had been entered into under 24 CFR 115.11. In the
July 23, 1993 notice, the Department listed thirty-four jurisdictions, of which the State of Arizona was one, which
had entered into an agreement with the Department, subsequent to September 12, 1988, for interim referrals, and were
considered to have interim certification in accordance with section 810(f)(4) of the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988 (hereafter ``Act''). (The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was enacted on September 13, 1988.) 


Notice Announcements and Solicitation of Comments 


In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c)(1), this notice announces that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona has been
determined by the Assistant Secretary of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to be substantially equivalent, on its
face, to the Fair Housing Act. The Assistant Secretary has determined, after 
application of the criteria set forth in 24 CFR 115.3 and 115.4, that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona provides,
on its face, substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially
equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act. 
Following a review of performance standards and other materials pertaining to the fair housing law of the State of
Arizona, and its enforcement by the State of Arizona, the Department expects to make a final determination that the
law, in operation, provides rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to those available under the Fair
Housing Act. The Department intends to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the agency charged with enforcement
of the fair housing law of the State of Arizona in accordance with  115.6(c). 
In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(b), the public is invited to submit written comments on this notice. Specifically,
the Department requests written comments on the proposed determination that the current practices and past performance
of the agency of the State of Arizona charged with administration and enforcement of the State's fair housing law demonstrate
that, in operation, the State law provides substantive rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to
the Fair Housing Act. This notice also 
invites comments from the public on the Department's determination that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona
is substantially equivalent, on its face, to the Fair Housing Act.

(7) Increasing the availability of liability insurance for owners of rental housing and certified contractors and
establishing alternative systems to compensate victims of lead-based paint poisoning; and 
(8) Evaluating the utility and appropriateness of requiring both risk assessments or inspections and notification
to prospective lessees of rental housing.

<ACTION>

 Notice of institution of investigation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, P.L. 103-182, directs the Commission to monitor
imports of fresh or chilled peppers, other than chili peppers (HTS subheading 0709.60.00), until January 1, 2009,
as if a proper request for such monitoring had been made under section 202(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252(d)),
for purposes of expediting an investigation concerning provisional relief under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974.
As a result, the Commission instituted investigation No. 332-351, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of
1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(g)), for the purpose of monitoring imports of fresh or chilled peppers. 


In the course of the investigation, the Commission will monitor U.S. imports of fresh or chilled peppers from all foreign
suppliers. In addition, the Commission will investigate and gather data, to the extent possible, on U.S. growers
in such areas as shipments, prices, market share, employment levels, profit-or-loss, and efforts to compete. Wherever
possible, the Commission will rely on existing data from other government agencies. 
Although section 316 does not require that the Commission publish reports summarizing the information obtained
as a result of such monitoring, the Commission plans to publish statistical annual reports of certain trade data through
the year 2008.

<DOCTITLE>Saccharin From China and Korea </DOCTITLE>



Determinations 



On the basis of the record

1

 developed in the subject investigations, the Commission unanimously determines, pursuant to section 733(a) of
the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)), that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States
is materially injured by reason of imports from China and Korea of saccharin, provided for in subheading 2925.11.00
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than
fair value (LTFV). 





Background 



On November 18, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by PMC Specialties Group,
Cincinnati, OH, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of LTFV imports of saccharin
from China and Korea. Accordingly, effective November 18, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigations
Nos. 731-TA-675 and 676 (Preliminary). 

Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62682). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on December 9, 1993, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.



The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on January 3,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2716 (January 1994), entitled ``Saccharin from
China and Korea: Investigations Nos. 675 and 676 (Preliminary).'' 





Issued: January 3, 1994.





By order of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Tape Dispensers; Decision Not To Review an Initial Determination Granting Motion To Amend Notice of Investigation
To Clarify Identity of One Respondent and To Delete Another Respondent </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. International Trade Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative
law judge's (ALJ) initial determination (ID) in the above-captioned investigation granting complainant Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing, Inc.'s (``3M'') motion to amend the notice of investigation to correct the identification
of one respondent and to delete another respondent. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of violations of section 337 of the Tariff
Act of 1930 in the importation and sale of certain tape dispensers, on July 15, 1993. Complainant 3M alleges infringement
of U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180. 



On November 29, 1993, complainant filed a second motion to amend the notice of investigation to clarify the identity
of the named respondents. Complainant moved to delete one respondent, Shiang Shin Trading Co., and to change the identification
of another respondent, Safina Office Products, to Shiang Shin International, Inc., d/b/a Safina Office Products.
In requesting this action, 3M stated that an affidavit received from one of the respondents had revealed that Safina
Office Products is merely the assumed name for Shiang Shin International, Inc. and that Shiang Shin Trading Co. is
an unrelated company that is not involved in the importation or sale of the subject tape dispensers. The Commission
investigative attorney supported the motion. On December 13, 1993, the ALJ issued an ID (Order No. 4) granting complainant's
motion. 

This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337, and Commission interim
rule 210.53(h), 19 CFR 210.53(h). 

Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are available
for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International
Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202-205-2000. Hearing-impaired
individuals are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal
at (202) 205-1810. 




Issued: January 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Monitoring of U.S. Imports of Tomatoes </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of institution of investigation. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law 103-182, directs the Commission to
monitor imports of fresh or chilled tomatoes (HTS heading 0702.00), until January 1, 2009, as if a proper request for
such monitoring had been made under section 202(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252(d)), for purposes of expediting
an investigation concerning provisional relief under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974. As a result, the Commission
instituted investigation No. 332-350, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(g)), for
the purpose of monitoring imports of fresh or chilled tomatoes. 



In the course of the investigation, the Commission will monitor U.S. imports of fresh or chilled tomatoes from all
foreign suppliers. In addition, the Commission will investigate and gather data, to the extent possible, on U.S.
growers in such areas as shipments, prices, market share, employment levels, profit-or-loss, and efforts to compete.
Wherever possible, the Commission will rely on existing data from other government agencies. 

Although section 316 does not require that the Commission publish reports summarizing the information obtained
as a result of such monitoring, the Commission plans to publish annual statistical reports of certain trade data through
the year 2008.

<DOCTITLE>City of Los Angeles and City of Long Beach_Acquisition Exemption_Rail Lines of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway
Co., Southern Pacific Transportation Co., and Union Pacific Railroad Co.; Notice of Exemption</DOCTITLE>



The City of Los Angeles, acting by and through the Board of Harbor Commissioners of the Port of Los Angeles, and the City
of Long Beach, acting by and through its Board of Harbor Commissioners (collectively referred to as the Cities), have
jointly filed a notice of exemption to acquire from The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe), Southern
Pacific Transportation Company (SPT), and Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) certain interest in property described
below to construct a railroad corridor that will permit consolidation of Santa Fe's, SPT's, and UP's overhead rail
service to and from the ports to a point in central Los Angeles. The exemption became effective on December 24, 1993.

The lines being acquired, by subdivision, include the following: (a) Santa Fe's line on the Los Angeles Harbor Subdivision
between milepost 27.6 and milepost 28.3 in the County of Los Angeles; and the connection track between SPT's San Pedro
Branch and Santa Fe's Watson Yard; (b) SPT's line from the connection with UP switch at the east side of Santa Fe Avenue
easterly of ``J'' Yard, milepost BG 486.17 (San Pedro Branch) southeasterly through ``J'' Yard and a portion of the
SPT's Santa Monica Branch to a point of connection with the San Pedro Branch milepost BBM 484.99 (Wilmington Branch)
then southerly paralleling Alameda Street to a crossing of the Wilmington Branch at Dominguez Junction milepost
BG 496.50 (San Pedro Branch) crossing over to the Wilmington Branch southerly to a point southerly of Sepulveda Boulevard
and merging into the San Pedro Branch with the Wilmington Branch terminating at the Santa Fe's Harbor Subdivision
Thernard Crossing milepost BBM 501.20 (Wilmington Branch) and milepost BG 501.4 (San Pedro Branch) and the San Pedro
Branch continuing southerly and southeasterly through the Port of Los Angeles to approximately 22nd Street in San
Pedro and also including to the legs of the West Wye and the Long Beach Branch from the San Pedro Branch into the Port of
Long Beach and terminating south of the 8th Street Yard milepost BH 503.73 (Long Beach Branch); and (c) UP's line from
a connection with SPT's ``J'' Yard at the east side of Santa Fe Avenue in Los Angeles milepost 1.8 via Redondo Jct. and
Bridge Jct. to a connection with the East Bank main line at Ninth St. Jct. milepost 0.97; from Bridge Jct. on the aforesaid
line milepost 1.30 to Soto St. Jct. milepost 2.08 (a distance of approximately 500 feet); from Soto St. Jct. milepost
2.08 to Downey Road milepost 2.88; and from milepost 2.84 near Downey Road to Hobart Junction milepost 3.08 on the San
Pedro Branch north of Santa Fe's at-grade crossing; and the San Pedro Branch from milepost 21.71 to milepost 23.73
in the County of Los Angeles. 
Santa Fe, SPT, and UP are to retain trackage rights and/or permanent easements over those portions of property on which
they currently conduct rail operations so as to continue rail freight service. 
According to the Cities, their acquisition of the described property interests from Santa Fe, SPT, and UP will not
confer common carrier status on the Cities, and the Cities reserve their right to file a motion to dismiss this notice
or subsequently to seek revocation of the exemption. If we subsequently find that we lack jurisdiction over these
transactions, we will enter a supplemental order vacating this exemption.
Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: Samuel M. Sipe, Jr., Steptoe & Johnson, 1330 Connecticut
Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20036. 
This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is
void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction.




Decided: January 5, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Duke Power Co.; Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM-2503</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 4 to Material License No. SNM-2503
held by Duke Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Oconee Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation
(ISFSI), located on the Oconee Nuclear Station site, Oconee County, South Carolina. This amendment is effective
as of the date of issuance.


The amendment revises section 5.4.1 of the Technical Specification regarding the concrete density of Horizontal
Storage Module (HSM) from ``a minimum of 145 pounds per cubic foot'' to ``a minimum of 140 pounds per cubic foot.'' This
amendment does not affect fuel receipt, handling, and storage safety.


The application for this amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as
required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license
amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant
hazards consideration.


The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental
impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection
with issuance of the amendment.


For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendment dated March 9, 1993, as supplemented
by letter dated November 16, 1993; (2) Amendment No. 4 to Materials license No. SNM-2503; and (3) the Commission's
letter to the licensee dated January 5, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Permissible Forms of Margin Deposits 


January 4, 1994. 


On February 12, 1991, Delta Government Options Corp. (``Delta'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 relating to the acceptance of U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds as margin. On March 23, 1991, the Commission published
notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 to solicit comments from interested persons.
 One comment letter was received in response to which 
Delta amended its proposal on April 25, 1991.
 On September 8, 1993, Delta submitted a second amendment concerning the participation of registered investment
companies.
 As discussed below, the Commission is approving Delta's proposal as amended. 







I. Description 


Delta's proposal expands the permissible forms of margin by permitting participants to deposit not only Fed Funds
 but also U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining term to maturity of 365 days or less and Treasury securities which would
be deliverable by a participant if an option contract written by the participant was exercised and assigned to the
participant (i.e., ``cover).
 Treasury bills deposited as margin will be valued for purposes of determining the amount of margin on deposit with
Delta as 100% of the lesser of their par value or their market value. Deposits of Treasury bills as margin must be made
in principal amounts of $50,000 and integral multiples thereof. 





In the event that Treasury bills deposited as margin mature while on deposit with Delta, Delta will hold the cash proceeds
as margin and will invest them in accordance with its rules governing the investment of cash margin deposits.
 If a participant that is an employee benefit plan (i.e., pension plan) subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (``ERISA'')
 deposits Treasury bills as margin, Delta will monitor the maturity date of such Treasury bills and will require the
pension plan to substitute collateral prior to the maturity of the Treasury bills.

<TEXT>
 


II. Discussion



The Commission believes Delta's proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with sections 17A(b)(3) (A)
and (F) of the Act.

10

 Those sections require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which
are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.






Delta's proposal will provide flexibility to its participants by expanding the types of assets eligible to be deposited
as margin without exposing Delta to undue credit risk, market risk, or liquidation risk.

11

 Because Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, Delta is not subject to the
credit risk of the obligor.

12

 To reduce its exposure to market risk and liquidation risk, Delta will mark Treasury bills to market on a daily basis
and will value them at the lower of par or fair market value. Furthermore, because the market for Treasury bills is extremely
large and relatively liquid, Delta's liquidation risk is minimal.






The Commission also believes that Delta's proposal to accept cover as margin for short call option positions is appropriate.
As an initial matter, the Commission notes that The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''), another registered
clearing agency, accepts deposits of the security underlying a call option written by a participant in lieu of margin.

13

 The deposit of cover protects Delta to the maximum extent possible by fully collateralizing a participant's obligations
to Delta and by eliminating Delta's credit risk with respect to the depositing participant's short position. Accordingly,
the Commission believes that Delta's proposal to accept Treasury bills and cover as margin is consistent with its
obligation to safeguard the securities and funds for which it is responsible.





The Commission also believes that the special procedures for handling margin deposited by ERISA pension plan participants
is both necessary and appropriate. Until now, Delta's procedures for investing margin deposits and certain aspects
of ERISA have made participation in Delta impracticable for such plans. Under Delta's rules, Delta may invest the
cash margin received from participants in overnight repurchase agreements and pass the profits earned on such investments
back to participants.

14

 Under section 1002(21) of ERISA, a person could be deemed to be a plan fiduciary to the extent that such person exercises
discretionary authority over the assets of a plan.

15

 Accordingly, if Delta were to follow its usual investment procedures with respect to pension plan assets, Delta might
be deemed to be a plan fiduciary under ERISA. In light of these provisions, Delta has not permitted pension plans to
participate in its system.

16

 








On March 15, 1991, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the Department of Labor (``DOL'') granted an
exemption that permits ERISA pension plans to participate in Delta without Delta becoming a plan fiduciary provided
neither Delta nor any of its affiliates exercise discretionary authority or control with respect to the investment
of plan assets.

17

 To comply with the DOL exemption, Delta is implementing a procedure whereby pension plans will deposit substitute
collateral upon the maturity of Treasury bills deposited as margin in order that Delta is not viewed as exercising
discretionary authority or control with respect to the investment of any funds that are deemed to be plan assets.

18

 Delta's proposal appears to provide a reasonable method of permitting employee benefit plans that are subject to
ERISA to participate in Delta's system and thereby promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions without exposing Delta to potential ERISA liability.






The Commission notes that under the DOL exemption, Delta is permitted to liquidate certain assets of a defaulting
plan without being deemed to be exercising discretionary authority.

19

 Delta's risk exposure is reduced to the extent that it has the authority to liquidate such assets free of ERISA constraints.






III. Conclusion




For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DGOC-91-01)
is consistent with section 17A of the Act.




It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-DGOC-91-01) be, and hereby
is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Co.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Implementation
of a Deposit Automated Management Service</DOCTITLE>



January 4, 1994.



On August 16, 1993, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 a proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-93-9) to implement its Deposit Automated Management (``DAM'')
service. The Commission published notice of this proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register 

on October 1, 1993.
 No public comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
change.






I. Description



The proposed rule change establishes procedures for implementation of DTC's DAM service.
 DAM is an enhanced automated deposit service that enables DTC participants to send details of deposits to DTC in advance
of forwarding physical certificates.





Using DAM, a DTC participant will send to DTC advance Computer-to-Computer Facility (CCF/CCF II) or PTS transmissions
with details regarding securities that the participant plans to deposit. DTC then will determine whether the proposed
deposit is acceptable by reviewing for such things as ineligible issues, chilled issues, and incorrect CUSIPs. At
this point, DTC will send to the participant a PTS transmission which will flag rejected items (i.e., securities which
are unacceptable for deposit), items with record dates that affect DTC's processing,
 and other special processing items. The participant then will direct the printing of a special bar-coded deposit
ticket for all accepted items on a thermal bar-code printer.
 One bar-coded ticket will be printed for each CUSIP.
 Each bar-coded ticket will contain information such as the identity of the transfer agent, the nature of the deposit
(e.g., whether the deposit is made pursuant to a special corporate event or whether the shares are those of a limited
partnership), and other information that is required for DTC's internal processing of the deposit. After the participant
presents the physical certificates and the bar-coded deposit ticket to DTC, DTC will scan the bar-coded deposit ticket,
and the information contained therein immediately will update DTC's mainframe computer. This process eliminates
the need to enter data by keystroke.







Among other benefits, DAM will provide an opportunity for participants to consolidate deposits in the same issue
(whether or not the advanced deposit notifications are transmitted to DTC together) and will enable DTC to produce
a single deposit ticket for the total quantity of an issue deposited on a particular day.
 By providing a unique deposit control number that will be printed on the deposit ticket for each deposit, the service
will speed research, when needed, on the deposited item. DAM also will permit participants to suspend deposits for
up to ten business days in the event of an emergency, transportation delay, or error.

Participants that have a low volume of deposits and that do not want to purchase a bar-coded printer will be able to use
the PTS Deposit Automation Management Participant (``DAMP'') function to enter details of their intended deposits.
 The PTS DAMP function also can be used by CCF users to modify or delete deposit data already transmitted to DTC as well
as to enter additional deposit data.






By year-end 1993, DTC expects to have processed more than 4.5 million deposits comprised of approximately 17.5 million
certificates. The automation features of DAM will reduce DTC's costs and enhance DTC's efficiency in handling these
deposits. DTC will pass the savings that it will realize from DAM directly to participants by lowering deposit fees
as follows: (a) For deposits made under DAM, DTC will reduce the deposit charge by 40

$

 (29

$

 for legal deposits) from the applicable zone deposit charge for participants that print bar-coded tickets in their
office and (b) by 29

$

 (for deposits other than legal deposits) from the applicable zone deposit charge for participants that ask DTC to
print the bar-coded tickets. In addition, because DTC will prescreen the issues of securities that participants
intend to deposit, the new service will help participants save money by minimizing costly deposit rejects.




II. Discussion




The Commission believes that DTC's proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular with sections 17A (a)(1)(C)
and (b)(3)(F) thereunder.
 In section 17A(a)(1)(C) of the Act, Congress expressed its finding that new communications and data processing techniques
create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement. In this
regard, the Commission believes that DTC's DAM service facilitates the efficient, effective, and safe procedures
for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions by employing the electronic communication of information
between DTC and its participants.






Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to ensure the safeguarding of securities and funds that
are in the clearing agency's custody or control or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that by enabling
DTC to review proposed deposits before securities are delivered, the DAM service helps to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions in accordance with DTC's requirements under the Act.


Moreover, DTC's current safeguards will remain in place with the implementation of the DAM service. These safeguards
require DTC participants to take steps necessary to assure that the certificates presented to DTC are in good deliverable
and transferable form. As with current procedures, after the certificates are presented to DTC, DTC will send them
to the transfer agent who will reregister them in DTC's nominee name, Cede & Co. The certificates typically then
will be returned to DTC for safekeeping in its vault. On occasion, however, the transfer agent will reject a certificate
for reregistration.
 If a certificate is rejected, DTC will debit the depositing participant's securities account to the extent it was
credited when the securities were delivered to DTC. If the debit results in a short position, DTC will impose a charge
of 130% of market value until the short position is resolved.
 These safeguards, as they have in the past, will help to ensure that suspect securities or those with transfer restrictions
are excluded from DTC's system. Because the implementation of the DAM service will incorporate DTC's current safeguards,
the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with DTC's requirements under the Act.







III. Conclusion




On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular
with section 17A thereunder.




It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-93-9) be, and hereby is, approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Clearing Corp.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change to Reduce the Time
Frames for Processing Dividend Settlement Service Claims</DOCTITLE>



January 4, 1994.



On June 15, 1992, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') submitted a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MCC-92-06)
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on September 17, 1992, to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal.






I. Description of the Proposal



The purpose of the rule change is to expedite the settlement of claims for dividends or for registered bond interest
by shortening the time frames during which MCC requires delivery of Claim Forms by participants who are filing claims
against other participants. Under MCC's Dividend Settlement Service (``DSS''), MCC processes participants' claims
for dividends and registered bond interest. DDS procedures require that before a participant can submit a claim against
another participant, it must deliver to MCC a Notice of Intent. The Notice of Intent must include either documents
which establish the basis for the claim or a written explanation of the basis for the claim.

MCC rules require the claiming participant to deliver two copies of a Claim Form to the participant against whom the
claim is made. The Claim Form must now be delivered within five business days, previously within ten business days,
after delivering the Notice of Intent to MCC.
 Where the Notice of Intent is delivered six months or more after the record date of the dividend or interest claimed,
the Claim Form must now be delivered within ten business days, previously within twenty business days, after the delivery
of the Notice of Intent to MCC.
 Both the Notice of Intent and Claim Form must be delivered through the facilities of MCC.
 Once MCC receives the Notice of Intent and Claim Form, MCC distributes them to the participant against whom the claim
is made on the same day the Claim Form is received.







MCC's rules require the participant receiving the Claim Form to respond by the Charge Date, which appears on the Claim
Form. A participant who receives a Claim Form may honor it, may file an Intent Rejection with MCC, or may take no action.
If an Intent Rejection is filed, the participants may settle the matter themselves or may submit the matter to arbitration.
If the participant receiving the Claim Form honors the claim or fails to respond, MCC will debit that participant's
account and will credit the account of the claiming participant.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with section 17A of the Act.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of clearing agencies be designed to promote the prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 Moreover, in section 17A(a)(1) of the Act,
 Congress encourages the use of efficient and effective safe procedures for securities clearance and settlement.







The Commission believes that shortening the time frames for filing claim forms, from ten business days to five business
days and from twenty business days to ten business days, should result in more efficient and effective claim processing
at MCC. Shortening the time frames also should encourage participants to settle their claims and disputes involving
dividends and interest in a more prompt manner.



III. Conclusion



For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of
the Act, particularly section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.



It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-MCC-92-06) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to the Pricing of Open Orders</DOCTITLE>


January 6, 1994.


On September 23, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'')
 a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The proposal amends the NASD Rules of Fair Practice by requiring members holding open orders of securities quoted
ex-dividend, ex-rights, ex-distribution or ex-interest to adjust the price and, if necessary, the size of the order
by the amount of any dividend, payment or distribution on the day that the security is quoted ex-dividend, ex-rights,
ex-distribution or ex-interest.






Notice of the proposed rule change, together with the substance of the proposal, was provided by issuance of a Commission
release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33000, October 1, 1993) and by publication in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 53600, October 15, 1993). No comment letters were received. This order approves the proposed rule change.
The rule change approved herein amends Article III of the Rules of Fair Practice to require members holding open orders
of securities quoted ex-dividend, ex-rights, ex-distribution or ex-interest to adjust the price and, if necessary,
the size of the order by the amount of any dividend, payment or distribution on the day that the security is quoted ex-dividend,
ex-rights, ex-distribution or ex-interest. The rule change exempts from its scope: (1) Open orders subject to the
rules of a registered national securities exchange, (2) open stop orders to buy, and (3) open sell orders, as well as
orders marked ``do not reduce'' or ``do not increase.''
The NASD does not currently require its members to adjust open orders of securities quoted ex-dividend, ex-rights,
ex-distribution or ex-interest. An open order is an order to buy or sell which remains in effect until it is executed
or cancelled, or expires. Such orders are also known as ``good 'til cancelled,'' ``limit,'' or ``stop limit.''
 The NASD believes it is important to adopt a standard for business practices and ethics in dealing with customer open
orders. Because there is currently no NASD rule governing open orders, members adjust them according to their own
procedures unless the rules of another self-regulatory organization apply to the transaction (

e.g.,

 New York Stock Exchange Rule 118). These procedures can vary from automatic adjustment, automatic withdrawal, reconfirmation
of the order with the customer, or no action. Further, the procedures may vary among orders entered at the same firm
because the orders are routed to different firms for execution. As a result, investors may find that their open orders
are executed without adjustment after the ex-date at a higher cost per share than they intended based on their valuation
of the security. For example, an investor entering a limit order for a security at $10 per share prior to the dividend
date may have based his pricing judgment on the impending dividend declaration. If his order remains open after the
ex-dividend date, he may find his order in the money and executed at the dividend-assuming price even though he would
not be entitled to the dividend.




Moreover, the NASD believes the fact that some members adjust open orders on ex-dates while others do not, creates
confusion for customers. The NASD believes that the rule change sets forth a uniform and predictable method for adjusting
open orders, eliminates the potential unfairness associated with the failure to adjust these orders, and provides
consistency in the adjustment of open orders for NASD members that are also members of the New York Stock Exchange and
American Stock Exchange.
Subsection (a) of the new Rule of Fair Practice requires a member holding an open order from a customer or broker-dealer,
prior to executing or permitting the order to be executed, to adjust the price of the order by the amount of any dividend,
payment or other distribution on the ex-date.
Subsection (b) requires the member to reconfirm an open order prior to execution if the value of the distribution cannot
be determined. Subsection (c) requires open orders to be cancelled where the security is the subject of a reverse split.
Subsection (d) defines the term ``open order'' as an order to buy which remains in effect for a definite or indefinite
period of time until it is either executed, cancelled, or expires, including, but not limited to, orders marked ``good
'til cancelled,'' ``limit'' or ``stop limit.''
Finally, subsection (e) exempts: (1) Open orders subject to the rules of a registered national securities exchange,
(2) open stop orders to buy, and (3) open sell orders, as well as orders marked ``do not reduce'' or ``do not increase.''
Open stop orders to buy and open sell orders are exempted because the assumptions underlying such an order may not include
the value of an upcoming dividend; the combination of stop and limit prices in such an order makes the effect of repricing
unpredictable. Orders marked ``do not reduce'' or ``do not increase'' are the method for the customer to state that
he is aware of the implications of not adjusting the order on the ex-date.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires, 

inter alia,

 that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the creation of a single method
of handling the adjustment of open orders after the ex-date will serve the interest of investor protection. For this
reason, and for the reasons stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change satisfies the requirements
of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.






It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the instant rule change be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

Change Relating to the Codification of Basic Requirements Respecting Access to and Use of the OTC Bulletin Board Service</DOCTITLE>



January 5, 1994.



On October 12, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The proposal codifies the existing requirements respecting access to and use of the OTC Bulletin Board Service (``OTCBB'').






Notice of the proposed rule change, together with its terms of substance, appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on October 21, 1993.
 No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the rule change.





I. Description



The proposal codifies, without substantive change, various requirements that the NASD has implemented, pursuant
to Commission approval, since the OTCBB was launched as a pilot program on June 1, 1990. Specifically, these requirements
are included in the following Rule 19b-4 NASD filings approved by the Commission: (1) File No. SR-NASD-88-19
(as amended), detailing the basic operational requirements for the OTCBB;
 (2) File No. SR-NASD-90-37, expanding by one-half hour the quotation-update period applicable
to market makers in foreign/ADR issues;
 (3) File No. SR-NASD-91-12, establishing a firm quote requirement for all priced bids/offers in
domestic equity securities; and (4) File No. SR-NASD-91-38, establishing the parameters for an
inside bid-ask calculation.
 Additionally, the codification references two recently approved regulatory initiatives affecting the OTCBB and
participating member firms: (1) File No. SR-NASD-92-48, concerning real-time trade reporting
requirements for OTC equity securities;
 and (2) File No. SR-NASD-93-17, revising the minimum quotation size requirements for OTCBB market
makers.
 The present proposal provides that these initiatives will be published, respectively, in Part XIII of Schedule D
to the NASD By-Laws and Section 5 of Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws.









II. Discussion



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b) (6) and (11) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires, in pertinent part, that NASD rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts or
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(11) requires that the
rules of the NASD include provisions governing the form and content of quotations relating to securities sold otherwise
than on a national securities exchange and that those rules, among other things, be designed to promote orderly procedures
for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.

The Commission believes that, because the proposal embodies existing operational requirements that have been in
place but, until now, have not been codified as NASD rules, the proposal should facilitate NASD members' efforts to
research pertinent requirements by referencing a discrete section of the NASD Manual. Thus, the codification should
facilitate members' ability to comply with the requirements since they will be in a readily accessible form. Moreover,
the codification should promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing OTCBB quotations
since those procedures now will be found in the NASD Manual. In sum, the Commission believes the proposed codification
should facilitate the NASD's administration of and member firms' compliance with the operational requirements
that are unique to the OTCBB, thereby furthering the purposes of sections 15A(b) (6) and (11) and the Act in general.



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NASD-93-56) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby

Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The NYSE is herewith filing proposed amendments to NYSE Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 which will allow designated registered
investment advisers to vote proxies and receive proxy and related issuer material in lieu of beneficial owners. The
text of these rules follows:





Italics

 reflect additions



Proxies



(Rules and Policies Administered by Marketing Division.)




Applicability of proxy rules_Rules 450 to 460 [ 2450-2460], inclusive, apply to both listed and unlisted
securities, unless the context otherwise limits application.


The term ``unregistered company'' as used in Rule 456 to 459 [ 2456-2459] means a company not required
to conform to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the solicitation of proxies with respect
to its securities.


The term ``member'' as used in connection with Rules 456 to 459 [ 2456-2459] includes a member, allied
member, member firm, member corporation and employee thereof.




The term ``investment adviser'' as used in Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 [ 2450, 2451, 2452, 2465] may include a
registered broker-dealer.



Restriction on Giving of Proxies




Rule 450. No member organization shall give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote stock registered in its name,
or in the name of its nominee, except as required or permitted under the provisions of Rule 452 [ 2452], unless
such member organization is the beneficial owner of such stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing,


(1) 

Any member organization designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA
Plan that expressly grants discretion to the investment manager to manage, acquire, or dispose of any plan asset and
which has not expressly reserved the proxy voting right for the named fiduciary may vote the proxies in accordance
with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities; 

and


(2) any person registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment
discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and has been designated in writing by the beneficial
owner to vote the proxies for stock which is in the possession or control of the member organization, may vote such proxies.



Transmission of Proxy Material




Rule 451.(a) Whenever a person soliciting proxies shall furnish a member organization:


(1) copies of all soliciting material which such person is sending to registered holders and


(2) satisfactory assurance that he will reimburse such member organization for all out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable clerical expenses, incurred by such member organization in connection with such solicitation, 






Such member organization shall transmit to each beneficial owner of stock which is in its possession or control or
to an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion
pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner
of such stock to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner, 

the material furnished; and




(b) such member organization shall transmit with such material either:


(1) a request for voting instructions and, as to matters which may be voted without instructions under Rule 452 [ 2452],
a statement to the effect that, if such instructions are not received by the tenth day before the meeting, the proxy
may be given at discretion by the owner of record of the stock; provided, however, that such statement may be made only
when the proxy soliciting material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock 

or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner, 

at least fifteen days before the meeting. When the proxy soliciting material is transmitted to the beneficial owner
of the stock 

or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940


twenty-five days or more before the meeting, the statement accompanying such material shall be to the effect that
the proxy may be given fifteen days before the meeting at the discretion of the owner of record of the stock; or

or the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who
exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner,

 of the necessity for completing the proxy form and forwarding it to the person soliciting proxies in order that the
shares may be represented at the meeting. 
This rule shall not apply to beneficial owners outside the United States.

.10 Annual reports to be transmitted._The annual report shall be transmitted to beneficial owners 

or to beneficial owners' designated investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who

material under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
.60 Duty to transmit even when requested not to._The proxy material must be sent to a beneficial owner even though such
owner has instructed the member organization not to do so, 

unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to send such material to a designated
investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant
to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner. 


Rule 452 Giving Proxies by Member Organization

soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner

 and solicited voting instructions in accordance with the provisions of Rule 451 [ 2451], and which has not received
instructions from the beneficial owner 

or from such designated registered investment adviser

who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner,

 by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material, and 
(3) [No change in text] 


Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material 


Rule 465. A member organization, when so requested by a company, and upon being furnished with: 
(1) copies of interim reports of earnings or other material being sent to stockholders, and 
(2) satisfactory assurance that it will be reimbursed by such company for all out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable clerical expenses, shall transmit such reports or material to each beneficial owner of stock of such company
held by such member organization and registered in the name other than the name of the beneficial owner 

unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to transmit such reports or material
to a designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment
discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner. 


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose 


The purpose of the proposed rule amendments is to provide beneficial owners of stock with the ability to have investment
advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercise investment discretion for their account(s)
pursuant to an advisory contract and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owners to receive proxy
materials and to vote proxies on behalf of such beneficial owners. The proposed rule amendments will also allow the
designated registered investment advisers to receive annual reports and other related material. This would include
both member organizations of the NYSE and other entities registered as investment advisers. 
Currently, Exchange rules prohibit a member organization from voting proxies, on a discretionary basis, on securities
held in its custody unless the securities are beneficially owned by the member organization, the beneficial owner
has failed to provide the member organization with voting instructions and the subject of the vote is nonsubstantive,
or the member organization is the investment manager for an ERISA account. 
Further, Exchange rules require transmission of proxy and related issuer materials, as well as proxy voting instructions,
to each beneficial owner of stock held in the member organization's possession and control. Rule 451.60 explicitly
requires that proxy material be sent to a beneficial owner even though such owner has instructed the member organization
not to do so.

A number of member organizations and the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'')
represented to the Exchange that many of their customers who have their accounts managed by investment advisers do
not want to receive proxy related information and annual reports or vote the proxy. These member organizations have
indicated that their customers would rather have the professionals, whom they pay to manage their accounts, represent
their interests relative to the companies in which they own stock because the professionals are better qualified.


Also, banks, investment advisers and broker/dealers who are not subject to Exchange rules may receive proxy material
and vote proxies on behalf of their customers in accordance with fiduciary obligations set forth by contractual arrangement.


The amendments to Exchange Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 will permit investment advisers who exercise investment discretion
pursuant to an advisory contract and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owner, to receive proxy
soliciting materials, annual reports and other related material and to vote proxies in lieu of the beneficial owners
of securities. The term investment adviser is defiend to include a registered broker-dealer (e.g., 

a member organization).


The proposed rule change will not diminish a beneficial owner's rights to receive proxy related materials and to vote
proxies. Rather, it will give beneficial owners the option to designate their investment adviser as the person to
receive such materials and to vote proxies. In addition, it will enable member organizations to comply with customer
desires concerning transmission of proxy materials and voting proxies.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which requires
that the rules of the Exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to
protect the investing public, in that it establishes standards for investment advisers to receive proxy and related
material and to vote proxies, thereby meeting customer needs while providing appropriate regulatory safeguards.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others




The Exchange has neither solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments regarding this proposed rule change.
The Exchange has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 
(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 


IV. Solicitation of Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-93-37

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Options Clearing Corp.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Delivery-Versus-Payment Settlement Procedures</DOCTITLE>


January 4, 1994.


On September 17, 1992, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') submitted a proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-92-29)
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 concerning delivery-versus-payment (``DVP'') settlement procedures. Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 14, 1992, to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal.





I. Description of the Proposal


OCC is amending its Rule 1606A to modify its DVP settlement procedures. First, the proposal clarifies that a clearing
member that elects to settle using DVP procedures in Rule 1606A is not discharged from its obligation to U.S. dollars
or to deliver foreign currency in settlement of the exercise of foreign currency options until the earlier of the time
when (i) the clearing member's agent bank irrevocably pays U.S. dollars or delivers foreign currency to OCC's correspondent
bank on behalf of the clearing member of (ii) OCC's correspondent bank irrevocably credits OCC's account with the
U.S. dollars or the foreign currency deliverable by the clearing member's agent bank whether or not the clearing member's
agent bank has paid U.S. dollars or delivered foreign currency to OCC's correspondent bank. Second, the proposal
emphasizes the conditional nature of OCC's obligation in the DVP settlement process. OCC is obligated to cause its
correspondent bank to deliver the quantity of U.S. dollars or foreign currency payable by OCC only against receipt
from the agent bank of the quantity of U.S. dollars or foreign currency payable to OCC. Finally, the proposal clarifies
that OCC's delivery obligation is to the party designated in the DVP authorization, which may or may not be the clearing
member's agent bank.


II Discussion


The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular section 17A of the Act.
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act
 require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of funds in the custody or control of the clearing
agency or for which it is responsible.





The proposal clarifies certain DVP settlement procedures and describes with more precision when a clearing member
is discharged from its delivery and payment obligations in foreign currency options. It also clarifies OCC's payment
and delivery obligations in connection with DVP settlement. In particular, the proposal clarifies that OCC's obligation
arises only after the clearing member's agent bank fulfills its obligation to OCC's correspondent bank. The Commission
believes that this effort by OCC to clarify the terms of DVP settlement should add certainty to the settlement process
and should provide an added measure of protection for OCC. Because the rule change should further enable OCC to comply
with its statutory obligations to provide prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions
and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds, the Commission believes that approval of the rule change is
warranted.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of
the Act, particularly with section 17A of the Act,
 and the rules and regulations thereunder.






It is therefore ordered

, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-92-29) be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Notice. (This information is provided for planning purposes only, and is not a solicitation for proposals)






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice describes three projects to be conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
in FY94, under its Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program, to provide planning and initial implementation
assistance for manufacturing extension programs. These projects correspond to the State Technology Extension
Program (STEP) component of MEP, and are intended to help states improve the planning, coordination, and implementation
of their technology extension activities. In conjunction with this notice, the MEP program office will conduct workshops
and make MEP staff available to describe fully the projects in advance of a formal solicitation for proposals.


The three projects are:


Program Planning:

 To support the creation of a program plan for a state-wide, coordinated technology extension system to enhance the
competitiveness of small and medium-sized manufacturers through the application of technology.


Program Implementation:

 To support the initial implementation of a comprehensive state-wide industrial extension program or the pilot testing
of new program and service concepts to help small and medium-sized manufacturers improve productivity and competitiveness.


Regional Linkages:

 To support inter-state or multi-state efforts to expand the scope and enhance the effectiveness of technical assistance
services available regionally to small and medium-sized manufacturers.
Program Planning projects are open to all states, regardless of state size, industrial density/sparseness, or number
of existing industrial assistance programs.
For Program Implementation and Regional Linkages projects, NIST plans to give priority consideration to projects
having the best potential to benefit areas with relatively sparse distribution of industry, or low industry density
areas that do not lend themselves to large extension centers as a method of service delivery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


In accordance with the provisions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 2781), as amended,
NIST will provide assistance in FY94 to help states develop manufacturing assistance programs aimed at small- and
medium-sized manufacturers and help bring those state programs to a level of performance where they can provide the
full range of manufacturing extension services required by their manufacturers. Under the NIST Manufacturing Extension
Partnership (MEP), a cooperative effort to link and strengthen the nation's manufacturing extension programs and
activities, NIST will make merit-based awards to states to help improve their planning, coordination, and implementation
of their technology extension activities. This funding will also be available to multi-state partnerships which
seek to expand the scope of technology assistance related services regionally available to small- and medium-sized
manufacturers. MEP assumes a broad definition of manufacturing, and recognizes a wide range of technology and concepts,
including durable goods production; chemical, biotechnology and other materials processing; chemical, biotechnology
and other materials processing; electronic component and system fabrication; and engineering services associated
with manufacturing, as lying within the definition of manufacturing. 


Funding Available 


Approximately, $2,500,000 will be available to support cooperative agreements on a matching funds basis under this
program. Funding size will vary according to the project category and scope of work. For example, program planning
projects have typically averaged less than $100,000 in past years. Program Planning projects that include pilot
testing of the proposed extension plan will be eligible for NIST funding up to $150,000. For Program Implementation
projects and Regional Linkage projects, awards will also vary, but NIST funds may not exceed $250,000 per project.
States will be able to submit proposals for each of the three project categories. 
The cooperative agreements entered into under this program will be available for one year. NIST will have no obligation
to provide any additional future funding to applicants selected for funding under these projects. Renewal of an award
to increase funding or extend the period of performance will be at the local discretion of NIST. 


Projects


Program Planning Projects


Project Objective 


The purpose of Program Planning projects will be to create plans for state-wide, coordinated, technology extension
programs in order to enhance the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized manufacturers. These projects will
plan for the development and coordination of existing and/or newly formed services, such as state industrial assistance
programs; workforce training; university-based industrial assistance programs; and management assistance programs;
into a unified state-wide program. Plans will include providing access to a wide range of technology and services,
such as technology deployment, worker skills development, technology transfer and commercialization, or export
and market development. 
Applicants may conduct planning activities on a regional basis within a state, when regions are defined by the state.
Regions should be clearly defined by the proposing organizations and it must be clear why the program is regionally
oriented, versus state-wide, and how the regions will be integrated into a state-wide plan or interact such that state-wide
coverage is achieved. 
Applicants may include pilot testing activities as part of their planning process. If pilot testing of the proposed
extension plan is included in the project, it should include methods of evaluating the pilot's success in implementing
the proposed extension plan. Any proposed pilot activity must be consistent with the program plan developed for the
state. 


Program Planning Projects Evaluation Criteria 


Proposals from applicants will be evaluated and rated on the basis of the following criteria by an impartial competitive
review panel. Each proposal should address all five selection criteria and selection criteria 1-3 will be weighted
more heavily than criteria 4-5. Selection will be based upon total evaluation score as well as geographic distribution.

Program Implementation Projects


Project Objective


The purpose of Program Implementation projects is to support the implementation of comprehensive, state-wide industrial
extension programs and/or pilot testing of new program and service concepts, such as pilot outreach centers and other
extension activities, to help small and medium-sized manufacturers improve productivity and competitiveness.
For projects that support the implementation of a comprehensive state-wide industrial extension system, activities
must build upon existing services and be consistent with comprehensive state plans, if such plans exist. Extension
programs should provide access to a range of services, including but not limited to: technical extension, training,
management assistance, and quality improvement.
Pilot testing of new services and activities will be permitted on a limited scale where there is an intent to replicate
these services on a larger scale or to move toward full-scale implementation. Accordingly, pilot testing must include
evaluation, analysis and documentation, and may include some planning activities as necessary.
NIST plans to give priority consideration to projects having the best potential to benefit areas with relatively
sparse distribution of industry, or low density industry areas that do not lend themselves to large extension centers
as a method of service delivery.
