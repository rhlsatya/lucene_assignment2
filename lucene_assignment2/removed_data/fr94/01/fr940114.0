Mediterranean Fruit Fly; Addition to the Quarantined Areas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations by adding a new portion of Los Angeles County, CA, to the list
of quarantined areas. This action is necessary on an emergency basis to prevent the spread of the Mediterranean fruit
fly into noninfested areas of the United States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Mediterranean fruit fly, 

Ceratitis capitata

 (Wiedemann), is one of the world's most destructive pests of numerous fruits and vegetables. The Mediterranean fruit
fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of
25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.

We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.78-10; referred to below
as the regulations), and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective
on November 5, 1991, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 57573-57579, Docket No. 91-155). The regulations impose restrictions on the
interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested
areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding or removing
certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, CA, from the list of
quarantined areas. Amendments affecting California were made effective on September 10, and November 12, 1992;
and on January 19, July 16, August 3, September 22, October 14, November 23, and December 22, 1993 (57 FR 42485-42486,
Docket No. 91-155-2; 57 FR 54166-54169, Docket No. 91-155-3; 58 FR 6343-6346,
Docket No. 91-155-4; 58 FR 39123-39124, Docket No. 91-155-5; 58 FR 42489-42491,
Docket No. 91-155-6; 58 FR 49186-49190, Docket No. 91-155-7; 58 FR 53105-53109,
Docket No. 91-155-8; 58 FR 63027-63031, Docket No. 91-155-9; and 58 FR 67627-67630,
Docket No. 91-155-10). 
Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have revealed that additional infestations of Medfly have been discovered
in the Wilmington area in Los Angeles County, CA. 
The regulations in  301.78-3 provide that the Administrator of APHIS will list as a quarantined area each
State, or each portion of a State, in which the Medfly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has
reason to believe that the Medfly is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of
its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the Medfly has been found. 
In accordance with these criteria and the recent Medfly findings described above, we are amending  301.78-3
by expanding the area that extends through Los Angeles and Orange Counties with the addition of a Los Angeles County
area of approximately 101 square miles. The new quarantined area is as follows: 


Los Angeles County 


That portion of Los Angeles County bounded by a line drawn as follows: Beginning at the intersection of State Highway
91 and Crenshaw Boulevard; then south along Crenshaw Boulevard to its intersection with North Palos Verdes Drive;
then east along North Palos Verdes Drive to its intersection with Palos Verdes Drive East; then south along Palos Verdes
Drive East to its intersection with 25th Street; then east along 25th Street to its intersection with Gaffey Street;
then north along Gaffey Street to its intersection with 22nd Street; then east along 22nd Street to its intersection
with Pacific Avenue; then south along Pacific Avenue to its intersection with Bluff Place; then south from this intersection
along an imaginary line to its intersection with the Pacific Ocean coastline; then east along the Pacific Ocean coastline
to its intersection with the San Pedro Breakwater; then east along the San Pedro Breakwater to the Los Angeles Harbor
Light Station; then east from the Los Angeles Harbor Light Station along an imaginary line to the Los Angeles Harbor
Entrance East Light; then northeast from the Los Angeles Harbor Entrance East Light along the Middle Breakwater to
the Long Beach Harbor Light Station; then north from the Long Beach Harbor Light Station along an imaginary line to
the intersection of Harbor Scenic Way and Harbor Scenic Drive; then northwest along Scenic Harbor Drive to its intersection
with Queen's Way; then north along Queen's Way to its intersection with Ocean Boulevard; then east along Ocean Boulevard
to its intersection with Alamitos Avenue; then northeast along Alamitos Avenue to its intersection with State Highway
1; then east along State Highway 1 to its intersection with Cherry Avenue; then north along Cherry Avenue to its intersection
with Willow Street; then east on Willow Street to its intersection with Lakewood Boulevard; then north on Lakewood
Boulevard to its intersection with Carson Street; then west on Carson Street to its intersection with Paramount Boulevard;
then north on Paramount Boulevard to its intersection with State Highway 91; then West on Highway 91 to the point of
beginning.

Emergency Action 


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas of the United States. 
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.

This interim rule affects the interstate movement of regulated articles from the Wilmington area of Los Angeles County,
CA. There are approximately 223 small entities that could be affected, including 122 fruit sellers, 21 nurseries,
6 distributors, 7 growers, 50 vendors, 6 food banks, 1 farmers' market, and 10 swapmeets. 
These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State
of California. In addition, most of these small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate,
not interstate, movement, and the sale of these articles would not be affected by this interim regulation. 
In the new quarantined area in Los Angeles County, the effect on those few small entities that do move regulated articles
interstate from parts of the quarantined areas will be minimized by the availability of various treatments that,
in most cases, will allow these small entities to move regulated articles interstate with very little additional
cost. Also, many of these entities sell other items in addition to the regulated articles so that the effect, if any,
of this regulation on these entities should be minimal. Further, the number of affected entities is small compared
with the thousands of small entities that move these articles interstate from nonquarantined areas in California
and other States. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

National Environmental Policy Act 



An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this rule. The assessment
provides a basis for our conclusion that implementation of integrated pest management to achieve eradication of
the Medfly would not have a significant impact on human health and the natural environment. 

The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 

Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available for public inspection
at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. In addition, copies may be obtained by writing to the individual listed

Support Prices for Shorn Wool, Wool on Unshorn Lambs, and Mohair for the 1993 Marketing Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 14, 1993, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued a proposed rule (58 FR 37876) with respect to the support
prices for shorn wool, wool on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1993 marketing year. The support level for wool on unshorn
lambs has been determined by taking 80 percent of the difference between the 1993 support price for shorn wool and the
1993 national average market price for shorn wool, multiplied by 5 pounds (the amount of wool on an average 100-pound
unshorn lamb). The mohair support level has been determined to be $4.738, which is equal to 85 percent of the comparable
percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported for the 1993 marketing year. These actions are required by section
703 of the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to be a ``significant regulatory
action.'' Based on information compiled by USDA, it has been determined that this final rule: 
(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million; 
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 

(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule since the CCC is not
required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the
subject matter of these determinations. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 


Federal Assistance Program 



The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: National Wool Act Payments_10.059. 


Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this final rule do not
preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not involve administrative appeals. 


Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115
(June 24, 1983). 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The amendments to 7 CFR part 1468 set forth in this final rule will not result in any change in the public reporting burden.
Therefore, the information collection requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act are not applicable to this amendment.

Final Regulatory Impact Analysis 



The Final Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this final rule and the impact
of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual. 


Background 



This final rule amends 7 CFR part 1468 to set forth determinations with respect to the support prices for shorn wool,
wool on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1993 marketing year. A general description of the statutory basis for such
determinations in this final rule was set forth at 58 FR 37876 (July 14, 1993). 

A total of seven comments were received during the 30-day public comment period that ended August 13, 1993. Three respondents
recommended that no changes be made to current support rates. Three respondents recommended that the price support
programs be eliminated. In response to these 6 comments, it should be noted that although the proposed rule will be
adopted without change, the wool and mohair programs will cease to exist after December 31, 1995. 

One respondent suggested that full payment for wool on unshorn lambs should be made only on unshorn lambs up to 125 pounds,
liveweight, and that no payments should be made on any weight exceeding 125 pounds. The respondent cited a problem
with the current payment method which prorates payments based on the amount of weight gained while the lamb is owned
first by the producer and later, a lamb feeder. The respondent noted that prorating payments encourages the production
of over-fat lambs_a product that is not wanted by the American consumer_resulting in low lamb prices to the detriment
of producers. This comment has not been adopted because it would increase recordkeeping requirements significantly
for both ASCS and program participants, and it would require ASCS to make major revisions to the current procedure
for calculating unshorn lamb payments. The potential savings resulting from lower payments would not be sufficient
to justify such an increase in the administrative burden. 

After considering these comments, the following determinations have been made with respect to the wool and mohair
price support programs for the 1993 marketing year. 



Support Price_Wool on Unshorn Lambs 


In accordance with section 703 of the Wool Act, the support price for wool on unshorn lambs shall be determined by taking
80 percent of the difference between the 1993 support price for shorn wool and the 1993 national average market price
for shorn wool, multiplied by 5 pounds (the amount of wool pulled from the pelt of an average 100-pound unshorn lamb).



Support Price_Mohair 




In accordance with section 703 of the Wool Act, the support price for mohair for the 1993 marketing year shall be $4.738,
which is equal to 85 percent of the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported for the 1993 marketing
year. 

The support programs conducted pursuant to the Wool Act are subject to the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Deficit
Reduction Act of 1985, as amended. As a result, the price support levels announced in this rule may be recalculated
to comply with this Act. 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR part 1468 



Assistance grant programs_agriculture, Livestock, Mohair, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Wool.

Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1468 is amended as follows: 



PART 1468_WOOL AND MOHAIR 



1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1468 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1781-1787; 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c. 




2. Section 1468.4 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 


 1468.4 

Eligibility for payments. 


* * * * * 



(b)(1) The shorn wool support price for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be 77.5 percent of an amount which
is determined by multiplying 62 cents (the support price in 1965) by the ratio of: 

(i) The average of the parity index (the index of prices paid by farmers, including commodities and services, interest,
taxes, and farm wage rates) for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which such support
price is being determined and announced to: 

(ii) The average parity index for the three calendar years 1958, 1959, and 1960, rounding the result to the nearest
full cent. The shorn wool support price shall be as follows: 

(A) 1991_$1.88 per pound. 

(B) 1992_$1.97 per pound. 

(C) 1993_$2.04 per pound. 

(2) The payment rate for wool on unshorn lambs for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be 80 percent of the difference
between the national average price received by producers for shorn wool during a specified marketing year and the
shorn wool support price multiplied by 5 (the average grease wool yield per hundredweight of live, unshorn lambs marketed).
The payment rate for wool on unshorn lambs shall be as follows: 

(i) 1991_$5.32 per hundredweight. 

(ii) 1992_$4.92 per hundredweight. 

(iii) 1993_an amount equal to 80 percent of the difference between the national average price received by producers
for shorn wool for the 1993 marketing year and the 1993 shorn wool support price, multiplied by 5. 

(3) The mohair support price for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be established at such level, in relationship
to the support price for shorn wool, which is determined necessary to maintain approximately the same percentage
of parity for mohair as for shorn wool. The mohair support price shall be set within a range of 15 per centum above or below
the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported, as determined and announced by CCC. The support
price for mohair shall be as follows: 


(i) 1991_$4.448 per pound. 

(ii) 1992_$4.613 per pound. 

(iii) 1993_$4.738 per pound.

Change in Disease Status of Belgium Because of Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth Disease 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. Rinderpest has not existed in Belgium since
1920 and there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease since 1976. This action removes the prohibition on
the importation from Belgium into the United States of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants,
and relieves restrictions on the importation from Belgium of milk and milk products from ruminants. This action does
not relieve restrictions on the importation from Belgium of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine,
because Belgium has not been declared free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. 



We also are adding Belgium to a list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease,
are subject to restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States. Finally,
we also are adding Belgium to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas and alpacas
is restricted. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') govern the importation into the United
States of specified animals and animal products to prevent the introduction into the United States of various diseases,
including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever,
hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants
and swine. 

On September 13, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47834-47836, Docket No. 93-103-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by adding Belgium to
the list in  94.1(a)(2) of countries that are declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. 

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day period ending on October 13, 1993. During that period,
we received one comment from a national dairy association requesting that we reopen and extend the comment period
so that its members would have ample time to prepare and submit comments. In response, on October 28, 1993, we published
in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57971-57972, Docket No. 93-103-2) a document reopening and extending the comment period
until November 29, 1993. We considered all comments received following the date of publication of the proposed rule
and on or before the new comment period closing date. We received only one comment by the new comment period closing
date, from a national dairy cattle breed association, which fully supported our proposed rule. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule without change. 



Effective Date 



This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Belgium, of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation, from Belgium, of milk and milk
products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure that Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change in the regulations.
Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should
be made effective 15 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.


We are adding Belgium to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action removes
the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Belgium, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen
meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation, from Belgium, of milk and milk products from ruminants.
This action does not relieve restrictions on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine
from Belgium because Belgium is still considered to be affected with hog cholera and SVD. 

Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Belgium into the United States as a result of this rule. 

The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1991 was $951.6 million, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1991
was about $1.6 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Belgium during 1991. In fact, no cattle
or sheep were imported into the United States from any country in Western Europe during 1991 (USDA, Economic Research
Service (ERS), ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,'' 1992). Western
Europe is not a source of ruminants for the United States; any increase in the import of ruminants from Belgium as a result
of this rule will have a negligible impact on existing trade patterns. 

Currently, due to APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import uncooked meat or meat products from Belgium.
In 1991, total meat production in the United States (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while
total meat production in Belgium (excluding pork) was 385,000 metric tons, less than four percent of United States
production. It is improbable that Belgium will begin to export any significant portion of its meat products to the
United States as a result of this rule. Therefore, we estimate that the effect of this rule on domestic meat prices or
supplies will be insignificant.

<TEXT>
 

Similarly, we do not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Belgium into the United States
as a result of this rule. Importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates,
is restricted by quotas. Furthermore, while the United States imports more than half of the casein produced in the
world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest or FMD
exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Belgium does not
currently export casein to the United States. Consequently, we believe that declaring Belgium free of rinderpest
and FMD will have no significant effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States. 

The effect of declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen will probably also
be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen
exports totalled $46.5 million and $10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and
$89,000, respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Belgium, we believe that due to the relatively
small size of the Belgium market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Belgium will have a minimal
impact on the United States market. 

Five United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration standards
(they have fewer than 100 employees), have expressed interest in importing bovine embryos and semen from Belgium.
APHIS expects the value of the anticipated imports to be minimal in comparison to the domestic production of these
entities. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this rule have been submitted and approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is
0579-0015. 



List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 94

Contract Market Rule Review Procedures



<AGENCY>

ACTION:

 Final rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') is amending Regulation 1.41 to revise the Commission's
requirements with respect to the number of copies of rule change proposals that an exchange must provide to the Commission.
The Commission also is adopting amendments that would revise certain of the procedures and standards set forth in
the Commission's expedited approval rules, Regulations 1.41(h) through 1.41(t), to reflect recent innovations
by the exchanges as well as miscellaneous amendments to the procedural aspects of the expedited approval rules. Other
proposed amendments include miscellaneous clarifying amendments to the Commission's Guideline No. 1.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Introduction



Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C. 7a(12), provides that all rules
 of a contract market which relate to terms and conditions
 in futures or option contracts traded on or subject to the rules of a contract market must be submitted to the Commission
for its prior approval. Section 5a(a)(12) further requires that contract markets submit all other rules to the Commission.
Such other rules may be made effective ten days after Commission receipt unless, within the ten-day period, the Exchange
requests Commission approval or the Commission notifies the Exchange that it intends to review the rules for approval.






Commission Regulation 1.41 sets forth procedures for submitting proposed exchange rules for Commission approval,
permitting certain exchange rules to go into effect without Commission approval, and dealing with exchange emergency
rules. All proposed exchange rules relating to the terms and conditions of a commodity futures or option contract
must, and any other rule may, be submitted for prior Commission approval, under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, pursuant
to procedures set forth in Regulation 1.41(b). Regulation 1.41(c) sets forth the submission requirements for rules
that do not relate to terms and conditions and which may be placed into effect without Commission approval ten days
after receipt by the Commission. Regulation 1.41(d) sets forth the submission requirements for rules that are exempt
from the requirements of Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act. Regulations 1.41(h) through (t) set forth conditions under
which, in lieu of submission under Regulation 1.41(b), certain types of exchange rule proposals relating to terms
and conditions requiring Commission approval may be deemed approved either upon adoption by the exchange or within
a specified number of days of Commission receipt, which ranges from one to ten days.

In submitting rules to the Commission under any of Regulations 1.41(b), 1.41(c), or 1.41(h) through (t), an exchange
is required to furnish three copies of the proposal to the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters and one copy to
the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange. For rules submitted under the
provisions of Regulation 1.41(d), an exchange is required to furnish one copy of the proposal to the Commission's
Washington, DC headquarters and one copy to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over
that exchange. 
Commission Regulation 1.41a sets forth procedures delegating to the Directors of the Divisions of Trading and Markets
(T&M) and Economic Analysis (DEA) the authority to make certain decisions regarding rule submissions. Specifically,
this regulation delegates to the Directors of T&M and DEA the authority to determine: (1) Whether to remit and
not accept for review rules submitted under Regulations 1.41(b), (c) or (d) that do not comply with the applicable
submission requirements of those regulations; (2) whether a rule submission submitted under Regulation 1.41(c)
or (d) relates to terms and conditions thus requiring prior Commission approval pursuant to the provisions of Regulation
1.41(b); (3) whether rules submitted under Regulation 1.41(c) do not require prior approval under Section 5a(a)(12)
of the Act and Regulation 1.41(b) and whether such rules may become effective prior to the expiration of the ten-day
period following receipt for such rules by the Commission; and (4) whether proposals submitted under any of the expedited
procedures of Regulations 1.41(h) through (t) comply with the applicable provisions of these regulations and, if
not, to notify the contract market that the submission is subject to the provisions of Regulation 1.41(b). 


II. Amendments to Regulation 1.41 



The Commission is adopting amendments to Regulation 1.41 that would revise the requirements of Regulations 1.41(b),
1.41(c) and 1.41(h) through (t) to reduce to one from three the number of copies of rule change proposals that an exchange
must furnish to the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters for rule changes submitted under these regulations.
However, with respect to applications for contract market designation, under the amendments the exchanges would
continue to be required to submit three copies of the application, including the proposed rules, to the Commission
at its Washington, DC headquarters. Amendments to appendix A to part 5 of the Commission's regulations reflect this
continuing requirement. 

Also, the Commission is eliminating the requirement that exchanges must submit one copy of rules submitted under
Regulations 1.41(d) and 1.41(h) through (t) to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over
that exchange. The exchanges would continue to be required to submit one copy of rule proposals submitted under Commission
Regulations 1.41(b) and 1.41(c) to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange.


The Commission has reviewed its procedures for processing rule submissions under Regulations 1.41(b), 1.41(c),
and 1.41(h) through (t), and, as a result of that review, the Commission has determined that the submission of more
than one copy of a rule change proposal to the Washington, DC headquarters is not necessary. Moreover, the Commission
has determined that, for rule change proposals submitted under Regulations 1.41(d) and 1.41(h) through (t), the
submission of a copy of such rule to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange
also is not necessary.
 Further, these amendments would diminish the paperwork burden on the exchanges and would reduce costs associated
with filing submissions under these regulations.

The Commission also is adopting amendments that would clarify and update the standards set forth in the expedited
approval procedures in paragraphs (h), (l), (o), (p), and (q) of Regulation 1.41. Paragraph (h) establishes an expedited
review procedure for changes to the composition, computation, or method of stock selection of a stock index in which
a contract market is designated to trade futures contracts, or options on such futures contracts. Currently, such
changes are deemed approved upon adoption by the contract market if: (i) The index is compiled for commercial purposes
by an independent third party; (ii) the change is consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved
by the Commission for this purpose which specifically defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition
of the stock index upon which the designated futures contracts are authorized to trade; (iii) the contract market
provides the Commission with written notice of the change within five days after the change is adopted by the contract
market; and (iv) the contract market labels the written notice as being submitted under Regulation 1.41(h). This
expedited procedure was established because routine changes to an index to maintain its continuity were not expected
to require detailed review by the Commission under paragraph (b) of Regulation 1.41. 

Based on approximately 10 years of experience in administering the provisions of Regulation 1.41(h), the Commission
has determined that the submission to the Commission on a routine basis of changes which relate to maintaining the
continuity of a stock index is not necessary. Further, deleting this requirement would reduce the paperwork burden
on the exchanges. 

Accordingly, the amendment to Regulation 1.41(h) would delete items (iii) and (iv) above, so that a contract market
no longer would be required to submit routinely to the Commission a written notice of a change in the composition, computation,
or method of stock selection that is made to maintain the continuity of a stock index in which that contract market is
designated to trade futures or futures option contracts. In order for such a change to be deemed approved by the Commission
pursuant to Regulation 1.41(h) as amended, the index must continue to be compiled for commercial purposes by an independent
third party, and the change must be consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved by the Commission
for this purpose which defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition of the stock index. Under the
amended regulation, however, such changes would not routinely be required to be submitted to the Commission following
adoption by the exchange. As currently provided, contract markets would continue to be required to submit to the Commission
for review and approval under Regulation 1.41(b) all changes to the composition, computation, or method of stock
selection that are for purposes other than the continuity of the index. 

Further, under amended Regulation 1.41(h), contract markets would be required to provide to the Commission, upon
special call to the contract market, information regarding the composition, computation, or method of stock selection
of the index, including any change or changes related to the continuity of the index, or any other issues relating to
the index, as instructed, and within the time, and for the period, specified in the call. Such a special call would provide
the Commission with information, as requested, to assure that the contract market continued to meet its regulatory
obligations. 

Paragraph (l) of Regulation 1.41 establishes an expedited procedure for changes in trading months. Such changes
are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain
conditions are satisfied. The amendment to paragraph (l) would clarify that this paragraph applies to exchange proposals
to delist contract months without open interest as well as to exchange proposals to list new months. In that regard,
the division directors or their delegees routinely process requests to delist contact months under Regulation 1.41(l),
as long as the months to be delisted have no open interest. The amendment simply clarifies the division directors'
delegated authority in this regard.

Paragraph (o) establishes an expedited procedure for changes in strike price listing procedures. Such changes are
deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain conditions
are satisfied. The amendment to paragraph (o) would clarify that this paragraph applies to exchange proposals to
amend strike price listing procedures for listed options without open interest, as well as for options not listed,
at the time the rule goes into effect. 
Paragraph (p) establishes an expedited procedure for changes in the last trading day of an option contract. Such changes
are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain
conditions are satisfied. One amendment to paragraph (p) would clarify that this paragraph applies to listed options
without open interest, as well as to options not listed, at the time the rule goes into effect. Another amendment is
non-substantive and would correct a typographical error in section (3) of that paragraph. Specifically, the amendment
would clarify that the Commission will, within 10 days after receipt of a submission regarding a change in option last
trading day specifications, notify the contract market if the change appears to not be consistent with the provisions
of this paragraph. 
Paragraph (q) of Regulation 1.41 provides that changes related to ``cabinet trade'' provisions for options may be
approved under expedited procedures. A cabinet trade currently is defined as an option trade that represents a closing
transaction for both parties to the trade and which is specifically identified as such in the contract market's rules.
The amendments to paragraph (q) revise the expedited approval standard to remove the requirement that option cabinet
trade rules eligible for treatment under this paragraph must involve closing transactions exclusively. This revision
in the expedited approval standard reflects recent innovations by the exchanges with respect to cabinet trade provisions.
An amendment to section (3) of that paragraph is non-substantive and corrects a typographical error. Specifically,
the amendment clarifies that the Commission will, within 10 days after receipt of a submission regarding a change
in the cabinet trade provisions of an option contract, notify the contract market if the change appears to not be consistent
with the provisions of this paragraph. 


III. Amendments to Regulation 1.41a 


In connection with the foregoing amendments to Regulation 1.41, the Commission is adopting amendments to paragraph
(a)(5) of Regulation 1.41a. Currently, as noted above, this regulation delegates to the Director of the Division
of Trading and Markets and to the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, authority
to determine whether changes submitted under paragraphs (h)-(t) of Regulation 1.41 are inconsistent with
the relevant provisions of those paragraphs and to notify contract markets if such submissions are to be subject to
the usual review procedures under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and Regulation 1.41(b). 
One amendment to Regulation 1.41a provides that the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and the Director
of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, have the delegated authority to give notice that
rules submitted pursuant to   1.41(k)-(t) comply with the provisions of   1.41(k)-(t),
as applicable, and therefore shall be deemed approved prior to the end of the period specified in the applicable rule.
Such period commences on the day the rule is received by the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters. The Commission
has received requests from exchanges for notice that rules submitted under the expedited procedures of   1.41(k)-(t)
are deemed approved prior to the end of the specified period in order to provide for timely implementation of rules
to respond to rapidly changing market conditions or to avoid a market problem. 
Another amendment to Regulation 1.41a would expand the delegated authority of the Director of the Division of Trading
and Markets and the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, to notify a contract
market that a rule submitted under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and  1.41(b) will be treated as if submitted pursuant
to   1.41(h)-(t), as applicable, if the rule submitted pursuant to the provisions of  1.41(b)
complies with any of the provisions of   1.41(h)-(t). Current procedures can delay processing
of the proposal and impede timely implementation of the rule.

IV. Amendments to Commission Guideline No. 1 



Guideline No. 1 sets forth the Commission's economic and public interest requirements for initial and continuing
designation of a contract market in a particular commodity. The Commission is proposing to revise this guideline
to correct an improper rule reference. Specifically, item 5 in column 2 of the ``Option Designation Checklist For
Options On Futures Contracts'' (option on futures checklist) and the ``Option Designation Checklist For Options
on Physicals'' (option on physicals checklist) regarding the option expiration criteria cites Commission Regulation
33.4(d)(1) as the applicable Commission regulation for these criteria. However, as a result of substantive revisions
to the Commission's option regulations adopted in September 1991 (56 FR 43694), many of the Commission's option regulations
were renumbered, including Regulation 33.4(d)(1) which was renumbered as 33.4(b)(2). Therefore, the Commission
hereby is amending the option checklists to replace 33.4(d)(1) with 33.4(b)(2) as the cited Commission regulation
for the option expiration criteria in each of those checklists. 



Related Matters 



A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.,

 requires that agencies, in adopting rules, consider their impact on small businesses. The Commission has previously
determined that contract markets are not small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 47 FR 18618
(April 30, 1982). Moreover, no additional regulatory burdens are imposed by these amendments. Therefore, the Acting
Chairman on behalf of the Commission hereby certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the action taken herein will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



B. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., imposes certain requirements on federal agencies
(including the Commission) in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any collection of information as defined
by the Paperwork Reduction Act. In compliance with the Act, the Commission has submitted these amended rules and their
associated information collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget. 

While these amended rules result in no increased burden, the group of rules (OMB control 

#

 3038-0007) of which they are a part has the following burden: 



Average Burden Hours per Response: 

50.34. 



Number of Respondents: 

10,727,182. 



Frequency of Response: 

Monthly. 

Persons wishing to comment on the estimated paperwork burden associated with these amended rules should contact
Gary Waxman, Office of Management and Budget, room 3228, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. Copies of the information collection
submission to OMB are available from Joe F. Mink, CFTC Clearance Officer, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581,
(202) 254-9735.

C. Notice and Comment 


Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), requires in most instances that a notice of proposed
rulemaking be published in the 

Federal Register

 and that opportunity for comment be provided when an agency promulgates new regulations. Section 553(b) sets forth
an exception, however, for rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. The instant amendments provide
expedited procedures for the approval of certain contract market rules. The Commission has determined that these
amendments, which will reduce the burden on the exchanges, relate to Commission procedure and practice and therefore
that notice and comment is not required. 
Section 553(b) also sets forth an exception to the requirement of notice and opportunity for public comment when the
Commission for good cause finds such notice and public comment are unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.
The Commission finds that notice and public comment on the rule changes announced herein are unnecessary because
the changes are procedural in nature and do not establish any new obligations under the Act.

(i) The index is compiled for commercial purposes by an independent third party; and 
(ii) The change is consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved by the Commission for this purpose
which specifically defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition of the stock index upon which the

(iv) If contract market rules submitted pursuant to the provisions of  1.41(b) comply with any of the provisions
of   1.41(h) through (t), to notify the contract market that such rules will be treated as if submitted

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final interpretive rule; correction.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects a previously published decision of Customs by adding Headquarters Ruling HQ 735085 (June
4, 1993), to the list of previous determinations affected by the decision. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 


On December 29, 1993, Customs published a decision in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 68743) concerning the country of origin marking requirements for imported frozen produce. The decision implemented
a new Customs interpretation of section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304). Under the decision,
packages of imported frozen produce will be required to be marked with their country of origin on the front side of the
packaging in specified types and styles. However, the decision's section entitled: ``Previous Decisions Affected''
should have made clear that HQ 735085 (June 4, 1993) was being modified accordingly. This section on page 68747, second
column, is corrected to read, in its entirety, as follows: 


Previous Decisions Affected 


HRL 731830 (November 21, 1988), is revoked. HQ 735085 (June 4, 1993), and a related determination, HRL 735222 (June
28, 1993), are modified such that the rendering of the required marking shall be in accordance with this decision.
T.D. 91-48 (May 28, 1991), is modified. Conspicuous marking within the meaning of T.D. 91-48 shall be limited
to marking which complies with the specifications set forth in this decision.

Railroad Employers' Reports and Responsibilities



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

 Railroad Retirement Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Interim final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

 The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) hereby amends its regulations to increase the amount of gross earnings required
to be reported by employers. This amendment is necessary to reflect increases in the tax and benefit bases.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 Benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) are financed by an employment tax imposed under the Railroad Retirement
Tax Act (RRTA) upon wages paid by railroad employers. The tax has two components, a tier I level and a tier II level. The
tier I level is the same as the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and is used to finance what
are the equivalent of social security benefits payable under the RRA. The amount of compensation subject to tax is
based upon the contribution and benefit base as defined in section 230 of the Social Security Act (see 26 U.S.C. 3231(e)(2)(B)).
The contribution base generally rises each year to reflect increases in the national wage rate. In order to estimate
future revenues the Board has required employers to report gross earnings, up to $300,000, of a one-percent sample
of their employees (20 CFR 209.12). However, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 eliminated the wage cap
base for the Hospital Insurance Program (Medicare) portion of the tier I tax. Consequently, the $300,000 cap is no
longer adequate for making computations with respect to the financial interchange between the railroad retirement
and social security/medicare trust funds. Railroad retirement beneficiaries are covered under Medicare by virtue
of section 7(d) of the RRA.




Consequently, the Board is amending its regulations to require employers to report gross wages, not just wages up
to $300,000.

In order for the amendment increasing the amount of reportable earnings to be effective with respect to the 1993 reports,
due by March 1, 1994, the Board is publishing this rule as an interim final rule. However, the Board does invite comments
on the change.

The information collections associated with these amendments have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under Control Number 3220-0132.

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to expand the safe use of aromatic
petroleum hydrocarbon resin hydrogenated, as a component of wax polymer blend coatings for paper and paperboard
in contact with fatty foods. This action responds to a food additive petition filed by Arakawa Chemical Industries,
Ltd.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 17, 1992 (57 FR 9260), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4315) had been filed by Arakawa Chemical
Industries, Ltd., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001. The petition proposed that  176.170


Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of hydrogenated aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin in coatings
on paper and paperboard in contact with fatty foods.


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed expanded use of
the additive is safe. The agency further concludes that  176.170 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before February 14, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Rico State Plans



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Labor. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This document gives notice of Federal approval of State Plan supplements concerning the Utah, Arizona and Puerto
Rico Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). These programs are modeled on the OSHA VPP, which recognize excellence
in worksite safety and health. Employers participating in VPP can realize lower workers' injury rates, lower workers'
compensation costs and greater employee productivity. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



The Utah Occupational Safety and Health Plan was approved under section 18(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667(c)) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and Part 1902 of this chapter on January 10, 1973
(38 FR 1178). A determination of final approval was made under section 18(e) of the Act on July 16, 1985 (50 FR 28770).


The Arizona Occupational Safety and Health Plan was approved under section 18(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667(c)) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and Part 1902 of this chapter on October 29, 1974
(39 FR 39037). A determination of final approval was made under section 18(e) of the Act on June 20, 1985 (50 FR 25571).


The Puerto Rico Occupational Safety and Health Plan was approved under section 18(c) of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667(c)) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and 29 CFR Part 1902 on August 30, 1977 (42
FR 43629).

Part 1953 of this chapter provides procedures for the review and the approval of State change supplements by the Assistant
Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter referred to as the Assistant Secretary). 



B. Description of Supplements



On June 18, 1992, Jay W. Bagley, Administrator, Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division, submitted a plan change
supplement concerning Utah's Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). After Federal review of the Utah VPP and subsequent
modifications made by the State, Utah's program was found to be generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection,
as described in the 

Federal Register

 on July 2, 1982 (47 FR 29025). 

On August 30, 1993, Cathy Neville, Assistant Director, Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, submitted
a plan change supplement concerning Arizona's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). After Federal review of the Arizona
VPP, Arizona's program was found to be generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection Programs, with the
exception that the State's VPP is limited to the Star Program in general industry, excludes the Merit and Demonstration
Programs and excludes the construction industry. 

On January 10, 1993, Yazminnie Vazquez, Director, Voluntary Program, Puerto Rico submitted a plan change supplement
concerning Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). The Puerto Rico program also was found to be generally
identical to the Federal VPP with the exception of changes to reflect different structure and exclusion of the Demonstration
Program. 



C. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying



A copy of the State plan supplement on the Utah VPP may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following
locations: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of the Regional Administrator,
room 1554, Federal Building, 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado 80202; the Industrial Commission of Utah, UOSHA
Offices at 160 East 300 South, 3rd Floor, P.O. Box 146600, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114-6600. 

A copy of the State plan supplement on the Arizona VPP may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the
following locations: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of the Regional
Administrator, 71 Stevenson Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105; Industrial Commission of Arizona,

Safety and Health Administration, Directorate of Federal-State Operations, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room
N3700, Washington, DC 20210.



D. Public Participation



Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite
the review process or for any other good cause which may be consistent with applicable law. The Assistant Secretary
finds that Utah's, Arizona's and Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs are generally identical to the Federal
Voluntary Protection Programs, meet Federal requirements and were adopted by the States in accordance with State
procedural requirements. Good cause is therefore found for approval of these supplements and further public participation
would be unnecessary.



E. Decision



After careful consideration and review by the Regional and National Offices, the Utah, Arizona and Puerto Rico plan
supplements described above are found to meet OSHA requirements and are hereby approved under part 1953 of this chapter.
The decision incorporates the requirements of the Act and implementing regulations applicable to State plans generally.

<USDEPT>PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION</USDEPT>





Late Premium Payments and Employer Liability Underpayments and Overpayments; Interest Rate for Determining Variable
Rate Premium; Amendments to Interest Rates


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document notifies the public of the interest rate applicable to late premium payments and employer liability
underpayments and overpayments for the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1994. This interest rate is established
quarterly by the Internal Revenue Service. This document also sets forth the interest rates for valuing unfunded
vested benefits for premium purposes for plan years beginning in November 1993 through January 1994. These interest
rates are established pursuant to section 4006 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
The effect of these amendments is to advise plan sponsors and pension practitioners of these new interest rates.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As part of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') collects premiums from ongoing plans to support the single-employer and multiemployer
insurance programs. Under the single-employer program, the PBGC also collects employer liability from those persons
described in ERISA section 4062(a). Under ERISA section 4007 and 29 CFR 2610.7, the interest rate to be charged on unpaid
premiums is the rate established under section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code (``Code''). Similarly, under 29
CFR 2622.7, the interest rate to be credited or charged with respect to overpayments or underpayments of employer
liability is the section 6601 rate. These interest rates are published by the PBGC in appendix A to the premium regulation
and appendix A to the employer liability regulation.


The Internal Revenue Service has announced that for the quarter beginning January 1, 1994, the interest charged on
the underpayment of taxes will be at a rate of 7 percent. Accordingly, the PBGC is amending appendix A to 29 CFR part 2610
and appendix A to 29 CFR part 2622 to set forth this rate for the January 1, 1994, through March 31, 1994, quarter. 
Under ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii)(II), in determining a single-employer plan's unfunded vested benefits
for premium computation purposes, plans must use an interest rate equal to 80% of the annual yield on 30-year Treasury
securities for the month preceding the beginning of the plan year for which premiums are being paid. Under  2610.23(b)(1)
of the premium regulation, this value is determined by reference to 30-year Treasury constant maturities as reported
in Federal Reserve Statistical Releases G.13 and H.15. The PBGC publishes these rates in appendix B to the regulation.

The PBGC publishes these monthly interest rates in appendix B on a quarterly basis to coincide with the publication
of the late payment interest rate set forth in appendix A. (The PBGC publishes the appendix A rates every quarter, regardless
of whether the rate has changed.) Unlike the appendix A rate, which is determined prospectively, the appendix B rate
is not known until a short time after the first of the month for which it applies. Accordingly, the PBGC is hereby amending
appendix B to part 2610 to add the vested benefits valuation rates for plan years beginning in November 1993 through
January 1994. 
The appendices to 29 CFR parts 2610 and 2622 do not prescribe the interest rates under these regulations. Under both
regulations, the appendix A rates are the rates determined under section 6601(a) of the Code. The interest rates in
appendix B to part 2610 are prescribed by ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii)(II) and  2610.23(b)(1) of the regulation.
These appendices merely collect and republish the interest rates in a convenient place. Thus, the interest rates
in the appendices are informational only. Accordingly, the PBGC finds that notice of and public comment on these amendments
would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. For the above reasons, the PBGC also believes that good cause
exists for making these amendments effective immediately. 
The PBGC has determined that none of these actions is a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth
in Executive Order 12866, because they will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866. 
Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for these amendments, the Regulatory Flexibility Act
of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (``PBGC's'') regulations on Valuation of Plan
Benefits in Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR part 2619) and Valuation of Plan Benefits and Plan Assets Following Mass
Withdrawal (29 CFR part 2676). Part 2619 contains the interest assumptions that the PBGC uses to value benefits under
terminating single-employer plans. Part 2676 contains the interest assumptions for valuations of multiemployer
plans that have undergone mass withdrawal. The amendments set out in this final rule adopt the interest assumptions
applicable to single-employer plans with termination dates in February 1994, and to multiemployer plans with valuation
dates in February 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule adopts the February 1994 interest assumptions to be used under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's
(``PBGC's'') regulations on Valuation of Plan Benefits in Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR part 2619, the ``single-employer
regulation'') and Valuation of Plan Benefits and Plan Assets Following Mass Withdrawal (29 CFR part 2676, the ``multiemployer
regulation'').



Part 2619 sets forth the methods for valuing plan benefits of terminating single-employer plans covered under title
IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''). Under ERISA section 4041(c), all
single-employer plans wishing to terminate in a distress termination must value guaranteed benefits and ``benefit
liabilities'', i.e., all benefits provided under the plan as of the plan termination date, using the formulas set
forth in part 2619, subpart C. (Plans terminating in a standard termination may, for purposes of the Standard Termination
Notice filed with PBGC, use these formulas to value benefit liabilities, although this is not required.) In addition,
when the PBGC terminates an underfunded plan involuntarily pursuant to ERISA section 4042(a), it uses the subpart
C formulas to determine the amount of the plan's underfunding. Part 2676 prescribes rules for valuing benefits and
certain assets of multiemployer plans under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281(b) of ERISA.

Appendix B to part 2619 sets forth the interest rates and factors under the single-employer regulation. Appendix
B to part 2676 sets forth the interest rates and factors under the multiemployer regulation. Because these rates and
factors are intended to reflect current conditions in the financial and annuity markets, it is necessary to update
the rates and factors periodically.

The PBGC issues two sets of interest rates and factors, one set to be used for the valuation of benefits to be paid as annuities
and one set for the valuation of benefits to be paid as lump sums. The same assumptions apply to terminating single-employer
plans and to multiemployer plans that have undergone a mass withdrawal. This amendment adds to appendix B to parts
2619 and 2676 sets of interest rates and factors for valuing benefits in single-employer plans that have termination
dates during February 1994 and multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal and have valuation dates
during February 1994.

For annuity benefits, the interest rates will be 5.90% for the first 25 years following the valuation date and 5.25%
thereafter. For benefits to be paid as lump sums, the interest assumptions to be used by the PBGC will be 4.50% for the
period during which benefits are in pay status and 4.0% during the period preceding the benefit's placement in pay
status. (ERISA section 205(g) and Internal Revenue Code section 417(e) provide that private sector plans valuing
lump sums under $25,000 must use interest assumptions at least as generous as those used by the PBGC for valuing lump
sums (and for lump sums exceeding $25,000 are restricted to 120% of the PBGC interest assumptions).) These annuity
and lump sum interest assumptions are unchanged from the January 1994 interest assumptions.

Generally, the interest rates and factors under these regulations are in effect for at least one month. However, the
PBGC publishes its interest assumptions each month regardless of whether they represent a change from the previous
month's assumptions. The assumptions normally will be published in the 

Federal Register

 by the 15th of the preceding month or as close to the date as circumstances permit.

The PBGC has determined that notice and public comment on these amendments are impracticable and contrary to the public
interest. This finding is based on the need to determine and issue new interest rates and factors promptly so that the
rates and factors can reflect, as accurately as possible, current market conditions.

Because of the need to provide immediate guidance for the valuation of benefits in single-employer plans whose termination
dates fall during February 1994, and in multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal and have valuation
dates during February 1994, the PBGC finds that good cause exists for making the rates and factors set forth in this
amendment effective less than 30 days after publication.

The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.

Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this amendment, the Regulatory Flexibility Act
of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).

Collection of Withdrawal Liability; Adoption of New Interest Rate



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is an amendment to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's regulation on Notice and Collection of Withdrawal
Liability. That regulation incorporates certain interest rates published by another Federal agency. The effect
of this amendment is to add to the appendix of that regulation a new interest rate to be effective from January 1, 1994,
to March 21, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 4219(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``the PBGC'') promulgated a final regulation on Notice and Collection of Withdrawal
Liability. That regulation, codified at 29 CFR part 2644, deals with the rate of interest to be charged by multiemployer
pension plans on withdrawal liability payments that are overdue or in default, or to be credited by plans on overpayments
of withdrawal liability. The regulation allows plans to set rates, subject to certain restrictions. Where a plan
does not set the interest rate,  2644.3(b) of the regulation provides that the rate to be charged or credited
for any calendar quarter is the average quoted prime rate on short-term commercial loans for the fifteenth day (or
the next business day if the fifteenth day is not a business day) of the month preceding the beginning of the quarter,
as reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15 (``Selected Interest
Rates'').



Because the regulation incorporates interest rates published in Statistical Release H.15, that release is the authoritative
source for the rates that are to be applied under the regulation. As a convenience to persons using the regulation,
however, the PBGC collects the applicable rates and republishes them in an appendix to part 2644. This amendment adds
to this appendix the interest rate of 6 percent, which will be effective from January 1, 1994 through March 31, 1994.
This rate represents no change from the rate in effect for the fourth quarter of 1993. This rate is based on the prime
rate in effect on December 15, 1993.

The appendix to 29 CFR part 2644 does not prescribe interest rates under the regulation; the rates prescribed in the
regulation are those published in Statistical Release H.15. The appendix merely collects and republishes the rates
in a convenient place. Thus, the interest rates in the appendix are informational only. Accordingly, the PBGC finds
that notice of and public comment on this amendment would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. For the
above reasons, the PBGC also believes that good cause exists for making this amendment effective immediately.

The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of receipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.

Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this amendment, the Regulatory Flexibility Act
of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).

Oklahoma Permanent Regulatory Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of informal conference.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior approved Oklahoma's program under the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) (see 46 FR 4902). On November 12, 1993, OSM notified the Governor of Oklahoma that it
had reason to believe that serious problems exist that are adversely affecting the effective implementation, administration,
maintenance and enforcement of Oklahoma's approved regulatory program (see 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

below).



Under the provisions of OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 733.12(c), OSM will hold an informal conference to discuss the
facts surrounding such a notification if an informal conference is requested by the State. By letter dated December
22, 1993, the Oklahoma Department of Mines (ODM) requested an informal conference. Accordingly, OSM hereby notifies
Oklahoma and the public that it will hold an informal conference. All interested persons may attend the informal conference.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program (46 FR 4902-4911).



On November 12, 1993, OSM notified the Governor of Oklahoma that it had reason to believe that serious problems exist
that are adversely affecting the effective implementation, administration, maintenance, and enforcement of Oklahoma's
approved permanent regulatory program under SMCRA (OK-945).

Since the approval of Oklahoma's program, and in keeping with its policy of working closely with the State, OSM has
had numerous discussions with ODM officials about the State's performance. Recent discussions and investigations
have centered on inadequacies of ODM's implementation of the approved program in the areas set forth below.

1. 

Citing Violations:

 ODM has not cited all violations as the State program requires.

2. 

Unreasonable Extensions of Abatement of Violations:

 Failure to abate cessation orders have not been issued in cases where such would have been appropriate. Instead, ODM
has repeatedly extended abatement periods of violations. Contrary to the approved program, ODM has routinely extended
the period for abatement of violations cited in NOV's beyond 90 days without compelling reasons.

3. 

Civil Penalty Reductions:

 After appropriate initial assessments, ODM has frequently reduced penalties without appropriate justification
when those penalties were challenged in assessment conferences and settlement agreements.

4. 

Applicant Violator System Not Updated:

 ODM has not properly updated the applicant violator system, which negates the use of the system to block approval of
permits and revisions for entities that have outstanding violations.

5. 

Reclamation and Bonding Failure:

 ODM has allowed mine operators to create a disturbed area that is larger than the acreage specified in the approved
mine plan, thereby leading to inadequate bond.

6. 

Permit Defects:

 ODM has approved permits and permit revisions that allow practices that do not comply with the Oklahoma program.

7. 

Failure to Enact Program Amendments:

 Oklahoma has failed to promulgate rules approved in amendments to the Oklahoma program that were required for the
program to be no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.

8. 

Inadequate Allowance for Public Participation:

 ODM has not maintained or made available inspection and enforcement files in the county of the mining as required by
the State program. ODM has not thoroughly investigated and acted on citizen's comments on permitting actions. ODM
discouraged public participation through an improper decision that awarded attorney's fees to a mine operator.


In the November 12, 1993, notification, OSM specified a date for ODM to present a plan to correct the deficiencies in
the implementation of its program.

Section 733.12(c) of 30 CFR requires OSM to provide the State regulatory authority an opportunity for an informal
conference. On December 22, 1993, the Chief Counsel of ODM requested that OSM hold such an informal conference. (OK-945.02)

The informal conference may pertain to the facts of the deficiencies or the time period for accomplishing remedial
actions.

Conference Rules: The informal conference is an opportunity for OSM to discuss the status of the implementation of
Oklahoma's program with Oklahoma officials.

No testimony from the public will be taken but a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be kept.

Regulations Implementing Section 7 of the ``Negotiated Rates Act of 1993'' 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ``Negotiated Rates Act of 1993'' amends the Interstate Commerce Act by adding section 10767. Section 10767 requires
that the Commission establish regulations to prohibit, except for certain services, motor common and contract carriers
of property from providing a reduction in a tariff rate or contract rate to a person who is a nonpayer of freight charges.
This proceeding establishes, as set forth below, the regulations required by the statute.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 By a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) in Ex Parte No. MC-180 (Sub-No. 2), Rulemaking_Payment of Discounts
by Motor Carriers of Property to the Nonpayer of Freight Charges (not printed) served June 4, 1993 (58 FR 32340, June
9, 1993), the Commission instituted a proceeding to determine whether off-bill discounting where it does or may result
in a misrepresentation of shipping charges should be found to be an unreasonable practice or otherwise unlawful.
However, the ``Negotiated Rates Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103-180) since has been enacted and amends subchapter
IV of chapter 107 of title 49, United States Code, by adding section 10767, which requires that the Commission issue
regulations by April 2, 1994, that will: 



(1) 

Prohibit, 

except as described in (4) below, motor common and contract carriers of property from providing a reduction in a tariff
or contract rate to any party other than the person directly responsible to the carrier for payment of the transportation
service according to the bill of lading, receipt, or contract, or an agent of the person paying for the transportation.
49 U.S.C. 10767(a). 

(2) 

Require 

a motor common carrier of property to disclose, either by a shipping document or an electronic transmission, the actual
tariff rate, charge, or allowance to the person directly responsible for payment for the transportation service.
49 U.S.C. 10767(b). 

(3) 

Prohibit 

any person from causing a motor common carrier of property to present a document to any party of the transaction, which
contains false or misleading information about the actual tariff rate, charge, or allowance. 49 U.S.C. 10767(b).


(4) 

Permit 

motor common and contract carriers of property to make actual tariff or contract payments or allowances to a party
to the transaction, when such party performs a transportation service that would otherwise be performed by the carrier,
such as a loading and unloading service, provided that the payment or allowance is reasonably related to the cost that
such party knows or has reason to know would otherwise be incurred by the motor carrier if it had performed the service.
49 U.S.C. 10767(c). 

Because section 10767 supersedes the NPR, the Ex Parte No. MC-180 (Sub-No. 2) proceeding is discontinued. 

The Commission does not believe this revision requires notice and comment rulemaking under section 553 of the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) because it establishes regulations mandated by Congress. 

This decision will not affect significantly either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources.

Practices of Motor Common Carriers of Household Goods; 
Performance Reports


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is adopting modifications to the Annual Performance Report, Form OCP-101 (OCP-101),
which sets forth requirements that relate to carrier performance information given to prospective individual shippers
of household goods. This proceeding was instituted to address concerns expressed by consumer groups and the moving
industry regarding the quality and reliability of the information provided by household goods carriers in the OCP-101.
The modified OCP-101 requires objective disclosure by carriers of their performance to prospective shippers
and verification of accuracy of the data contained in the reports. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Currently, the Commission's rules require household goods common carriers that transport 100 or more shipments
to individual shippers, as defined in the Commission's rules, to provide information annually to the Commission
about their previous year's performance by filing an 

Annual Performance Report 

(Form OCP-101). Under the new rules adopted in this decision, 

all 

household goods common carriers will be required to file the OCP-101 annually. However, only carriers that
deliver 100 or more individual C.O.D. shipments will be required to complete the major portion of the form (Part B)
and provide copies of it to prospective shippers. Part B of the OCP-101 shows a carrier's performance in the areas
of estimating, on-time performance, and claims handling in a calendar year for C.O.D. shippers only. The OCP-101
must be filed with the Commission's Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance by March 31 of the following calendar
year. 


A notice of proposed rulemaking was published on February 3, 1993, at 58 FR 6912. Additional information is contained
in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write to, call, or pick up in person from Dynamic
Concepts, Inc., room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building, Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 289-4357/4359.
[Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services (202) 927-5721.] 


Energy and Environmental Consideration 


We conclude that modification of the regulations governing Form OCP-101 will not significantly affect either
the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. 


Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. We are modifying the OCP-101 requirements that relate to a carrier's
performance information given to prospective individual shippers of household goods by motor common carriers of
household goods transporting 100 or more C.O.D. individual-type shipments. The modified form will require verification
of the data in the report by a company official. The regulations will have some impact on the administrative costs of
preparing and duplicating the OCP-101 for smaller carriers (

i.e.,

 Class II and III carriers) of household goods. The information required for completing that form is the type of information
already kept by such entities and the time required to compile the data for that form should be minimal and vary proportionately
with the number of shipments transported by the carrier. Although transportation consumers should benefit from
the availability of this information, the cost to small carriers should be relatively minimal. Accordingly, it is
unlikely that the economic impact on these small entities will be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.

Instructions for Preparation



General Instructions



1. Data for completion of Form OCP-101 may be obtained by random sampling providing that in every instance, the
universe sampled is all shipments delivered under your common carrier authority (excluding Government, Freight
forwarder, and Interline traffic) during the report year or all claims arising out of the transportation of those
shipments that were received or settled, as appropriate, during the report year. 

2. When random sampling is used, the minimum sample size in every instance shall be 400 shipments or claims, as appropriate,
in replicates of 100 shipments or claims each. All samples must conform to standard deviation with a 95% confidence
level. 

3. Carriers submitting Form OCP-101 shall retain and make available for review by an authorized Commission
employee all working papers, notes, and other files relating to the preparation of each report for a period of not less
than 24 months following the date of filing such a report. 

4. The data in Form OCP-101 must be verified by a sworn statement signed by an official of the company. 



Specific Instructions



Part A 



Line 1: Only report those 1st proviso C.O.D. shipments moved under your common carrier authority after excluding
all Government, Freight forwarder and Interline traffic. 

Line 2: Report all other 1st proviso shipments, including those moving under contract carriage provisions and all
Government, Freight forwarder and Interline traffic. 

Line 3: Sum lines 1 and 2. The total should agree with total 1st proviso shipments reported in your ICC Annual Report,
Schedule 600, Line 7, Column d, if you are required to file that report. 



Part B 



It is not necessary to complete Part B if the total of C.O.D. shipments reported on Part A, Line 1, did not equal or exceed
100 shipments. If completion of Part B is not required, sign the Certification and return the form to the Interstate
Commerce Commission. 




Line 4: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where the order for service was signed after the receipt of a written binding
estimate. Include in this computation all so-called hybrid estimates (

e.g.,

 Guaranteed Price and Price Protection options). 

Line 5: Report the total number of C.O.D. shipments where the order for service was signed after the receipt of a written
non-binding estimate. In the case of non-binding estimates, the actual charges are determined after the shipment
has been picked up and weighed. 

Line 6: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where there was no requirement for the preparation of a binding or non-binding
written estimate by the carrier. As with non-binding estimates, the charges here are determined after the shipment
has been picked up and weighed. 

Line 7: Sum of Lines 4, 5, and 6. The number of shipments reported on Line 7 should be the same as those reported in Part
A, Line 1. 



Computation of Percentages or Averages



You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the categories described in Lines 8 and 9, respectively,
and divide these shipments by the number of shipments reported on Lines 4 and 5, respectively. 

You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the categories described in Lines 10 through 16 and
divide these shipments by the number of shipments reported on Line 7. (Exception: Line 13 is an average, not a percentage.)

Line 8: Compute the percentage of those shipments delivered where the final charges exceeded the written estimate
initially provided to the shipper because of changes agreed to by the carrier and shipper in commodities transported
and services provided. 
Line 9: Compute the percentage of those shipments delivered under a non-binding written estimate where the final
charges exceeded the written estimate provided to the shipper by 10% or more. The 10% figure is used because every C.O.D.
shipper is required to have available 110% of the estimate at the time of delivery. 
Line 10: Compute the percentage of those shipments where the actual pickup date occurred after the last date for pickup
promised on the order for service or bill of lading. 
Line 11: Compute the percentage of those shipments where the actual delivery date occurred after the last date for
delivery promised on the order for service or bill of lading. 
Line 12: Compute the percentage of those shipments where there was a claim filed within 60 days of the actual date of
delivery to the residence. Only count those claims where the dollar value of the amount claimed by the shipper exceeded
$200 and resulted from property damaged or lost. This excludes claims for late pickups and deliveries which are reported
on line 13. 
Line 13: Compute the percentage of those shipments where there was a claim filed within 60 days of the actual date of
delivery to the residence. Only count those claims where the dollar value of the amount claimed by the shipper exceeded
$200 and resulted from a late pickup or delivery. Late pickups and deliveries are defined in Instructions 10 and 11.

Line 14: Enter the average number of days required to pay, decline, or make a firm compromise offer of settlement of
all claims exceeding $200 during the report year. For the purpose of this report, a claim shall be considered to be a
``claim filed'' if it meets the criteria set forth in Lines 11 and 12, and shall be considered as paid, declined, or compromised
on the date on which a written offer is mailed or delivered in person to a claimant. 
Line 15: Compute the percentage of the claims exceeding $200 arising out of the transportation of shipments which
were resolved during the report year through the use of a dispute resolution or arbitration procedure maintained
or participated in by the carrier. 
Line 16: Compute the percentage of the claims exceeding $200 arising out of the transportation of shipments which
were resolved during the report year as a result of legal notice of suit to recover being filed by the shipper.

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 HUD is amending the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and 
Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to improve the resistance of manufactured homes to 
wind forces in areas prone to hurricanes. Under this rule, manufactured homes 
will have to be designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 110 miles an hour 
in hurricane-prone areas, in accordance with design provisions of the American 
Society of Civil Engineers Standard ANSI/ASCE 7-88. Also, the Department is 
making certain other changes to the standards to ensure that structural 
assemblies, components, windows, connectors, and fasteners will be adequate 
for the area in which the home is to be placed. The revised standard also 
requires exterior roof and wall coverings to be fastened adequately to 
sheathing and framing members, to resist higher design wind pressures. 



The purpose of this rule is to increase the safety of manufactured 
homes, thereby reducing deaths and injuries and extensive property damage 
losses in areas where wind-induced damage is a particular hazard and risk. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Developmental History 


The purpose of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety 
Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5401-5426, at 5401) (the Act) is to reduce 
the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of insurance costs 
and property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents, and to improve 
the quality and durability of manufactured homes. Section 604 of the Act 
confers authority on the Secretary of HUD to issue, amend, or revoke any 
Federal manufactured home construction or safety standard. 
Following Hurricane Andrew, the Department conducted field 
investigations of the damage experienced in the hurricane by manufactured 
housing units, as part of a full-scale review of the Federal manufactured home 
standards. The goal of these investigations and the review of materials and 
recommendations was to ensure that the Federal standards provide adequate 
protection to manufactured home occupants during high wind conditions. On 
April 14, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 19536) that 
reported the preliminary conclusions of the Department's efforts, and sought 
public comment on changes that the Department was considering for the Federal 
standards. The Department also contacted each of the members of the National 
Manufactured Home Advisory Council (Advisory Council), individually, in order 
to solicit their individual comments on the proposed wind standards rule, 
because the proposed timetable for final publication did not permit convening 
the Advisory Council. The individual responses of the Advisory Council 
members have been considered as public comments and included in the docket 
file for this rule. 
On June 9, 1993, the Department announced (58 FR 32316) that the comment 
period would be extended to July 9, 1993. The Department has continued to 
receive and consider comments well after that date, while this final rule was 
being developed. Because the timeframe originally proposed for the 
implementation of standard changes was postponed as a result of public 
comments and the extension of the comment deadline, the Department consulted 
with the National Manufactured Home Commission and convened the Advisory 
Council for consultation and to seek recommendations from the Advisory Council 
as a whole (see the notice published at 58 FR 34586 (June 28, 1993)). The 
Advisory Council met in Washington, DC, on July 13 and 14, 1993, to discuss 
wind standards and other proposals for changes to the standards for 
manufactured housing.

The recommendations of the Advisory Council as a whole were included in 
a resolution. The resolution questioned the sufficiency of the evidence to 
support adoption of the proposed rule and recommended that: (1) The Department 
undertake negotiated rulemaking or other comparable process for this standard; 
(2) the costs of any rule be considered, both cumulatively and by zones; (3) 
the Department examine its legal and regulatory authority with respect to 
installation, if it finds that an installation standard would be an 
appropriate means of increasing wind safety; (4) the Department consider all 
nationally recognized model codes; (5) the Department make available documents 
relating to the development of new wind standards; (6) the Advisory Council be 
reconvened to review public comments and the Department's analysis; (7) the 
Department should promptly complete the process of updating the wind 
standards, considering the issues and questions raised by the Advisory Council 
and in public comments; and (8) the Department should prepare an adequate 
regulatory impact analysis upon which it can support the decisions to be made 
on implementation of new standards. 
The Department has considered the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Advisory Council in developing this final rule and the final regulatory impact 
analysis. The regulatory impact analysis is responsive to several of the 
Advisory Council's concerns, while this preamble addresses other points raised 
by the Advisory Council. 
With respect to the other points raised by the Advisory Council, many 
commenters also suggested that installation is a crucial factor in the safety 
of manufactured homes. The Department agrees that the installation of 
manufactured housing units may be an important factor in the safety of such 
housing and is initiating a review of the Department's authority and ability 
to influence tiedown requirements. 
However, the Department does not believe there is any significant 
advantage in, or that the public interest would be served by, reconvening the 
Advisory Council for the purpose of reviewing the public comments or the 
Department's compliance with its statutory responsibilities in the development 
of these standards. Nor does the Department believe there is any advantage to 
the public interest in undertaking negotiated rulemaking for these standards 
because they have been subject to an extensive notice and comment period and 
have been discussed with the Advisory Council, a body representative of the 
manufactured housing industry, government, and consumers. 


Major Differences From Proposed Rule 


As a result of the Department's review of public comments and 
consultation with the Advisory Council, at this time the Department has 
decided not to pursue substantial changes to the standards in areas of the 
country not generally subject to hurricanes (Wind Zone I). However, the 
Department recognizes that in many areas of the country the Federal standards 
applicable to the design and construction of manufactured housing are far 
below standards specified for site-built and modular housing by State and 
local codes. Thus, the Department shall initiate a new review of the 
standards for the rest of the country, and it expects to publish proposals for 
these areas next year. 
The Department has also decided not to include in the final rule the 
following items that were in the proposed rule: 
(1) Maximum dimension of 12
'
' for roof overhangs; 
(2) Lower load duration factor than provided in the 1991 National 
Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS); 
(3) Requirement for a 1.5 safety factor to calculate resistance of 
anchoring and foundation systems to higher design forces in Wind Zones II 
and III; 
(4) Manufacturer's design and details for a permanent foundation system 
(certified by a registered professional engineer or architect) applicable to 
each manufactured home design; and 
(5) Shortened period for implementation of the standards after 
publication. 


Relationship to Energy Rule 


On October 25, 1993, the Department published a final rule amending the 
Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to 
include preemptive standards significantly upgrading the existing energy 
conservation requirements (58 FR 54975) (Energy Rule). The effective date of 
that rule is October 25, 1994. 
Several of the provisions to be affected by the Energy Rule are also 
affected by the rule published today. Because of the earlier effective date 
for those provisions in today's rule, the Department will publish technical 
amendments to the Energy Rule, before the effective date of that rule, that 
also will reflect the new requirements imposed under today's rule. In some 
minor instances, the changes adopted in today's rule already include 
requirements that otherwise would have been imposed upon the effective date of 
the Energy Rule. Those changes are identified further in the section-by- 
section analysis later in this preamble. 


Problem To Be Addressed 


Each year significant damage to manufactured housing is produced by 
straight winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Damage is primarily in the form of 
roof failure, loss of roof diaphragm material, connection failures, and 
tiedown/foundation failures. The most predictable areas for wind damage to 
manufactured housing are those subject most directly to hurricanes. Last year 
Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki provided dramatic examples of the destruction 
faced by housing in hurricane-prone areas.

The damage to manufactured homes by Hurricane Andrew was so extensive 
that many were rendered unrecognizable. Ninety-seven percent of all 
manufactured homes in Dade County were totally destroyed, while only eleven 
percent of single-family homes were destroyed. The American Red Cross 
reported that of the 1,176 licensed and registered manufactured homes in 
Homestead, Florida, 1,167 were completely destroyed. The American Red Cross 
and FEMA have also reported a total of 11,213 manufactured homes destroyed in 
Florida and Louisiana in Hurricane Andrew, and an additional 3,016 
manufactured homes experienced major damage. Almost 36% of all housing units 
destroyed during Hurricane Andrew were manufactured homes. 
The loss of these units had implications extending beyond the loss of 
the homes and possessions of their owners. These homes, shredded by the 
winds, also became dangerous flying missiles, inflicting more property damage 
on neighboring structures. 
In its October 1992 report on Hurricane Andrew, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) stated that, ``in all areas, mobile homes 
(manufactured housing) were most susceptible to damage or destruction. Many 
mobile homes imploded from the wind loads of Hurricane Andrew. In coastal 
areas, where mobile homes were properly `cradled' and elevated, the cradled 
foundations remained intact, but the mobile homes mounted to these foundations 
were often heavily damaged or destroyed.'' 
Concerns for potential losses during high winds in coastal and other 
areas were identified previously in a May 1991 report by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA), which predicted that the United States can expect 
more hurricanes of greater intensity during the 1990s and early 2000s than it 
has experienced in recent years. Furthermore, estimates suggest that by the 
year 2010 the population density on Florida's coasts will have increased about 
130 percent from the 1988 level. Moreover, as the national population ages, 
an increasing percentage of coastal inhabitants will probably be older 
individuals, a group more likely to occupy manufactured houses. The American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reports that 40 percent of the 
purchasers of new manufactured homes are at least 50 years old. The elderly 
can be more difficult to evacuate and may be more prone to be injured during 
periods of extreme high winds. 
The technology for achieving economical wind resistant designs in 
housing is available. It involves calculations of risk for extreme wind-prone 
coastal areas and the establishment of construction standards based upon these 
risk calculations. Through use and implementation of this approach, risks of 
injury and death can be minimized and economic loss limited to acceptable 
levels in coastal areas subject to high winds. 
In determining a course of action to address these issues, the 
Department had to balance two competing concerns: (1) The need to raise 
manufactured housing standards, to protect individuals, their homes, and their 
neighbors from future high winds; and (2) the need to preserve the 
affordability of a key source of low-cost housing. This rule is the result of 
the Department's decision to improve protection of homeowners in hurricane- 
prone areas as soon as possible, but to delay making changes to the standards 
in lower wind-risk areas, in order to give adequate consideration to cost 
factors. Although the changes are expected to increase costs to consumers in 
the high-wind areas, the Department has concluded that the increases are 
justified, because the improved standards will significantly reduce future 
losses to occupants and the public by strengthening the features that make 
manufactured homes vulnerable to damage and destruction in high winds. 
Perhaps more importantly, the improved standards may help avoid the 
inestimable costs of devastation to people's lives and emotional health and to 
the communities, in the likelihood that another powerful hurricane hits a 
community of manufactured homes in the hurricane-prone regions of the country. 


Field Investigations_Hurricane Andrew 


Among the major deficiencies contributing to manufactured housing damage 
in Hurricane Andrew were inadequate connections between exterior roof or wall 
coverings and supporting sheathing or framing and between walls, roofs and 
floors. In particular, losses of roof coverings were widespread, and were 
considered by some to be the first mode of failure for manufactured homes 
damaged in Hurricane Andrew. Other roof-related damage was due to loss of 
sheathing, failure of connections, or a combination of these problems. 
Numerous failures of uplift straps also occurred, when the staples pulled out 
through the metal straps, permitting the straps to tear away from the members 
to which they had been fastened. In some cases, entire sections of roofs were 
blown away. 
Another common area of failure was loss of exterior wall siding. Metal 
or plastic siding used in manufactured housing was readily damaged or 
penetrated by flying debris during the high winds in Hurricane Andrew. Loss 
of roof or wall cladding allows the building to be penetrated by the weather 
and has far-reaching consequences beyond the area of envelope integrity. 
As a result of these losses, and damage to windows and doors, there was 
significant water damage and deterioration to many manufactured homes. In 
addition, failure of coverings or attachments to the manufactured home 
structure also caused missile-type damage to other homes.

Other losses were precipitated by prior deterioration around windows and 
doors that had allowed moisture to enter, thereby weakening the resistance of 
surrounding wood framing and floor decking. Apparently this deterioration was 
a result of inadequate design or enforcement practices, or a combination of 
both. In some manufactured homes the loss of opening protection resulted in 
increased internal pressures within the buildings, which contributed to the 
failure of interior components including ceilings. In other cases, entire 
sections of sliding glass doors on leeward walls were literally sucked out of 
their frames because of inadequate resistance of the combined assembly to the 
wind forces imposed during Hurricane Andrew. 
Edges and corners of roofs and endwalls of manufactured homes appeared 
to have been particularly vulnerable to the high wind forces, according to the 
damage typically reported in these areas. Structural failures of endwalls 
also occurred, but the presence of nearby interior shearwalls prevented 
further losses (though not all designs are provided with interior shearwalls 
in the vicinity of the endwall). However, in many other cases, the entire 
superstructure was completely removed from the floor system. 
Numerous anchor system failures were reported in the areas subjected to 
the highest wind speeds. Many of the systems failed due to improper 
installation or the type of anchor used. In addition, anchor capacity 
appeared to have been reduced further because of the saturated condition of 
the soil. 


Summary of NIST Report 


As part of its review of the adequacy of the Federal Manufactured 
Housing Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS), the Department contracted 
for a study by Dr. Richard D. Marshall of the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) [Report NISTIR 5189, May 1993]. According to Dr. 
Marshall and several other investigative reports, damage to manufactured homes 
in Hurricane Andrew ranged from loss of roofing to total destruction. In 
general, HUD-labeled units suffered less damage than did pre-HUD units. 
However, conventional residential construction adjacent to manufactured home 
parks performed better, in some instances significantly better, than did 
manufactured homes. Based on wind speed assessments and damage surveys, it 
appears that HUD-labeled manufactured homes began to experience damage to roof 
and wall coverings at fastest-mile wind speeds of up to 95 mph (43 m/s), and 
significant structural damage at wind speeds of from 100 to 120 mph (45 to 54 
m/s). 
Commonly observed failures included loss of roof membranes and blow-off 
of roof sheathing, failure of uplift straps at truss-to-wall connections where 
staple crowns pulled through the strap, loss of cladding on endwalls and near 
corners where large negative (suction) pressures developed, loss of 
appurtenances with resultant missile damage and damage to the primary house 
unit at connection points, complete separation of the superstructure from the 
floor and chassis frame, and loss of the complete unit because of the failure 
of tiedown straps or the withdrawal of soil anchors. The NIST report also 
pointed out that the capacity of the anchors appeared to have exceeded the 
marginal resistance of the superstructure, and that if the superstructure 
separation failures had not occurred, the number of anchor systems failures 
could have been much more widespread. 
In almost every case in Florida, some form of anchoring had been 
installed. Outside the area of strongest winds, there were relatively few 
anchor failures. Within the radius of strongest winds, anchor failures that 
were observed involved 2 ft. (610 mm) helical ground anchors (some embedded in 
about 3 cu.ft. (0.8 cu.m) of concrete) or rock anchors into coral. No 
failures of 4 ft. (1.2 m) helical anchors were noted. However, it is not 
clear that any anchors of that length were actually installed in the area 
subjected to the highest winds. 
Dr. Marshall of NIST compared wind load provisions of the current FMHCSS 
with the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standard ANSI/ASCE 7-88, 
the South Florida Building Code, the Standard Building Code, and wind design 
provisions proposed by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Based on these 
comparisons of design loads for manufactured housing units of typical 
dimension and geometry, considering the rationale for using importance factors 
and unreduced pressure coefficients, and in view of the fact that it is a true 
consensus standard, Dr. Marshall concluded that ANSI/ASCE
 7-88 should be the 
basis for updating the wind load requirements for manufactured housing. In 
addition, since the NIST study only addressed design loads, in the interest of 
safety and economy, it was also recommended that prescriptive requirements of 
the proposed standard be consistent with the specified design loads and that 
testing and analysis to assure this consistency be conducted. 


ASCE 7-88: Consensus Procedures for Development and Adoption 


The ASCE, founded in 1852, is the oldest civil engineering organization 
in the United States and has a membership of more than 110,000. The ANSI/ASCE 
Standard 7-88, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures 
(November 1990) (ASCE 7-88, in this preamble), was developed by ASCE based on 
studies conducted at academic and research institutions in the United States 
and other parts of the world. 
ASCE 7-88 is the only truly consensus minimum design load standard 
currently available in the United States. The ASCE rules, approved by the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), require all standards committees 
to have a membership balanced between producers, consumers, building 
officials, and general interest groups. Each of these groups represents 
between 20% to 40% of the committee membership. At the time ASCE 7-88 was 
adopted, 89 members were on the standards committee. 
The approval or revision of an ASCE standard is an elaborate process, 
which involves extensive balloting and resolution of all negative votes. When 
a standard is to be adopted, the standards committee is broken down by 
expertise into task committees. Those task committees draft the standard and 
present it to the full standards committee for balloting. All objections 
within the standards committee are satisfied by one of three ways: (1) the 
objector agrees to withdraw the objection; (2) by a vote of 75%, the full 
committee accepts the objection and changes the standard; or (3) by a vote of 
75%, the full committee rejects the objection. The full committee then votes 
on the standard. 
In order for the standard to pass the full standards committee, at least 
65% of the committee membership must vote and 75% of those votes must be in 
the affirmative. Moreover, the affirmative votes cannot be less than 55% of 
the approved voting membership. After the standard passes the standards 
committee, it is issued to the public for further comment. As in the 
standards committee, all objections are individually considered and processed 
in the same manner (i.e., withdrawn or accepted or rejected by a vote of 75% 
of the standards committee). After a certain cutoff date and after all 
objections are addressed, the standard is published as an ASCE consensus 
standard.

ASCE 7-88: Wind Load Provisions in Model Codes 


Building codes in each State or local jurisdiction control the design 
and construction of buildings and structures in that jurisdiction. Most 
communities in the United States adopt, in large part, one of the three model 
building codes: the National Building Code of the Building Officials and Code 
Administrators International (BOCA); the Standard Building Code (SBC) of the 
Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI); or the Uniform 
Building Code (UBC) of International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO). 
Wind load provisions in these model building codes are based on the ASCE 7-88 
standard, but with some modifications. 
The ASCE 7-88 standard considers all of the factors that influence the 
magnitude of wind loads on a building. In addition to wind speed, those 
factors include: (1) Terrain surrounding the building, (2) shape of the 
building, and (3) desired safety of the building frame and components. The 
model building codes use most of these factors from ASCE 7-88, but modify some 
of the factors based on experience; because of tradition, other factors are 
not considered. 
Some provisions of model building codes are adopted from industry 
manuals. The use, adoption, and modification of wind-load factors by the 
model building codes result from an attempt to simplify the wind-load 
provisions and react to the concerns of affected industries and special 
interest groups. In general, these modifications by model code agencies 
result in lower design requirements for wind forces than would be required 
under ASCE 7-88. 
Even with these modifications, final wind loads for most buildings are 
fairly consistent in all model building codes. All three of the major model 
building codes incorporate the basic wind speed map of ASCE 7-88, and 
reference the ASCE standard in whole or in part, but either modify the 
standard or require additional prescriptive design and construction 
provisions. In addition, all three provide the use of ASCE 7-88 as an 
alternative to be applied at the discretion of the designer. 
However, the model building codes do not cover the design or 
construction of manufactured housing. The only control local governments have 
over manufactured housing and mobile (manufactured) home parks is through 
certain zoning regulations, or anchoring, set-up, or installation 
requirements. As noted by one commenter (150) and discussed in the next 
section of this preamble, incorporation of the ASCE 7-88 standard will be 
critical to ensuring continued acceptance of manufactured housing by local 
jurisdictions in high wind areas. 


Building Codes in Southern Florida 


Generally, the local jurisdictions in Florida have adopted modifications 
of the SBC or South Florida Building Code (SFBC). As one of its primary 
recommendations in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the 18-member Dade 
County, Florida, Grand Jury stated that the 35-year-old South Florida Building 
Code must be rewritten to duplicate the tougher, national wind standard of 
ASCE 7-88. The Grand Jury recognized ASCE 7-88 as a standard that more 
adequately reflects the design strength necessary for windows and doors. In 
acknowledgment of the Grand Jury's recommendations, the Dade County Building 
Code Committee adopted (effective January 1, 1994) the Wind Loads section of 
ASCE 7-88, using Exposures C and D, only. The Grand Jury further recommended 
that Dade County officials issue a moratorium on the permanent replacement of 
manufactured homes until officials could be assured that the replacement homes 
meet the ASCE 7-88 standards. Further, noting that lower standards are 
applied to manufactured housing than to conventional housing, the 1992 Fall 
Term Grand Jury asserted that ``the low standard amounted to discrimination 
against those persons unable to afford the costs of conventional housing.'' 
In its Final Report, filed August 4, 1993, the Dade County Grand Jury 
referenced the initial Grand Jury findings regarding the engineering 
advantages of the ASCE 7-88 standard and commended its adoption into the SFBC. 
The Grand Jury reported that: 



[T]his additional and essential modification of the SFBC should 
provoke a wide-ranging improvement of most of our building 
designs, methods and products. It should also result in the 
building of structures that will provide greater safety and 
security during a hurricane. 




In order to protect those living in and near manufactured homes, the Grand 
Jury has reiterated the recommendation that a moratorium be instituted on the 
installation in the County of any new mobile homes that do not meet the wind-loading standards of ASCE 7-88. 


In addition, the SBCCI, after assessing the damage caused by Hurricane 
Andrew, concluded that standards applicable to manufactured housing need to be 
reviewed to bring them up to the level of other construction types, unless 
society is willing to consider manufactured homes to be expendable. The SBCCI 
said that even if manufactured homes are considered expendable, the issue of 
the hazard they present to neighboring buildings and structures needs to be 
addressed. Accordingly, they further concluded that steps need to be taken to 
strengthen the structural frame, enforce tiedown provisions, and assure that 
the installation of homes is done by those who are knowledgeable in the 
requirements of the code. Unless these issues are addressed, the SBCCI 
believes there will continue to be great costs associated with hurricane 
damage. 


Improved Anchoring and Foundation Systems 


Enforcement of anchoring and tie-down systems for manufactured housing 
construction has generally been considered a State or local government and 
their building officials' responsibility. Section 3282.303 of the 
Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282) 
urges, but does not require, State Administrative Agencies to monitor 
installation of manufactured homes. Thus, standards for foundations and 
anchorings and enforcement of those standards are not uniform among the 
States, and in some States are nonexistent. For example, the State of Florida 
has statewide laws related to installation, but enforcement of those laws is 
left to local building officials, while Louisiana is one of 23 States that 
does not regulate installation of manufactured homes at all.

The National Conference of Building Codes and Standards (NCSBCS), under 
contract with the Department, sent a team to inspect manufactured homes 
damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. Their report, dated September 25, 
1992 (Rev. October 1, 1992), evaluated anchoring systems used in Florida and 
Louisiana. The team found that virtually all manufactured homes they saw in 
Florida had been anchored, but anchors had failed in most destroyed homes. 
Some of the systems that failed were anchors embedded only two feet into 
the soil, which were pulled out of the ground by the force of the storm. 
Other systems that failed included short anchors embedded in concrete or 
driven into the coral. In Louisiana, most manufactured homes the team saw had 
no anchoring systems at all, or only had two or three anchors on each side; 
less than one-half the number generally specified by manufacturers' 
instructions for hurricane zones. Also, where anchors were installed, most 
had been installed incorrectly; often embedded only partially in the ground 
with 12
'
' or more protruding above finished grade. 
While the majority of anchoring system failures appeared to result from 
improper installation, the NCSBCS Team observed several cases where the 
holding capacity of anchors appeared to have been reduced because of water 
saturated soil. In order to determine the adequacy of anchoring systems 
installed in soil that might be exposed to heavy rainfall and hurricane force 
winds, further investigating and testing of anchors will be conducted by the 
Department. 
Numerous failures reported after Hurricanes Andrew and Hugo and other 
previous wind storms support the Department's concerns over anchoring systems 
for manufactured housing that are inadequate to resist probable high wind 
forces. In addition, as the NIST Report indicated: ``[i]f superstructure 
failures had not occurred [in Hurricane Andrew], the number of anchor system 
failures might well have been greater  * * *.'' 
Some field and laboratory testing of commercially available ground 
anchor and steel strapping systems has been conducted under a HUD contract 
with Wiss, Janney, & Elstner, Inc. (See WJE Report No. 901798, July 26, 1991, 
HUD USER_HUD-0005823). The initial test results indicate that anchors have 
a significantly lower load resistance capacity than even the levels required 
by the current standard. Resistance or capacity would be even lower if 
anchors are not installed in accordance with anchor manufacturer's and home 
manufacturer's installation instructions or under saturated soil conditions. 
The Department has also been conducting laboratory tests to evaluate the 
resistance of manufactured home support and anchoring systems to lateral wind 
and seismic forces. After the results of the laboratory data have been 
evaluated and compared to the field data, the Department may propose changes 
to lower allowable anchor system resistance values. 
In the interim, the Department cautions home and anchor manufacturers, 
installers, retailers, insurance companies, lenders, and State and local 
government agencies that anchoring should be rated for specific soil, loading, 
and installation conditions for which the anchor is acceptable. Failure to do 
so may result in anchoring and tiedown systems which have inadequate ultimate 
capacity to resist probable design wind forces. 


II. Analysis of Public Comments 


Characterization of Commenters 


The Department received 1,116 comments in response to the proposed rule 
and the notice extending the comment period. Although approximately 235 of 
these comments are included in file of the Rules Docket Clerk as being 
received under the extended deadline, many of these were delayed in receipt in 
the Rules Docket Clerk office because they were sent first to other offices 
within the Department. 
The great majority of the comments were duplicative or identical form 
letters (of the 1,116 total comments, only 75 to 100 included distinctive 
comments). The commenters generally can be characterized as follows:

 

_ Businesses (including retailers, manufacturers, 
suppliers, finance companies, park owners, etc.)_704
_Industry groups (including State and national 
associations)_24
_Members of Congress (including original 
correspondence and transmittals of constituent letters)_245
_Other governmental agencies and representatives 
(Federal, State, and local agencies or representatives)_27
_Members of the National Manufactured Home Advisory 
Council (individually)_15
_Individuals (including consumers, engineers and 
other experts, salespersons, etc., in individual capacities)_80
_Private standards groups_6
_Consumer groups_2
_Tenants groups_1
_Insurance industry_3
_National Commission on Manufactured Housing_1
_DAPIA (Design Approval Primary Inspection Agency)_2
_Correspondence forwarded from White House_2
_Law firms_3
_Other national associations_1

 

Many of the comments received by the Department and addressed in the 
following discussion were common to numerous commenters. Other less universal 
comments addressed in the discussion may be referenced by number in 
parentheses following a statement. These numbers correspond to the number

Comments, Generally 


A number of commenters acknowledged the need to update the Department's 
standards for manufactured housing. One commenter (77) welcomed the better 
publicity and reputation the industry would enjoy as a result of updated 
standards. However, many of these commenters also stated opposition to the 
specific standards proposed by the Department. 
About two dozen commenters, including consumer and insurance industry 
groups, standards organizations, government agencies, and engineers, generally 
supported the basic standard proposed (e.g., 17, 55, 76, 137, 145, 150, 197, 
633, 12

(2)

, 204

, 207

), although several of these commenters also expressed concern about specific cost items. Supporting comments emphasized
the importance of affordable, safe housing, rather than merely affordable housing (17), and characterized ASCE
7-88 as the only consensus wind standard in the Country (76, and others). 


Procedural Comments 




Comment

: The 30-day comment period allowed in the proposed rule did not permit sufficient consideration of the rule and development
of public 
comments. In addition, the justification for the shortened effective date 
that the proposed rule had indicated would apply to the final rule was not 
justified by the need to implement regulatory changes before the 1993 
hurricane season. 


Response

: Because of the numerous requests for longer response periods from both the public and members of Congress, and because
it was apparent that a rule could not be in place in time for the 1993 hurricane season, the Department has allowed additional
time for public comments and implementation of the final rule. The proposed rule was published on April 14, 1993, and
the comment period was extended to July 9, 1993. 
Because of the Department's desire to consider the full extent of public 
response on this rule, the Department has continued to receive comments 
regularly while the final rule and regulatory impact analysis were being 
prepared and has continued to log and review those comments. Therefore, in 
effect, the comment period for this rule has been approximately 5 months. 
To alleviate the concerns relating to the industry's need for ample time 
to redesign homes and retool manufacturing facilities, the Department has 
decided to extend the effective date originally proposed for this rule. 
Accordingly, the rule provides for an effective date of, at least, 180 days 
from today's date of publication. Thus, the concerns of the commenters in 
these regards have been addressed by the Department.

Comment

: The National Manufactured Housing Advisory Council should be convened, as required by law, to consider the standards
proposed by the 
Department. 


Response

: Despite the infeasibility of convening the Advisory Council within the timeframe originally proposed for the implementation
of improved standards, the Department made an extraordinary effort to consult with the individual members of the
Advisory Council. The responses of a number of the individual members of the Advisory Council have been considered
and included in the docket file for this rulemaking. 
Later, because of the Department's extension of the comment period and 
recognition that a final rule could not be in place in time for the 1993 
hurricane season, the Department immediately convened the Advisory Council so 
that it could discuss the proposal as a panel. The resulting recommendations 
of the Advisory Council, as a panel, also have been considered carefully in 
determining both the scope and the specific requirements of this final rule. 
Additional discussion of the proceedings of the Advisory Council can be found 
elsewhere in this preamble. 


Comment

: Several commenters questioned the impact of the rule on 
families, in the context of Executive Order 12606, which requires 
consideration of the impact of a regulation on family formation, maintenance, 
and general well-being. 


Response

: In the proposed rule, the Department indicated that the rule was not subject to review under the Executive Order.
The commenters 
questioned this position based on information that some potential consumers 
would be unable to purchase manufactured homes if the prices of those homes 
were raised to cover the costs of the new standards. To the extent that 
production cost increases resulting from this rule will be passed on to 
consumers, one effect of the rule is expected to be the loss of marginal 
consumers from the market. Some of these marginal consumers will have to find 
less expensive, rental housing; some will opt for comparably priced site-built 
housing. However, the significance of this result is not a loss of housing, 
but a redistribution of the kinds of housing available. Although as a result 
some families may lose an ownership option, the general well-being of 
families, and society, is served better by ensuring adequate quality standards 
for such housing. 
Although the Department does not believe this final rule implicates 
family concerns within the spirit of the Executive Order, the Department has 
analyzed the rule as required under the Order. Therefore, in the paragraph on 
Executive Order 12606 under the ``Other Matters'' section of this preamble, the Department certifies that the requirements
of the Order have been met in the issuance of this rule. 


Comment

: The proposed rule indicated that manufacturers should 
anticipate the contents of the final rule and should prepare to comply with 
the more stringent standards soon after publication of the final rule. This 
schedule for implementation of the new standards fails to recognize the need 
for lead time to design, test, and seek approval of changes necessitated by 
the standard changes. In addition, while personnel resources are concentrated 
on the redesign requirement, production personnel may have to be laid off. 
This problem is compounded by the possibility that another redesign will be 
necessary as a result of the new Federal energy standards. 


Response

: To a large extent, the Department already has been responsive to the concerns expressed in this comment by conceding
that the rule will not become effective for 180 days. The Department is sensitive to the procedural requirements that
a manufacturer faces when undertaking design changes. However, there is no doubt that by the time this rule becomes
effective, all aspects of the industry should have had sufficient advance notice of the necessary product improvements
to prepare for implementation of the new standards. 
Innovative solutions and safer products generally depend on some 
commercial incentive. The Department believes, based on the knowledge of its 
technical staff, the reports they have reviewed, and some of the comments 
received, that those parties involved in the production, sales, and siting of 
manufactured housing will be able to comply with these standards reasonably 
quickly, when continued sales depend on such compliance. 


Cost Considerations 




Comment

: The cost impact of the standard changes should be analyzed, as required by Executive Order 12291 and 42 U.S.C. 5403(f),
and a regulatory 
impact analysis should be prepared. 


Response

: As stated in the ``Other Matters'' section of the preamble of the proposed rule (57 FR 19539), the Department agreed
that it would prepare and submit a regulatory impact analysis before publication of the final rule, in accordance
with established Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. Although many of the benefits, and some costs, of
increased standards are difficult to quantify for purposes of such an economic analysis (e.g., loss of life, uninsured
costs, insurance deductibles, and injuries), the Department has complied with the requirements of Executive Order
12866 (September 30, 1993) and OMB. As noted under ``Significant Regulatory Action'' in the ``Other Matters'' section
of this preamble, a final regulatory analysis based on the provisions in this final rule is available to the public.

However, while economic concerns have always been an important component 
of the Department's decisionmaking process and, in this case, resulted in 
modification of the rule, the Department stresses that its statutory mandate 
to reduce the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of 
insurance costs and property damage resulting from manufactured home 
accidents, and to improve the quality and durability of manufactured homes, 
requires that the Department look beyond affordability issues. In promoting 
homeownership opportunities for lower-income persons, the Department strongly 
believes that such housing must also be safe. The concern with safety extends 
beyond the occupants of the housing, to all those who may be affected by the 
failure of such housing to meet minimum performance standards under reasonably 
foreseeable conditions. For example, in a Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) report on ``Building Performance: Hurricane Andrew in Florida'' (FIA-22, 2/93), cited by commenter
76,

 

It was observed that the breakup of corrugated metal siding and 
roofed buildings such as manufactured homes and pre-engineered 
metal frame buildings contributed significantly to the generation 
of airborne debris. This was evident from debris damage to nearby 
downwind structures.

 


As stated by another commenter (205

(2)

): ``The prospect of reducing the loss of life and property and reducing the cost of disaster relief efforts from such
losses as Hurricane Andrew would certainly be to the benefit of the entire housing industry and the individual and
corporate citizen taxpayers of the United States.'' In addition, the upgrades required under this rule also would
increase the ability of the homes to withstand damage during transportation and installation of the units, and the
improved windows would be more energy efficient (see comment 150).

The Department recognizes the viability of manufactured housing as a source of affordable housing for many people
and will continue to work with the industry to ensure a quality product at a reasonable cost. However, the Department
will also continue to exercise all of its statutory responsibilities relating to housing and its occupants in a manner
that serves the optimal societal interests. This final rule is evidence that the Department agrees with those commenters
that said the savings in storm damage repair, loss of personal property, and potential personal injury or loss of life,
in addition to other expected benefits, exceeds the cost differential for these new standards. The Department has
also reviewed cost impact figures provided by numerous commenters during the development of the final regulatory
impact analysis.



Comment:

 The increased cost of manufactured housing that will be the result of the more stringent standards may price many consumers
out of the market for unsubsidized housing. A home manufactured to the new standards will require a higher downpayment,
and potential consumers will find it more difficult to qualify for financing. The level of regulation proposed would
limit consumer choice and would deny consumers the right to match housing to their budgets (1).



Response:

 The Department is concerned about the effect of these standards on the ability of consumers to afford and purchase
manufactured housing. However, because the standards are, for the most part, performance standards and do not prescribe
methods of construction, the manufactured housing industry can, and the Department expects will, approach this
problem by developing innovative designs, components, and construction techniques that meet the standards but
maintain the affordability of manufactured homes. The Department has also removed some of the proposed prescriptive
requirements. These changes from the proposed rule should help maintain the affordability of manufactured housing
while still assuring safety.

As stated by one commenter (215

(2)

), sacrificing a minimum reasonable wind standard for manufactured housing so that it can be more affordable makes
as much sense as allowing a car to be sold without brakes for the same reason. A similar opinion was expressed by a consumer,
who commented (117

(2)

):




If tougher standards increase the cost of a mobile home by a fair percentage I believe people will be willing to pay a
little more for better protection. Most of these homes are not second homes but the principal residence of retirees.




Earlier in the preamble the Department acknowledges the legitimate concern with affordability, but also notes the
importance of safe housing that protects other societal interests.



Conversely, as noted by commenter 145 (FEMA), ``[t]he disruption of lives and families resulting from the damage
to manufactured housing often happens to those least able to fully recover.'' Therefore, the financial impact of
insufficient standards also may fall most heavily on those least able to absorb that impact. The Department agrees
with commenter 215

(2)

 that the poor should not have to accept a lower safety factor against catastrophic failure of housing than the rest
of society.

Finally, a commenter representing a number of insurance carriers (17) noted that builder/developer estimates of
cost increases for building code improvements for site-built structures have far exceeded documented incremental
cost increases in the past. The commenter observed that cost estimates with respect to manufactured housing and the
higher standards proposed by the Department may contain similar exaggerations. This possibility is discussed by
the Department in the regulatory impact analysis prepared in connection with this final rule.



Comment:

 In looking at storm damage estimates for purposes of a cost-benefit analysis, the Department should distinguish
damage to manufactured homes that complied with existing HUD standards from damage to pre-HUD homes.



Response:

 As previously discussed, both manufactured homes built before the imposition of HUD standards and those built after
the standards became effective experienced significant damage during Hurricane Andrew. Therefore, the numerical
breakdown between pre- and post-HUD standards is not a determinative factor in the Department's process with respect
to the final content of this rule.

However, in its comments on this rule, the AARP (commenter 

#

150) noted that ``[w]hile more than half of the manufactured homes destroyed were built prior to implementation of
the HUD standards, many of these older homes were constructed in accordance with American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) Standard A119.1, which had the same wind load resistance requirements as the current HUD standards.''



Comment:

 As a practical matter, manufacturers will build their homes to the most stringent standards that would apply to their
sales areas. Therefore, those manufacturers that would build homes for more than one zone will build all their homes
to accommodate the highest wind load requirements, and the cost of compliance with the new standards will actually
be higher than the estimates that are based on numbers of units per Zone (12).



Response:

 The Department does not discourage voluntary compliance with standards that are higher than those required. However,
the Department believes that the decision to comply voluntarily with higher standards will be controlled by the cost
of such compliance and the manufacturer's market demands. Accordingly, such compliance is questionable and cannot
be considered in the regulatory impact analysis.



Comment:

 The implementation of new standards will adversely affect the marketability of existing homes not built to those
standards (87), leading to increased defaults and credit losses (139).



Response:

 The standards implemented by this rule will not affect manufactured homes already occupied by consumers. Thus, the
resale market for these existing units generally should not be affected, except to the extent that prospective purchasers
have the financial resources, realize the construction limitations of the existing units, and choose to purchase
units meeting the new standard or other housing options. Because prospective purchasers of used manufactured housing
are likely to be in lower income brackets, however, the Department expects little or no impact on the resale market
for manufactured homes already occupied by consumers.

Comment:

 The additional cost attributable to increased costs for lumber is of particular concern (639).



Response:

 As noted above, the Department is concerned about all additional costs and the affordability of homes constructed
to the new standards. Any specific concern with lumber costs has been alleviated because of recent changes in market
conditions, which have shown that high prices being charged for lumber earlier this year were an aberration. Lumber
costs have significantly reduced since original cost estimates were prepared. In addition, the final rule will permit
the use of the 1991 NDS without exception, which lowers earlier manufactured housing industry projections of the
lumber changes and estimated costs for complying with the new standards.



Scope of Requirements





Comment:

 The prescriptive standards in the proposed rule would eliminate the ability of manufacturers to be innovative in
developing safer and more attractive homes.



Response:

 A number of the prescriptive standards in the proposed rule have been removed in the final rule. For those that remain,
manufacturers can utilize 24 CFR 3282.14, to take advantage of the Department's policy encouraging innovation through
alternative construction.



Comment:

 Because the proposed rule was largely justified as a response to damages incurred in hurricane-prone areas, the standards
and time frames contained in the proposed rule should not be applied to other zones subject to lower wind speeds.



Response:

 At this time the Department has deleted the proposed changes to Zone I from the final rule. Therefore, homes designated
to be sited in Zone I must comply with the previous wind standard for those areas. However, many commenters and the Advisory
Council indicated that the Department should strive to bring the Federal standards to a level of comparability with
conventional housing standards. The Department will review existing wind standards in the remaining areas of the
country for possible future action.



Choice of Standard





Comment:

 The Department has not demonstrated that ASCE 7-88 is the appropriate standard to be adopted for the higher wind
loading requirements. For example, the Standard Building Code may be a more appropriate standard for the purposes
of this rule.



Response:

 A number of engineers have written in support of the ASCE 7-88 standard, noting that the standard was developed
based on scientific studies performed in wind tunnels, which were subsequently verified by tests on full-scale structures.
By adopting the Southern Florida Building Code (SFBC), which incorporates the Standard Building Code, the people
of south Florida thought they were protected by one of the toughest building codes, with respect to wind. However,
the wind load requirements of the SFBC now have been surpassed by other codes that are based on recent research. For
example, the SFBC does not reflect peak gusts or use pressure coefficients as high as are now considered suitable.
As a result, the SFBC design wind speed of 120 mph would only correspond to a design wind speed of less than 100 mph for
many elements of the construction. As previously noted in this preamble, Dade County has adopted (effective January
1, 1994) the wind loads section of ASCE 7-88, using Exposures C and D, only.



Comment:

 No model code has adopted the ASCE 7-88 standard. The Department does not justify its attempt to impose more stringent
standards for manufactured housing than are applied to site-built homes. It is an abuse of Federal authority to impose
standards that go well beyond any State building code currently in existence (87).



Response:

 The relationship between the model codes and ASCE 7-88 is discussed earlier in the preamble in the section on
Development and Adoption of ASCE 7-88. In addition, the Department notes that the ASCE 7-88 standard already
is incorporated into its Minimum Property Standards (24 CFR part 200, subpart S), which apply to certain site-built
housing within the Department's jurisdiction.

The current wind load requirements for manufactured housing for high wind zones correspond to a wind speed of 80 mph;
other types of housing are subject to much higher design wind speed requirements in the same high wind areas. Therefore,
as noted by the AARP in its comments (150), adoption of ASCE 7-88 actually will ensure substantial equivalence
of wind design requirements between manufactured and site-built housing.

Furthermore, Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties in Florida have adopted ASCE 7-88 (with the 110 mph wind
load) for site-built homes, and the Department believes other coastal jurisdictions will follow. Model codes also
have adopted or are moving toward the adoption of the ASCE 7-88 standard. In fact, by not including the higher
standards for the remainder of the country (Zone I), a majority of manufactured homes produced in this country will
comply to a standard well below the building codes currently in existence for site-built housing.



Comment:

 The Department should recognize ``deemed-to-comply'' standards.



Response:

 The Department considered the deemed-to-comply standards, but determined that a performance standard would allow
manufacturers flexibility to be innovative in their approach to compliance with the standards. Such innovation
will reduce the cost associated with strict adherence to the deemed-to-comply standards.



Comment:

 The rule expands the ASCE 7-88 definition of ``components and cladding'' to include exterior coverings and
fastenings, and the limited availability of these materials may make compliance difficult (221).



Response:

 The Department has made alternative provisions in the standard for adequate resistance of exterior coverings to
specified design wind pressure requirements.



Enforcement





Comment:

 The proposed rule did not address testing issues. The Department does not specify whether the proposed structural
design changes have been subjected to destruction testing. (144) Although there is no agreement on a testing protocol,
truss suppliers will need time to retest their many truss designs. (8, 16, and incorporated by reference in others)
The need to test many types of siding, siding gauges (thicknesses), and accessories, fasteners, and fastener patterns
also may lead to tooling changes, which will require more time. (9)



Response:

 Testing will continue to be evaluated under the DAPIA review process, which is not revised by this rule. However, the
Department has extended, to 180 days (or, for some provisions, one year) from today's publication of the rule, the
implementation schedule for the new requirements, in order to give producers sufficient time to comply with the standards.



Comment:

 The existence of multiple wind zones and corresponding requirements within a single State creates difficulties
with respect to enforcement, as well as with production. It is not clear who bears the responsibility for monitoring
the placement of homes within a wind zone for which they are intended (87, 91, 92, 610).

<PARENT> FR940114-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 The Department appreciates the difficulties of enforcing the 
standards when multiple zones exist in a single State. Accordingly, the 
Department has specifically listed those local governments in the higher wind 
zones in each State. Depending on the facts surrounding the sale of a 
manufactured home, both the manufacturer and the dealer will be responsible 
for assuring that the home will be in compliance with the standards by siting 
the home in the proper zone. The State Administrative Agencies (SAAs) will be 
informed of the changes resulting from this rule and will assist the 
Department in discovering homes that are sited in noncompliance with these 
standards. 


Anchoring and Tie-Downs 




Comment:

 The change in lease communities could be revolutionary, as 
homes become more permanent in nature (122) and homes are taxed more as real, 
rather than personal, property. Generally, lessors are required to restore 
the site to its original condition when they move. This requirement, and the 
relocation of utility connections, would be made more difficult with more 
permanent foundations. In addition, the FHA Title II allowance for 
installation would not be sufficient for the additional costs of permanent 
foundations (146, and others). 


Response:

 The Department has evaluated these comments and has removed 
the design requirement for a permanent foundation. However, the Department 
remains concerned that some form of strengthened tiedown system may be 
necessary to protect homes adequately in high wind areas. Thus, the 
Department will be reviewing the issue of permanent foundations and other 
strengthened anchoring systems in conjunction with regulatory action on wind 
resistant design and construction requirements for the remainder of the 
country. 


Comment:

 The impact of the new Wind Standards can be adversely effected 
if there is inadequate enforcement and monitoring of the placement of homes to 
assure that only homes that have been designed for the wind load requirements 
of the Zone are permitted to be sited. There is a need for better local 
inspection; the home is only as good as its anchoring system (149). There is 
compelling evidence that much of the damage from Hurricane Andrew was 
attributable to the lax enforcement of State and local building codes, 
including anchoring requirements, rather than to inadequate standards (80, 
122). Similarly, the main problem with manufactured homes is the proper 
installation of anchoring equipment, which the Department cannot regulate 
(100). 


Response:

 Although the use of tiedowns was widespread in the areas 
affected by Hurricane Andrew, indicating some attempt to comply with codes, 
the tiedowns generally performed very poorly. None of the tiedowns observed 
was certified in accordance with code requirements. The Department is 
reviewing the authority to regulate installation of manufactured homes and is 
exploring ways to encourage States and localities to adopt and enforce more 
stringent anchoring requirements. The Department also is reviewing 
appropriate methods, including a disclosure requirement, to inform consumers 
about the installation of the home in a manner that achieves the highest wind 
protection performance for the home's design. 
Meanwhile, the Department will be contacting the Governors of all 
States, and in particular States where the wind risk is the greatest, to 
advise the Governors of the changes in the wind standards and the need for 
each State to establish installation standards and a system of enforcement and 
monitoring. 


Comment:

 Typical ground anchors performed adequately in Hurricane 
Andrew (14

(2)

-17

(2)

, 73

(2)

, 88

(2)

, and others). If given enough time, ground 
anchor manufacturers can develop an anchoring system that is comparable to a 
permanent foundation system (29). 


Response:

 With very few exceptions, manufactured homes in the path of 
Hurricane Andrew were destroyed by the resulting wind forces. The lack of 
adequate attachment of single or double-wide units to ground anchors was a 
major factor in loss of units. The chassis of some units could be found some 
distance away from their original site. However, in some cases the anchors 
did hold the floor of the unit down while the ``box'' of the structure was torn 
away by the high winds. For this reason, there is justification for 
increasing the strength of the structure by this final rule. 
The effective date of these new requirements will now be at least 180 
days from today. The Department agrees that innovative anchoring systems 
comparable to permanent foundations systems can be developed; however, anchor 
manufacturers are cautioned regarding the resistance capacity of auger-type 
anchors presently used for installing manufactured homes, when those anchors 
are subject to high winds and ensuing saturated soil conditions. The 
Department's tests show substantially less resistance than required by 24 CFR 
3280.306(f), even when tested under dry soil conditions. 


Comment:

 Substantially increased siting requirements would be a problem 
especially for retirees in land-lease communities and for minority owners who 
reside on ``heir property'' and cannot secure clear title to their site (672). 


Response:

 Alternative anchoring systems that are expected to provide 
the required resistance to high wind forces are already available in the 
market. The Department believes that if siting requirements are increased by 
State and local governments, the manufactured housing industry will likely 
develop ways to accommodate siting in land-lease communities.

Technical Comments 




Comment:

 The Department has not justified its proposal to require a lower load duration factor for designing wood members and
fastenings to resist wind forces than is specified in the 1991 edition of the National Design Specification for Wood
Construction (NDS) published by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). 


Response:

 The Department agrees that the higher factor of 1.6 in the NDS has been justified by research completed by AFPA for wood
members subjected to short duration loads of 10 minutes or less. This is generally recognized as the maximum period
for exposure of structures to wind forces. In addition, the 1991 NDS has already been adopted without exception by
certain model code agencies. However, cyclic testing to evaluate fasteners and connectors has not yet been completed.
Preliminary results suggest that a higher load duration factor may be appropriate. Therefore, the Department will
accept the higher load duration factor of 1.6 on an interim basis and will recognize the 1991 NDS without exception
in this final rule. The Department intends to monitor this research and may propose a different load duration factor
for fasteners and connectors in the future, subject to the research and test results. 


Comment:

 There is no basis for the 12'' limitation and prescriptive requirements for eave and cornice projections; their implementation
would inhibit design innovations. 


Response:

 While longer eave and overhang projections will subject trusses, fasteners, and connectors to significant increases
in design loads, and thereby increase their likelihood of failure under extreme wind conditions, the Department
agrees that the provision should be removed because it does restrict innovation, and truss and home manufacturers
are capable of designing roof systems and connections to resist the higher wind forces. However, manufacturers that
use larger projections than 12 inches are cautioned to review their designs carefully to assure that all components
and fastenings are adequate to resist the design pressures specified in ASCE 7-88 or the table in  3280.304.



Comment:

 The prescriptive requirements for sidewall-to-roof and floor connections using steel strapping or brackets should
be replaced with performance criteria that permit the use of alternative methods of connection, such as structural
sheathing that overlaps the roof and floor. 


Response:

 In general, the Department agrees that the use of performance-based standards is preferred. However, on-site investigations
of the damage from Hurricane Andrew revealed that current designs using 30 gage straps failed. Based on the above information,
the Department has retained the prescriptive requirement for strapping in high wind areas, but will permit to be used
a combination of strapping and structural sheathing that overlaps the roof or floor, instead of only steel straps
or brackets, provided the sheathing and its fastenings are demonstrated by calculations or tests to have equivalent
strength and resistance to the design wind uplift forces. 


Comment:

 The use of the 1.5 factor of safety for design of anchoring systems is not consistent with ASCE 7-88. 


Response:

 The Department concurs that there is no provision in the ASCE 7-88 standard for increasing the wind pressures
for the design of anchoring systems to resist overturning and sliding forces. Therefore, the anchoring design provisions
for Wind Zones II and III, which are based on the ASCE 7-88 requirements, will not require the application of the
1.5 factor of safety to be applied to the design wind drag and uplift pressures. However, the 1.5 factor of safety will
continue to be required for calculating the required resistance of anchoring systems for Wind Zone I, since the design
lateral and uplift wind forces remain based on the current standard, which is lower than all model building codes.



Comment:

 The Department should clarify whether new wind uplift design loads in the Table (in  3280.305) are gross or net
uplift loads. 


Response:

 The uplift wind loads in the table are the full or ``gross'' loads. Gravity or dead loads may be deducted from these loads
when calculations are prepared using the design pressures in the table. 


Comment:

 Existing truss testing procedures in  3280.402(c)(2) should be clarified as to: (1) The acceptability of existing
inverted truss testing procedures for evaluating new wind uplift design loads; (2) whether vertical live and gravity
roof load testing must still be conducted with trusses in the upright position when uplift forces are higher than downward
loads; and (3) whether eave loads are to be applied simultaneously with roof uplift loads. 


Response:

 (1) The inverted test method may continue to be used on an interim basis while the Department evaluates results of an
industry study to compare results of the existing test method, which applies load to the bottom chord of the truss,
to results obtained from applying the load to the top chord of the truss. (2) Testing must continue to be conducted in
the upright position, because the loads are applied to different members (chords) of the truss. (3) Uplift loads are
to be applied to truss eave projections when uplift loads are applied to the truss bottom chords during each loading
phase required by  3280.402(c)(2). 


Comment:

 A new provision should be added requiring a professional engineer to prepare and certify wind load designs and calculations.

Response: 

The Department will consider this suggestion for future 
rulemaking on wind load requirements. 


Comment: 

Special standards should be required for asphalt shingle 
performance in high wind areas, because of the large number of failures that 
occurred in Hurricane Andrew and ensuing structural and water damage caused by 
these failures. 


Response: 

The asphalt shingle industry research is not yet completed in 
this area. As an interim step, this final rule requires each shingle to be 
secured with two additional fasteners and underlayment to be cemented to the 
roof decking. 


Comment: 

Testing requirements should be specified for windows and doors 
to avoid missile damage in high winds. Safety standards can be enhanced 
without affecting affordability, by requiring operating shutters and proper 
anchoring (88

(2)

). 


Response: 

The Department encourages manufacturers to provide shutters 
or protective devices for homes in Wind Zones II and III. Under this rule 
manufacturers will be required, at a minimum, to provide instructions for an 
appropriate method of shutter or cover installation to protect the home, and 
to include shutter information on the data plate. The instructions must 
provide a method for protecting the windows and doors that is capable of 
withstanding design wind pressures without taking the home out of conformance 
with the standards. The application of shutters does not do away with the 
need for testing the doors or windows they protect. 


Comment: 

A requirement should be added for the use of perforated metal 
straps at the marriage line of the roof, between sections of doublewides, to 
transfer wind forces from the windward to the leeward side of the roof. 


Response: 

As part of its continuing evaluation of wind design 
requirements, the Department will assess the merits of this proposal. 


Comment: 

The Department needs to establish standards to regulate the 
addition of appurtenances to manufactured homes, such as porches, carports, 
and canopies, which experienced a large number of failures in Hurricane 
Andrew. The danger to occupants is further increased because the rule does 
not address the effect of dangerous appurtenances (52, 65, 122). 


Response: 

Under 24 CFR 3282.8(j) the standards currently do not govern 
add-ons, as long as the add-on doesn't affect the ability of the home to 
comply with the standards. However, as noted in that section, the Secretary 
has authority to promulgate standards for some add-ons. Accordingly, the 
Department is examining its authority in this area and may establish 
requirements in the future. In the interim, HUD encourages all States to 
establish standards covering the construction and attachment of these kinds of 
appurtenances to manufactured homes. 


Comment: 

Exposure D in ASCE 7-88 should be used for coastal shoreline 
areas. 


Response: 

Under this rule manufacturers are required to include on the 
data plate a statement that units designed to meet the minimum standards in 
this rule should not be located within 1500 feet of the coastline in Zones II 
and III. By this statement, the consumer is alerted that only units designed 
and anchored according to the higher design standards specified for coastal 
areas in ASCE 7-88 should be placed along the coastline. 


Comment: 

``Wind safety'' is a misnomer; the science of weather 
forecasting allows ample notice of dangerous storms to permit evacuation (296-314). Homeowner safety is better
served by evacuation in high winds than from 
protection afforded by the manufactured home structure. If a manufactured 
home is purported to be designed and constructed to withstand higher wind 
speeds, occupants may be less likely to evacuate the homes at the approach of 
a dangerous storm. 


Response: 

The Department agrees that if it is safe to do so, 
homeowners should attempt to reach a shelter capable of resisting high winds. 
However, without the imposition of these enhanced Wind Safety Standards, the 
numbers of deaths and injuries attributable to the inadequate performance of 
manufactured homes in high winds will continue unabated. In addition to 
reducing deaths and injuries, the Department's statutory responsibilities 
require the implementation of higher wind standards to reduce the insurance 
cost and amount of property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents 
and improvement of the quality and durability of manufactured homes. The 
Department believes that these higher wind standards will fulfill those 
responsibilities. 


Comment: 

The NIST study cited by the Department does not fault the 
performance of trusses; increasing the uplift requirements would not improve 
the quality of assembly. The problems associated with manufactured housing 
are related more to fasteners and tiedowns (13

(2)

). 


Response: 

The field studies referenced in the NIST Report identified 
numerous roof system failures that were generally due to failure of the end 
connections between the trusses and the sidewalls. However, even if the 
trusses had been properly connected to the manufactured home structure, the 
Department believes that trusses not designed to resist the uplift pressures 
referenced in this rule still may have failed. Therefore, in this final rule 
the Department has retained the proposed increased design requirements for 
roof trusses.

Other Specific Comments 




Comment: 

The Department is encouraged to coordinate this rule with a 
review of seismic and flood loads, especially with respect to foundation and 
attachment designs (25). 


Response: 

The requirements in the proposed rule for a permanent 
foundation design have been eliminated in this final rule. However, as the 
Department continues to review the issue of adequate anchoring/foundation 
systems for manufactured homes, it will also review these other 
considerations. 


Comment: 

There are not enough DAPIA personnel in the HUD system to 
review and approve design changes within the time provided for the 
effectiveness of this rule (83, 124, 136, 179). 


Response: 

The Department has agreed to delay the effectiveness of the 
new requirements for 180 days, which should allow sufficient time for the 
DAPIA process, as well. 


Comment: 

The Department should consider requiring the DAPIA approval 
stamp on all pages of a manufacturer's installation instructions (48). 


Response: 

The final rule continues to require that the manufacturer 
provide installation instructions certified by a registered professional 
engineer indicating at least one acceptable system of anchoring (24 CFR 
3280.306(b)). However, the Department will consider the suggestion to require 
a DAPIA approval stamp on each page of the manufacturers' installation 
instructions when developing future revisions to the Manufactured Home 
Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282). 


Comment: 

Some explanation is needed about the effect of the new 
standards on ``B'' letters, interpretative bulletins, and compliance 
determinations (122). 


Response: 

This new standard supersedes any portions of ``B'' letters, 
interpretative bulletins, and compliance determinations that are in conflict 
with this standard. 


Comment: 

If the higher standards are adopted, manufacturers will prefer 
to build modular homes that meet the necessary State standards. 


Response: 

Manufacturers are free to channel their activities in any way 
that best responds to market forces. In the development of the regulatory 
impact analysis, the Department has accounted for the cost of potential lost 
business. To the extent that manufacturers could redirect their production to 
alternative housing, the costs of the higher standards would be lessened. 
However, as noted above, the Department believes that the trend in State 
standards also will be to stricter wind standards. Therefore, while 
manufactured homes may experience a price increase because of these standards, 
they will be affordable relative to site-built homes meeting the higher State-imposed standards. 


Comment: 

The Department should prepare a brochure on hurricane 
awareness and windstorm protection. 


Response: 

As noted in the discussion on Improved Anchoring and 
Foundation Systems earlier in the preamble, the Department is reviewing what 
would be an appropriate consumer information disclosure requirement on 
installation. As part of that review, the Department may consider 
requirements on the disclosure of general information relating to high winds 
and hurricanes, and may coordinate with FEMA on the development of a brochure 
on hurricane awareness and protection for occupants of manufactured homes. 






(

Note:

 Other specific comments that have become moot as a result of the 
decision not to proceed with changes in Wind Zone I and requirements relating 
to a permanent foundation system are not addressed in this preamble.) 


III. Description of Changes to the Standards 


Because of the risk of loss of life to building occupants and the 
extraordinary loss of property due to Hurricane Andrew, the Department has 
determined that it is necessary to amend the Federal Manufactured Home 
Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to raise the level of wind 
resistance standards, especially in areas subject to high winds. 
Specifically, the Department is amending the FMHCSS to include a Basic Wind 
Zone Map that is based on the map contained in the incorporated standard 
ASCE 7-88, ``Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.'' 
The revised map contains a more concentrated area for the 100 mph wind 
zone than was specified in the current standard or the proposed rule. The 
boundary between Wind Zones I and II follows the 90 mph isotach on the 
ASCE 7-88 basic wind speed map, while the boundary between Wind Zones II and 
III remains the 100 mph isotach indicated in the proposed rule. The design 
wind speeds for high wind areas are designated as 100 mph for Wind Zone II and 
110 mph for Wind Zone III. This rule does not change the current design wind 
speed for Wind Zone I. 
Based on the revised map, this final rule enumerates the States, 
Territories, and local governments in which the more stringent standards will 
be applicable. The enumerated areas are those that the Department has 
determined to be at least partially within the higher wind zones demarcated on 
the revised map. The Department also will monitor local building code 
requirements and will consider adoption through rulemaking of requirements for 
manufactured homes that are comparable to any more stringent requirements 
established for site-built homes by a State or local building authority. 
The current wind standard for manufactured housing is considered 
inadequate because it addresses only positive (external) design wind pressures 
for walls, components, windows, and cladding, without specifying that designs 
must take into account the effect of negative pressure (suction) on these 
building elements, as well as internal pressures on walls and roof/ceiling 
systems. The formulae used in ASCE 7-88 also include other factors, which 
account for higher uplift forces on roof eaves, ridges, overhangs, and 
corners. These and other issues are now addressed in high wind areas by 
requiring the manufactured home structure, components, and cladding to be 
designed to resist design wind forces for Exposure C, as specified in 
ASCE 7-88.

<PARENT> FR940114-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Requirements for structural assemblies, components, connectors, 
fasteners, and a number of other areas will be strengthened so that parts and 
portions of the home will be able to resist the same wind forces as required 
for site-built and modular housing. In addition, the increased wind loads 
required by this rule are applicable whether structural systems, components, 
or other aspects of the design are substantiated by engineering analysis or by 
suitable load tests (see subpart E of part 3280). The revised standards also 
require that the ground anchoring and foundation support systems continue to 
be designed by a registered engineer or architect in a manner adequate to 
withstand the higher wind forces specified. 


III. Section-by-Section Analysis 


The Secretary has determined that the following changes should be made 
to the standards: 
(1) 

Section 3280.4

_The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is 
added to the list of organizations issuing standards that are incorporated by 
reference. The street addresses are corrected for two other organizations 
listed. 
(2) 

Section 3280.5

_Technical and conforming corrections are made to 
standardize paragraph designations to 

Federal Register

 format and clarify the 
information to be included on data plates. The new requirements also 
incorporate changes to the data plate adopted in the Energy Rule (58 FR 54975, 
55003) for effect in October 1994, in order to avoid having inconsistent 
requirements become effective within a short time. 
The data plate is also being expanded to indicate that manufactured 
homes should not be located within 1500
' of the coastline in Wind Zones II and 
III unless the home and its anchoring or foundation system are designed for 
the increased requirements of Exposure D in ASCE 7-88. The data plate will 
now also indicate whether the home has been equipped with storm shutters and, 
if shutters are not provided, will strongly recommend that the home be made 
ready for these devices in accordance with the method described in the 
installation instructions. 
(3) 

Sections 3280.302(a)(8), 3280.303(d), 3280.305(c)

_The definition 
and references to ``hurricane resistive design'' in these sections are deleted, 
in favor of the Wind Zone II and III designations in the revised Basic Wind 
Zone Map. These changes will result in the identification of design wind 
forces and wind speeds for which the home has been designed, rather than the 
designation of homes as ``hurricane resistive.'' 
(4) 

Section 3280.304

_The incorporated standards are amended to 
require that the minimum design loads be based on ASCE 7-88, which replaces 
the obsolete ANSI A58.1-1982 standard currently referenced in this section. 
In addition, the National Design Specification for Wood Members (NDS), 
incorporated by reference, is updated to the most current specification issued 
by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). Because manufacturers 
will need to redesign the structure's resistance to wind forces, the redesign 
should be accomplished with the most current design values for wood. 
Accordingly, the 1991 NDS is incorporated in its entirety into the standards. 
(5) 

Section 3280.305(c)

_The standards are amended to require that for 
manufactured homes in high wind areas, the home and each wind resisting part, 
including components and cladding, be completely designed to resist the design 
wind pressures specified for a 50-year recurrence level by ASCE 7-88 or the 
pressures specified in a table of equivalent design wind load provisions. The 
Department has designated three wind zones: Zone I (current wind design 
requirements for Zone I); Zone II (design wind speed of 100 mph); and Zone III 
(design wind speed of 110 mph). 
The Table of Design Pressures in the proposed rule is clarified and 
expanded. Editorial revisions to clarify the application of the uplift 
pressure requirements for exterior roof coverings, eaves and gables. In 
addition, footnotes are included to indicate: 
 Distributional pressure effects between windward and leeward walls; 
 The application of the Table is limited to roof slopes between 10 and 
30 degrees and that horizontal drag pressures need not be considered for roof 
slopes under 20 degrees; 
 The design uplift pressures are the same regardless of whether they 
are applied normal to the roof surface or to the horizontal projection of the 
roof; and 
 Exterior roof and wall coverings (excluding glazing), sheathing, and 
fastenings need not be evaluated for the design pressures specified by the 
Table, when fastened to a 3/8
'
' structural rated sheathing and the sheathing is 
oriented and secured to framing members in accordance with the fastening 
schedule specified in the Table. 
The Basic Wind Zone Map is revised by delineating the boundary between 
Wind Zones I and II as the 90 mph isotach, and the boundary between Wind Zones 
II and III as the 100 mph isotach, on the ASCE 7-88 basic wind speed map. 
This change will result in certain areas of existing Wind Zone II being 
located in the modified Wind Zone I. The boundary between Wind Zones I and 
III in Alaska is now designated as the 90 mph isotach on the ASCE 7-88 map.

(6) 

Section 3280.305(d)

_Interpretative Bulletin D-5-76, under which the Department has been operating since the late 1970s,
is paraphrased as a new paragraph (2). It clarifies that the deflection limit for a cantilevered roof is 2 times the
length divided by 180. Eaves and cornices shall be designed for a net uplift pressure of 2.5 times the design uplift
wind pressure cited in  3280.305(c)(1)(i) for Wind Zone I, and for the design pressures cited in  3280.305(c)(1)(ii)
for Wind Zones II and III. This change has already been issued in the Energy Rule (58 FR 54975, 55006), but is modified
in this rule to reflect the standards established for the new Wind Zones.

(7) 

Section 3280.305(e)

_The standards for fastening of roof framing to wall framing and wall to floor framing are changed to require the use
of 26 gage minimum steel strapping, or those elements shall be connected by a combination of strapping and structural
rated wall sheathing that overlaps the roof and floor. Investigations after Hurricane Andrew revealed that current
designs allowed 30 gage straps with staples for connections of roofs to walls, and walls to floors; such straps were
inadequate to resist even moderate wind forces.

(7) 

Section 3280.306(a)

_The wind design loads used for calculating resistance of support and anchoring systems to overturning and lateral
movements are revised to include the simultaneous application of the horizontal drag and uplift forces determined
in  3280.305(c).

(8) 

Section 3280.306(g)(2)

_The standards are amended to require that the manufacturer's instructions for anchoring equipment be certified
in accordance with the testing procedures found in ASTM D3953-91, Standard Specification for Strapping, Flat
Steel and Seals. The certification must be made by a registered engineer, architect, or independent third party testing
agency. This is an updated standard for steel strapping that supersedes the standard originally referenced in the
Federal standard.

(9) 

Sections 3280.403 and 3280.404

_These sections are amended to require all primary windows, including egress windows and sliding glass doors, to
resist the design exterior and interior wind pressures specified in  3280.305(c)(1) for components and cladding.
These requirements are effective one year from today's date of publication of this rule, as provided in the ``DATES''
section of this preamble. In addition, manufacturers are required to provide instructions for the installation
of shutters or protective covers, to protect the windows and doors.

(10) 

Section 3282.362

_Minor conforming changes regarding the data plate are made in paragraph (c)(3)(i). These changes are explained
under  3280.5.



V. Other Matters



Significant Regulatory Action



The Director of the Office of Management and Budget has indicated that this rule could constitute a ``significant
regulatory action'' as that term is defined in section 3(f) of the Executive Order on Regulatory Planning and Review
issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Because an estimation of the new requirements as proposed indicated
that they might have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, a regulatory impact analysis has been prepared
for this final rule. This analysis concludes that the requirements that will be imposed by this final rule will have
an effect on the economy of less than $100 million, and will have benefits that outweigh the costs of the additional
requirements. This analysis is available for public inspection during regular business hours in room 10276, Rules
Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20410.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. However, the regulatory impact analysis referenced in the preceding paragraph also provides
relevant analysis and discussion of possible economic impact on businesses, including small businesses, that must
comply with the provisions of this rule. The rule will establish additional safety standards for manufactured housing,
and therefore would affect the design and construction requirements in specified areas of the country. The nature
of the rule and its purpose do not present an opportunity for the Department to vary the rule's requirements so as to
reduce burdens on small entities.



Environmental Impact



At the time of publication of the proposed rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment
was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without any change that would be
significant for purposes of additional environmental impact. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant
impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the
office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.



Executive Order 12612, Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule have federalism implications, and are subject to review under the Order.
Specifically, the rule provides for mandatory specifications for the construction of manufactured homes that exceed
the standards currently permitted in certain areas of the country. States and local governments would no longer have
the option of imposing separate requirements that exceed current standards, but are less stringent than these new
standards. However, because the Federal standards already preempt local discretion in the construction of manufactured
homes, this marginal degree of preemption is not believed to be significant for purposes of identifying federalism
concerns.

Therefore, for these reasons and because of the health and safety aspects of this rule, the General Counsel has determined
that the federalism implications are not sufficient to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment under
the Order.



Executive Order 12606, the Family



In the proposed rule, the Department indicated that the rule was not subject to review under Executive Order 12606,
The Family. As addressed earlier in this preamble, some of the commenters were concerned about this position. Although
the Department does not believe this final rule implicates family concerns within the spirit of the Executive Order,
the Department has analyzed the rule as required under the Order.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under the Executive Order, has evaluated the potential of this rule
to have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Although as a result of the
more stringent construction requirements implemented by this rule, some families may lose an ownership option for
housing, the general well-being of families, and society, is served better by ensuring minimal quality standards
for such housing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has certified that, to the extent permitted by law,
the rule has undergone a Family Impact Assessment under the Executive Order.

(d) 

Design load deflection. 

(1) When a structural assembly is subjected to total design live loads, the deflection for structural framing members
shall not exceed the following (where L equals the clear span between supports or two times the length of a cantilever):

 

Floor_L/240 
Roof and ceiling_L/180 
Headers, beams, and girders (vertical load)_L/180 
Walls and partitions_L/180 


(2) The allowable eave or cornice deflection for uplift is to be measured at the design uplift load of 9 psf for Wind Zone
I, and at the design uplift pressure cited in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for Wind Zones II and III. The allowable
deflection shall be (2 x Lc)/180, where Lc is the measured horizontal eave projection from the wall. 
(e) 

Fastening of structural systems. 

(1) Roof framing shall be securely fastened to wall framing, walls to floor structure, and floor structure to chassis
to secure and maintain continuity between the floor and chassis, so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding
as specified in this part. 
(2) For Wind Zones II and III, roof trusses shall be secured to exterior wall framing members (studs), and exterior
wall framing members (studs) shall be secured to floor framing members, with 26 gage minimum steel strapping or brackets
or by a combination of 26 gage minimum steel strapping or brackets and structural rated wall sheathing that overlaps
the roof and floor. Steel strapping or brackets shall be installed at a maximum spacing of 24
'
' on center in Wind Zone II and at a maximum of 16
'
' on center in Wind Zone III. The number and type of fasteners used to secure the steel straps or brackets or structural
sheathing shall be capable of transferring all uplift forces between elements being joined.
