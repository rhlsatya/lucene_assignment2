Excessive Manufacturing (Make) Allowance in State Marketing Orders for Milk 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Supplemental proposed rule; extension of comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document announces a 60-day extension of the time for submitting comments on the supplemental proposed rule,
published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58299), and additional comments on the original proposed rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27371), for implementing section 102 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act
of 1990, as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 102 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 provides that no State shall provide for
(and no person shall collect, directly or indirectly) a greater allowance for the processing of milk (``make allowance'')
than is permitted under a Federal program to establish a Grade A price for manufacturing butter, nonfat dry milk, or
cheese. 


On November 1, 1993, a supplemental proposed rule was published to implement section 102. A supplemental proposed
rule was deemed necessary because of (1) comments received on the original proposed rule published on June 19, 1992,
and (2) regulations issued by the Agricultural Marketing Service concerning the pricing of milk used to produce nonfat
dry milk after the publication of the original proposed rule for section 102. The supplemental proposed rule specified
that all comments had to be received by January 31, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration. 
Requests have been received from interested parties who indicate that they need additional time to prepare an analysis
of the supplemental proposed rule. Based upon our review of those requests, it has been determined that an additional
60 days will be allowed for comment. Accordingly, comments on the proposed rule must now be received by April 1, 1994,
in order to be assured of consideration. 


Notice 


Notice is hereby given that the period of time for submitting comments on the supplemental proposed rule published
on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58299), and for submitting additional comments on the original proposed rule, published
in the 

Federal Register

 on June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27371), is extended to April 1, 1994. 



Signed this 10th day of January 1994 in Washington, DC.

Revisions to the Direct Operating (OL), Farm Ownership (FO), Soil and Water (SW) and Emergency (EM) Loan Regulations
to Modify Collateral Requirements 



Agency: 

Farmers Home Administration, USDA. 




Action: 

Proposed rule. 





Summary: 

The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its direct operating (OL), farm ownership (FO), soil and
water (SW) and emergency (EM) loan making and servicing regulations to modify collateral requirements. These amendments
concern the amount of collateral required when an FmHA loan is made. There will be no change in security requirements
for loan restructuring. The intended effect is to reduce the burden on farmers and FmHA personnel in servicing FmHA
loan collateral and to avoid encumbering all of a farmer's collateral, thereby making it less difficult for farmers
who receive FmHA loans to subsequently obtain non-FmHA credit. 




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Classification 



We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a
``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this
proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a
material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866. 



Intergovernmental Consultation 



1. For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983)
and FmHA Instruction 1940-J, ``Intergovernmental Review of Farmers Home Administration Programs and Activities''
(December 23, 1983), Farm Ownership Loans, Farm Operating Loans, and Emergency Loans are excluded from the scope
of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. 

2. The Soil and Water Loan Program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 and FmHA Instruction 1940-J.




Programs Affected 



These changes affect the following FmHA programs as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 




10.404_Emergency Loans 

10.406_Farm Operating Loans 

10.407_Farm Ownership Loans 

10.416_Soil and Water Loans

Environmental Impact Statement 



This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the
determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 



Civil Justice Reform 



This document has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of FmHA that
this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in section
2 of the E.O. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 0575-0141,
0575-0085, 0575-0083, 0575-0090 and 0575-0133 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The proposed rule does not revise or impose any new information collection or recordkeeping
requirement from those approved by OMB. 



Discussion of Proposed Rule 



It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
shall be published for comment not withstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. FmHA is publishing
this proposed rule with a 15-day comment period. This proposed rule relieves the restriction of taking a lien on all
assets at the time of loan making. Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that the need to provide immediate assistance
to farmers who have suffered severe production and physical losses as a result of natural disasters also justifies
the shortened comment period under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) as discussed below. 

Major agricultural disasters during the 1993 crop year, including extensive flooding and rainfall in 9 Midwestern
States and drought in 3 Southeastern States will result in a significant increase in demand for FmHA direct loan assistance.
Requests will not be limited to emergency loan applications. In the 9 flood states alone, over 8 million acres of crops
were lost or not planted in 1993. Estimates indicate that the 1993 floods were the second costliest weather disaster
in the history of the United States. Preliminary estimates are that as many as 10,000 of the affected farmers may require
financial assistance from FmHA. 

Frequently, other lenders are willing to provide part of the farmers' credit needs, in combination with some FmHA
assistance. However, 
the existing FmHA loan security requirements would preclude many lenders from continuing to provide credit to these
farmers. FmHA does not have the staff or financial resources to cope with this situation without participation from
private sector lenders. The need for a change in the regulations is immediate. Most farmers are now concluding 1993
operations, consulting with their lenders, and planning for 1994. FmHA is receiving loan requests at an increasing
rate. The Agency wants to give the public an opportunity for input on the proposed change but FmHA needs regulations
in place for spring planting, so a reasonable compromise was the 15-day comment period. Because of the scope of the
situation and the impact on local, regional, and national economies, the Agency believes that an amendment to the
regulations after a shortened comment period is the only way to assure that affected farmers receive the assistance
they need on a timely basis to recover from these disasters. Any further delay in the timing of this amendment will reduce
the Agency's ability to meet the needs of those affected, thus imposing additional hardships on those who have already
suffered substantially from flood or drought, and jeopardizing individual and community financial recovery from
these disasters. 

In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) submitted a report (GAO/RCED-89-9) to the Senate Committee
on Agriculture addressing FmHA's loan making policies and practices. One of the concerns noted was FmHA's eroding
security position on many loans and the significant dollar losses being projected (and realized). One of GAO's recommendations
addressed the need for a change in FmHA collateral requirements. The report recommended additional security be taken
when servicing loans, including obtaining the best security interest available on all of the borrower's assets.
In an effort to reduce loan losses and protect the public interest, FmHA published a proposed rule on February 15, 1991,
requiring a lien on all assets when loans are made. A final rule implementing this policy was published on April 30,
1992. On April 30, 1992, the Agency also published an interim rule requiring a lien on all a borrower's assets when loans
are restructured. This policy had been issued as a proposed rule on October 23, 1991. 

The requirement for a lien on all assets at the time a loan is made was intended to assure that FmHA had a security interest
in all of a borrower's property, reducing the potential for program abuse and loan losses. However, this policy has
proven unwieldy, imposing an excessive burden on FmHA borrowers and requiring an excessive amount of FmHA staff time.
When FmHA acquires a security interest in property owned by a borrower, that security must be serviced in accordance
with all FmHA regulations applying to the type of security property involved, regardless of the purpose of the loan.
For example, under existing regulations, the recipient of an FmHA FO loan must pledge not only real estate, but all
chattel property as well to secure the loan. The borrower must account to FmHA for all farm products sold, even though
FmHA's primary interest in the sale is for payment of the FO loan installment coming due, not the disposition of loan
security. This requirement imposes a major burden on borrowers, especially on those who sell farm products on a frequent
basis. Also, FmHA employees must spend a significant amount of time completing the necessary documentation for release
of its security interest for such sales. This time is a precious resource that the Agency believes would be better spent
providing advice and counsel to those borrowers under the most severe hardship who could benefit most from FmHA credit
supervision.

One of the exceptions to FmHA's blanket lien requirement is that a lien will not be taken on chattel security when it
will prevent the applicant from obtaining operating credit from other sources. This exception does not adequately
correct the problems experienced with the lien on all assets rule. FmHA officials sometimes determine this exception
is not necessary at the time the loan is made. However, taking a lien can later interfere with a borrower's ability to
obtain credit from other sources, when borrowers have sufficient equity in assets to qualify for a non-FmHA loan to
meet a portion of their credit needs. The Agency can subordinate or release liens on security property to facilitate
credit from other lenders. However, these actions also impose a processing burden on borrowers and require staff
time. Further, the Agency has found that some lenders shy away from providing credit to such borrowers due to the time
and paperwork involved, even though the borrower otherwise meets the lender's loan criteria. The only recourse for
the borrower to meet his or her credit needs is to request FmHA assistance. Thus, the lien on all assets requirement
forces those borrowers who would otherwise not have a need for FmHA credit to consume resources which would be more
appropriately directed toward borrowers in greater difficulty. Devoting more attention to those borrowers who
desperately need intensive financial assistance and the time of FmHA staff should reduce the failure rate of these
borrowers, thereby reducing program costs. 

The intent of this proposed rule is to make the loan security requirements less demanding while continuing to protect
the Government's interest. The Agency will continue to make loans provided the value of the security available is
at least equal to the amount of the loan. This is consistent with the authorizing statute and the Agency's mission of
providing assistance to farmers with limited financial resources. However, rather than requiring a lien on all a
borrower's additional assets, if any, when making a loan, FmHA generally will only require a lien on property only
to the point that the value of the security is at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. The Agency has determined
that security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount will provide adequate assurance of repayment. Studies
have indicated that loan liquidation costs are about 20 percent of the value of collateral. Additionally, the Agency
has a funding cost as a result of monies borrowed from the Treasury in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act
of 1990, which continues until the loan is paid or written off. This cost is difficult to estimate because interest
rates and liquidation periods vary widely. However, this cost should be no more than 30 percent of the loan amount on
the average. 

Obtaining security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount is a goal. Generally, the Agency will be unable to
obtain security exactly meeting the 150 percent goal. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan will only be taken
when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land, same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood
sows), and when nonessential assets are taken as security for EM loans, as discussed below. 

The first security preference for operating type loans will be crops/chattels, and for real estate type loans the
first priority will be real estate. Where there are several collateral possibilities for chattels (cattle, machinery)
or real estate (different tracts of land), the FmHA loan approval official will select the most reasonable choice
to reach the 150 percent collateral goal. If the applicant offers an acceptable alternative, the loan approval official
will accept the applicant's choice. Because of this change, entity members no longer need to pledge their assets as
collateral. Entity members still will be personally obligated on the loan note(s). The Agency proposes to amend 7
CFR part 1941, subpart A,  1941.19; part 1943, subpart A,  1943.19; part 1943, subpart B,  1943.69;
and part 1945, subpart D,  1945.169 to incorporate these changes. All loan making regulations are being changed
because most applicants affected by disasters apply for various types of farm loans and the changes are needed for
administrative consistency. 

The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A,  1943.19 to state that chattel property will be taken
as security for real estate loans only in certain situations. For the reasons discussed earlier with regard to burdensome
chattel security servicing requirements and reduced availability of conventional credit, farm ownership (FO)
loans will not be secured with chattels unless there is no other real estate available to provide security at least
equal to the loan amount, or unless the chattels are real estate improvements (fixtures) made with FO funds. Generally,
real estate values are more constant than chattel values and provide adequate loan security. Chattel security is
not desirable on long term real estate loans due to servicing difficulties and rapid depreciation. Because of the
limited circumstances in which certain chattel security will be taken on real estate loans, the exception for when
title to a livestock or crop enterprise is held by a contractor or under a share lease agreement is no longer needed.
The exception to taking a lien, therefore, is being removed from subparts A and B and part 1943. To clarify the existing
policy and to assure that all possibilities are considered when the available loan security is not at least equal to
the loan amount, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A,  1943.19, along with 7 CFR part 1941, subpart A,  1941.19; 7
CFR part 1943, subpart B,  1943.69; and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D,  1945.169, are revised to specifically
state that in situations where the farmer does not or will not have adequate real estate or chattel property to secure
the loan needed, other property, including real estate owned by a third party, can serve as security. A pledge of security
is preferable to a cosigner. 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A,  1943.19, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart B,  1943.69,
and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D,  1945.169 will be revised accordingly. This policy already is stated in existing
7 CFR part 1941, subpart A,  1941.19.

The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D,  1945.169 to add a provision regarding nonessential
assets in EM loan situations. In many cases, EM loan applicants are not typical FmHA loan applicants in that they may
have significant nonfarm asset holdings. Prior to April 30, 1992, FmHA had required EM loan applicants to liquidate
nonessential assets prior to loan closing if possible, on the theory that the applicant's equity in these assets should
be used to reduce Government subsidized credit needs. This policy proved to impose hardship on farmers already suffering
from the affects of a disaster, with minimal results. In many cases, the assets in question could not be sold for the
estimated value, and thus no equity was realized. In other cases, the assets were not readily liquidated, and loan
recipients were forced to accept much less than true value, or unable to liquidate the assets at any price within the
necessary timeframe. As a result of these difficulties, FmHA modified this policy and amended the regulations to
require a lien on, rather than a sale of, such assets. A lien on all nonessential assets (with no 150% limit) assures
the Agency that the equity will be applied to reducing the farmer's Federally subsidized credit when nonessential
assets are sold. On this basis, the requirement for a lien on all nonessential assets in the case of EM loans is continued
even though the requirement for a lien on all farm assets is substantially modified. 

Finally, the Agency has amended 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S,  1951.910. The requirement that liens will be taken
on all assets when loans are restructured will be continued to protect against potential loan losses as a result of
extended repayment terms. The Agency proposes to continue this action since a significant amount of debt has been
written off over the years, the Agency continues to have a large number of financially stressed high-risk borrowers,
and to comply with the GAO report discussed previously in this rule. This section had previously referred to the loan
making regulations to prescribe the security requirements for loan restructuring. Since the requirements for loan
making will now be different from loan servicing, it is necessary to insert the guidelines into the debt restructuring
regulations.

PART 1941_OPERATING LOANS 


1. The authority citation for part 1941 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1989; 5 U.S.C. 301; 7 CFR 2.23 and 2.70. 


Subpart A_Operating Loan Policies, Procedures, and Authorizations 


2. Section 1941.19 is amended by redesignating current paragraphs (b) through (i) as paragraphs (c) through (j),
respectively, revising paragraph (a), and adding a new introductory paragraph and a new paragraph (b) to read as follows:



 1941.19 

Security. 


Primary security must be available for the loan. If available, the total amount of security required will be at least
equal to 150 percent of the loan amount. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it
is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood sows). In unusual cases,
the loan approval official may require a cosigner as defined in  1910.3 (d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter
or a pledge of security from a third party. A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner. 
(a) 

Chattels.

 The loan must be secured by: 
(1) A first lien on all property or products acquired, produced, or refinanced with loan funds. 
(2) If the security for the loan under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not at least equal to 150 percent of the loan
amount, the best lien obtainable will be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point that
security for the loan at least equals 150 percent of the loan amount. 
(i) When there are several alternatives available (cattle, machinery), any one of which will meet the security requirements
of this section, the approval official will select the most logical and efficient alternative for obtaining security.

(ii) When alternatives exist and the applicant has a preference as to the property to be taken for security, the approval
official will honor the preference so long as the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section are met.

(b) 

Real estate

. The loan approval official will require a lien on all or part of the applicant's real estate as security when chattel
security alone is not at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. Different lien positions on real estate
are considered separate and identifiable collateral. 
(1) Security may also include assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, revenues,
royalties from mineral rights, patents and copyrights, and pledges of security by third parties. 
(2) Advice on obtaining security will be received from OGC when necessary.

PART 1943_FARM OWNERSHIP, SOIL AND WATER AND RECREATION 


3. The authority citation for part 1943 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1989; 5 U.S.C. 301; 7 CFR 2.23 and 2.70. 


Subpart A_Direct Farm Ownership Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations 


4. Section 1943.19 is amended by removing paragraphs (a)(2), and (b)(4); redesignating current paragraphs (a)(3)
through (a)(8) as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(7), respectively, and paragraph (b)(5) as (b)(4); redesignating
current paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f), as paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g), respectively; revising the introductory
paragraph, paragraph (a)(1), newly redesignated paragraph (a)(2), paragraph (c), and adding new paragraph (b)
to read as follows: 


 1943.19 

Security. 


Each FO loan will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security also may be taken as security. The total
amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount, or all real estate owned by the applicant.
A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security for the loan is at least equal to the loan
amount. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate
the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official may require a cosigner as defined
in  1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter or a pledge of security from a third party. A pledge of security
is preferable to a cosigner. 
(a) * * * (1) A mortgage will be taken on all real estate acquired, refinanced or improved with FO funds,
and by any additional real estate security needed to meet the requirements of this section. 
(2) Security will also include items which are considered part of the farm and ordinarily pass with the title to the
farm, such as but not limited to assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, water rights,
easements, rights-of-way, revenues, and royalties from mineral rights.

(b) 

Chattel security

. Ordinarily, FO loans will not be secured by chattels. However, loans will be secured by chattels as follows: 
(1) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures purchased or refinanced with loan funds whenever such property
cannot be included in the real estate lien and the additional security is needed to secure the loan. 
(2) Chattel security will be obtained when there is not enough real estate security for the loan and the best lien obtainable
on all real estate has been taken. 
(3) The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Therefore,
junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity in the property. However, when possible, a first lien
on selected chattel items should be obtained. 
(4) Chattel security liens will be obtained and kept effective, as provided in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter.

(c) 

Other security

. (1) A pledge of real estate by a third party may be taken as security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. 
(2) Other property may be taken as additional security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender value of
life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.

5. Section 1943.69 is amended by removing paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(4), and (c)(1); redesignating current paragraphs
(a)(3) through (a)(8) as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(7) respectively; redesignating current paragraph (b)(5)
as paragraph (b)(4); redesignating current paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) as paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4)
respectively; revising the introductory paragraph, paragraph (a)(1), newly redesignated paragraph (a)(2), paragraph
(c) introductory text, and newly redesignated paragraph (c)(1) to read as follows: 


 1943.69 

Security. 


Each SW loan will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security also may be taken as security. The total
amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount, or all real estate owned by the applicant.
A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security for the loan is at least equal to the loan
amount. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate
the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official may require a cosigner as defined
in  1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter or a pledge of security from a third party. A pledge of security
is preferable to a cosigner. 
(a) * * * (1) A mortgage will be taken on all real estate refinanced or improved with SW funds, and by any
additional real estate security needed to meet the requirements of this section. 
(2) Security will also include items which are considered part of the farm and ordinarily pass with the title to the
farm, such as, but not limited to assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, water rights,
easements, rights-of-way, revenues, and royalties from mineral rights. 


* * * * * 


(c) 

Chattel security

. Loans will be secured by chattels when there is not adequate real estate security for the loan. 
(1) The loan will be secured by: 
(i) A first lien on all property acquired, improved, or refinanced with loan funds; and 
(ii) If the security for the loan is not at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount, the best lien obtainable will
be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point that security for the loan equals 150 percent
of the loan amount.

Subpart D_Emergency Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations 


7. Section 1945.169 is amended by redesignating current paragraphs (b) through (n) as paragraphs (d) through (p),
respectively; revising paragraph (a), and adding a new introductory paragraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) to read
as follows: 


 1945.169 

Security. 


Each EM loan will be secured by chattels, real estate, and/or other security and nonessential assets in accordance
with this section. The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same
borrower. Thus, a junior lien on property serving as collateral for a guaranteed loan(s) is acceptable.

(a) 

Security for operating type purposes. 

In the case of emergency loans made for subtitle B (operating) purposes, primary security must be available for the
loan, except as provided for in  1945.169 (e)(2) of this section. If available, the total amount of security
required will be at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,
security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the property,
i.e., same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood sows). In unusual cases, the loan approval official may require a cosigner
as defined in  1910.3 (d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter, or a pledge of security from a third party. A
pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner. 

(1) 

Chattels. 

The loan must be secured by: 

(i) A first lien on all property or products acquired, produced, or refinanced with loan funds. 

(ii) If the security for the loan under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is not at least equal to 150 percent of the
loan amount, the best lien obtainable will be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point
that security for the loan at least equals 150 percent of the loan amount. 

(A) When there are several alternatives available (cattle, machinery), any one of which will meet the security requirements
of this section, the approval official will select the most logical and efficient alternative for obtaining security.


(B) When alternatives exist and the applicant has a preference as to the property to be taken for security, the approval
official will honor the preference so long as the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are
met. 

(2) 

Real estate. 

The loan approval official will require a lien on all or part of the applicant's real estate as security when chattel
security alone is not at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. Different lien positions on real estate
are considered separate and identifiable collateral. 

(3) 

Other security. 

(i) A pledge of real estate or chattels by a third party may be taken as security when the property owned by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. 

(ii) Other property that cannot be converted to cash without jeopardizing the applicant's farm operation or imposing
substantial financial penalty on the applicant may be taken as additional security when the property owned by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender
value of life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.


(b) Security for real estate type purposes. 

EM loans made for subtitle A (real estate) purposes will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security
also may be taken as security. The total amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount,
or all real estate owned by the applicant. A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security
for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount, except as provided for in  1945.169(e)(2) of this section. Except
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken
when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official
may require a cosigner as defined in  1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter, or a pledge of security
from someone other than the applicant(s). A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner. 

(1) 

Real estate security. 

(i) A mortgage will be taken on all real estate repaired or rehabilitated, refinanced, or improved with EM funds, and
by any additional real estate security needed to meet the requirements of this section. 

(ii) Security will also include assignments of leases or leasehold interests which have mortgageable value, water
rights, easements, rights of way, mineral rights, and royalties. 

(iii) A first lien is required on real estate, when available. Loans may be secured by a junior lien on real estate provided:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(A) Prior lien instruments do not contain provisions for future advances (except for taxes, insurance, and other
costs needed to protect the security, or reasonable foreclosure costs), cancellation, summary forfeiture, or other
clauses that may jeopardize the Government's interest or the applicant's ability to pay the loan unless any such undesirable
provision is waived, modified, or subordinated insofar as the Government is concerned. 

(B) Agreements are obtained from prior lienholders to give notice of foreclosure to FmHA whenever State law or other
arrangements do not require such a notice. Any agreements needed will be obtained as provided in subpart B of part 1927
of this chapter, except as modified by the ``Memorandum of Understanding-FCA-FmHA,'' FmHA Instruction 2000-R
(available in any FmHA office). 

(2) Chattel security. 

Loans will be secured by chattels as follows: 

(i) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures purchased or refinanced with loan funds whenever such property
cannot be included in the real estate lien and the additional security is needed to secure the loan. 

(ii) Chattel security will be obtained when there is not enough real estate security for the loan. 

(iii) The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Therefore,
junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity in the property. However, when possible, a first lien
on selected chattel items should be obtained. 

(iv) Chattel security liens will be obtained and kept effective, as provided in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter.


(3) 

Other security. 

(i) A pledge of real estate by a third party may be taken as security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. 

(ii) Other property may be taken as additional security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender value of
life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.


(c) Nonessential assets. 

Nonessential assets are assets which the applicant has an ownership interest in that do not contribute a net income
to pay family living expenses or to maintain a sound farming operation (see  1962.17 of subpart A of part 1962
of this chapter for further guidance). A lien will be taken on all nonessential assets if an applicant cannot or will
not dispose of the assets and use the proceeds to reduce the FmHA credit needs prior to loan closing. The 150 percent
security requirement does not apply to nonessential assets.

Lien on certain assets. 

Delinquent borrowers must pledge certain assets, essential and nonessential, unencumbered to FmHA as security
at the time FmHA loans are restructured, as follows: 

(1) The best lien obtainable will be taken on all assets owned by the borrower. When the borrower is an entity, the best
lien obtainable will be taken on all assets owned by the entity, and all assets owned by all members of the entity. Different
lien positions on real estate are considered separate and identifiable collateral. 

(2) Security will include, but is not limited to, the following: land, buildings, structures, fixtures, machinery,
equipment, livestock, livestock products, growing crops, stored crops, inventory, supplies, accounts receivable,
certain cash or special cash collateral accounts, marketable securities, certificates of ownership of precious
metals, and cash surrender value of life insurance. 

(3) Security will also include assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, revenues,
royalties from mineral rights, patents and copyrights, and pledges of security by third parties. 

(4) The exceptions set forth in  1941.19(c) of subpart A of part 1941 apply. 

(5) These assets will be considered as additional security for the loans as well as any shared appreciation agreement.
The value of the essential assets will not be included in the NRV calculation to determine restructure. The FmHA lien
will be taken only at the time of closing the restructured FmHA loans.

Brucellosis Surveillance; MCI Reactor Prevalence Rates 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations to eliminate the requirement that States maintain specified
Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We are
proposing instead to require the States to successfully close (epidemiologically investigate and resolve) certain
percentages of cases detected through the MCI program. We believe these amendments would better serve Federal and
State animal health officials in their efforts to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Brucellosis is an infectious disease of certain animals and humans. In its principal animal hosts, it is characterized
by abortion and impaired fertility. Through a cooperative Federal-State effort, the United States is now approaching
total eradication of the field strain 

Brucella abortus 

in domestic cattle and bison herds. As of May 1993, there were only 337 known infected cattle and bison herds, and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had declared 32 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands free of the
disease. Fewer than 500 new infected herds were identified last year. 
The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison,
and swine to prevent the spread of brucellosis. Section 78.1 defines the terms used in the regulations. In accordance
with  78.1, States and areas can be classified as Class Free, Class A, Class B, or Class C. These terms refer to
stages of the eradication process as determined by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
and State animal health officials. Class Free States and areas are considered to be free of 

Brucella abortus 

in all domestic livestock, and Class C States and areas have the highest levels of brucellosis infection. Section
78.1 sets forth the standards States or areas must meet to achieve and maintain each of the classifications. 
One standard for classification is the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rate. Under the MCI
program, slaughtering establishments must collect blood samples from 95 percent of all cows and bulls 2 years of age
and older (known as MCI test cattle). The samples are then subjected to an official brucellosis test. Animals that
have serologically positive results to the official brucellosis test administered under the MCI program are MCI
reactors. The regulations require animal health officials to trace MCI reactors to the farm of origin and conduct
an epidemiologic investigation, to evaluate the risk that brucellosis could spread from the farm of origin. Class
Free and Class A States and areas must trace at least 90 percent of all MCI reactors to the farm of origin, and Class B and
Class C States and areas must trace at least 80 percent to the farm of origin. When required by the results of the epidemiologic
investigation, herd blood tests must be conducted or the herds must be confined to the premises under quarantine.
Examples of when herd testing or quarantine may not be necessary include cases where epidemiologic investigation
reveals the MCI reactor results were not caused by field strains of 

Brucella

, or that the herd has been or will be sent to slaughter. 
The MCI reactor prevalence rate is the rate of infection in a State or area's cattle population based on the percentage
of MCI reactors found in the total number of MCI tested cattle. Under the regulations, Class Free States and areas must
maintain a 12-consecutive-month MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed 0.050 percent. For Class A States and areas,
the rate must not exceed 0.10 percent, and for Class B States and areas, the rate must not exceed 0.30 percent. Class
C States and areas have an MCI reactor prevalence rate that exceeds 0.30 percent. Class Free, Class A, and Class B States
and areas that exceed the required percentages may be reclassified to a lower classification. 
Tests used to identify MCI reactors detect not only serum titers caused by brucellosis infection but also serum titers
caused by certain other organisms and by vaccination. As a result of such spurious titers, an estimate of brucellosis
prevalence based solely on the MCI reactor prevalence rate in a State or area would overestimate the rate of brucellosis
infection. Nevertheless, the MCI reactor data has been helpful to Federal and State animal health officials who use
the rates of the individual States and areas to reveal trends and to compare their progress in eradicating brucellosis.

When the United States had thousands of infected herds, we did not consider the effect of spurious titers on the States'
and areas' MCI reactor prevalence rates to be significant. However, as the level of brucellosis infection in this
country has declined, the proportion of spurious titers in the MCI reactor prevalence rates has increased. As a result,
in Class Free States and areas, the MCI reactor prevalence rate may consist entirely of spurious titers. Therefore,
we no longer believe a State or area's MCI reactor prevalence rate is a good indication of its eradication progress,
and we are proposing to eliminate the requirement in the regulations that States and areas meet specific MCI reactor
prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications.

If States no longer need to meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates, we believe it is even more important for the
States to concentrate on the activities required following identification of an MCI reactor (tracebacks, epidemiologic
investigations, and, usually, herd testing or quarantine). The epidemiologic investigation and herd testing can
reveal whether an MCI reaction is a spurious titer or a valid indication of brucellosis. If herd testing reveals one
or more animals that test positive to the official test for brucellosis (brucellosis reactors), all other animals
in the herd are considered brucellosis exposed. Brucellosis reactor cattle and brucellosis exposed cattle may move
interstate only in accordance with subpart B of part 78 (  78.5 through 78.14), to control the spread of
brucellosis. 

If a herd is quarantined in lieu of testing following epidemiologic investigation of an MCI reactor herd, the quarantine
protects against the possibility that the herd may be infected and could spread brucellosis. 

Herd testing or quarantine only occur for MCI reactor cases that are ``successfully closed'' (defined below). The
larger the number of MCI reactor cases that are not successfully closed, the greater the possibility that brucellosis
could spread from herds associated with the uninvestigated MCI reactors. Therefore, we are proposing to require
that a minimum percentage of MCI reactor cases must be successfully closed. 

We would consider MCI reactor cases that have been traced to the farm of origin to be successfully closed when: (1) An
epidemiologic investigation is completed within specified time limits; and (2) the herd is tested, or State or APHIS
animal health officials confine the animals to their premises under quarantine; or (3) State or APHIS animal health
officials determine there is justification for not testing the herd or quarantining it. We propose to add to  78.1
a definition of ``successfully closed case'' that reflects this standard for successful closure.

For Class Free and Class A States, animal health officials would have to complete the epidemiologic investigation
within 15 days after they are notified by the cooperative State-Federal laboratory that brucellosis reactors were
found on an MCI test. For Class B and Class C States, the time limit would be 30 days. This time standard for completing
the epidemiologic investigation is the same standard required in the current regulations. Experience with brucellosis
program operations has shown the time limits to be long enough to be workable for animal health officials, and short
enough to support effective controls on the spread of brucellosis. 

We believe there are circumstances that would constitute acceptable justification for not testing or quarantining
a herd following an MCI reactor traceback. The current regulations merely state that herd testing or quarantine will
be employed ``[W]hen required by the results of the epidemiologic investigation.'' We would like to provide more
specific guidance concerning when it would be justified to forego herd testing or quarantine. 

We are proposing to require that herd blood tests be conducted or the herd be confined to the premises under quarantine
within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist
determines that: 

1. The brucellosis reactor is located in a herd in a different State than the State where the MCI blood sample was collected.
In such cases a State representative or APHIS representative must give written notice of the MCI test results to the
State animal health official in the State where the brucellosis reactor is located; or, 

2. Evidence indicates that the brucellosis reactor is from a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis,
or is from a herd that is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis. Such evidence could include, but is not limited to,
situations where: 

a. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that has been sold for slaughter in entirety. In this case, the potential
for the herd to spread brucellosis no longer exists. 

b. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that is certified brucellosis free and is 100-percent vaccinated.
In such cases it is probable that the MCI test was a false positive, due to a titer caused by the vaccine. 

c. The brucellosis reactor showed a low titer on the MCI test and is traced back to a dairy herd that is 100 percent vaccinated
and has tested negative to the most recent brucellosis ring test required by the regulations. This is another case
where the probability of a false positive or other error in the MCI test is far greater than the probability that the
herd of origin is affected by brucellosis. 

Animal health officials could report a traceback to a farm of origin in another State as a successfully closed case
because we do not expect animal health officials to conduct epidemiologic investigations and herd testing in another
State. However, as part of successfully closing the case we would require them to notify in writing the State animal
health official in the State where the farm of origin is located so officials in that State could take proper follow-up
action. 

Under this proposal, Class Free and Class A States and areas would need to successfully close at least 95 percent of
the MCI reactor cases traced to the farm of origin, and Class B and Class C States and areas would need to successfully
close at least 90 percent of such cases. This means that 1 in 20 MCI reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class Free
and Class A States, and 1 in 10 reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class B and Class C States. 

If adopted, this proposal would reduce current recordkeeping requirements for the States. While State officials
would still need to compile data, the time involved should be much less than what is currently required for computing
the MCI reactor prevalence rate. Under our proposal, States would focus their recordkeeping on a fairly small number
of MCI reactors, rather than the much larger number of cattle with negative MCI test results. States would no longer
need to count all cattle tested, separate out cattle from other States, and then calculate an MCI reactor prevalence
rate based on the number of their State's cattle that were tested and the number of MCI reactors found through such testing.
Instead, each State would need to include in its annual report to APHIS the percentage of MCI reactor cases it successfully
closes. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the
Department, we have determined that this proposed rule: 

(1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 

(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 
(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 

Only State animal health agencies would be affected by this proposed rule; it would have no effect on the private sector.
State animal health officials would need to provide information on only the MCI reactors detected each month instead
of total numbers of MCI test cattle slaughtered. They would also need to maintain records of the numbers of MCI reactor
cases that are successfully closed and report the percentage of successfully closed cases annually to APHIS. The
States are already required to carry out the activities that constitute successful case closure. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:


(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; 

(2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and 

(3) Administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

conduct an epidemiologic investigation at the farm of origin within 30 days after notification by the cooperative
State-Federal laboratory that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test. Herd blood tests must be conducted
or the herd must be confined to the premises under quarantine within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors
were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist determines that:

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to modify the current Class D airspace and to establish a Class E extension to the Class D surface
area at Roswell, NM. This action proposes to amend a previous airspace action that established a 14.8 NM Class D airspace
extension to the Class D surface area for Roswell, NM. Because the arrival extension is greater than two miles, it should
have been classified as Class E airspace. However, it was incorrectly classified as Class D airspace. The intended
effect of this proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a class
E airspace extension to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain
IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center.

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class D
airspace at Roswell, NM. The current Class D airspace at Roswell Industrial Air Center, NM, was modified by rulemaking
action dated December 12, 1993 (58 FR 63885). That modification included an extension of the Class D airspace within
3.7 miles each side of the Chisum Very High Omni-Directional Radio Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) 290
  radial extending from the 5.0-mile radius to 14.8 miles northwest of the airport. That extension to the Class
D airpace in excess of 2 nautical miles should have been classified as Class E airspace. The intended effect of this
proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a Class E airspace extension
to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and
require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as extensions to Class D surface areas are published in Paragraph
6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection
with the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The proposed rule increases some of the fees based
on updates of estimates of direct costs to the Board of providing these services and adds a fee for transmittal of documents
by other than regular mail.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the
processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication,
and review. The fees currently provided for in  200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing
requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. Consequently,
the Board proposes to increase these fees presently found in  200.4(g) and to add a new paragraph to provide a
charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post.




The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact
analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this proposed rule within the meaning
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.



List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 200




Railroad employees, Railroad retirement, Railroad unemployment insurance.


For the reasons set out in the preamble, title 20, chapter II, part 200 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed
to be amended as follows:

Assessment or Waiver of Interest, Penalties, and Administrative Costs With Respect To Collection of Certain Debts




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Railroad Retirement Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend its regulations to clarify when interest and penalties begin
to accrue on an amount owed to the Board under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 200.7(b)(2) of the Board's regulations provides that:





Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt and demand for repayment with interest is first mailed
or hand-delivered to the debtor, or in the case of a debt which is subject to section 10(c) of the Railroad Retirement
Act or section 2(d) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, interest shall accrue from the date that a denial of
waiver or recovery is mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor or, if waiver has not been requested, upon the expiration
of the time within which to request wavier, except as otherwise specified in this section.




Section 200.7(c) of the regulations provides that:




(1) A penalty charge of 6 percent per year shall be assessed on any debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.

(2) The penalty charge shall accrue from the date on which the debt became delinquent.

(3) A debt is delinquent if it has not been paid in full by the 30th day after the date on which the initial demand letter
was first mailed or hand-delivered, or, if the debt is being repaid under an installment payment agreement, at any
time after the debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation for payment thereunder.




Section 12(o) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides that benefits payable to an employee with respect
to days of sickness shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay damages for such infirmity. The
Board shall be entitled to reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such employee or other person through
suits, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a liability under
health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have
paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom
such right or claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such right or claim, any judgment obtained
thereunder, and any sum or damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount to which the Board is entitled
by way of reimbursement.

Section 341.6 of the Board's regulations provides that a person or company subject to the lien must notify the agency
within five days of a settlement or judgment and must pay the agency the amount withheld to satisfy the lien within 30
days. In the case where a lien arises in favor of the Board as a result of a settlement or judgment but the Board is not notified
of the settlement or judgment in a timely manner, the employer or third party who has been served with a Notice of Lien
and notice of the amount of that lien already has notice of the existence and amount of the debt. Accordingly, interest
should accrue from the date of settlement or judgment, but would be waived if paid within 30 days in accordance with
 200.7(g)(1) of the Board's regulations.




Likewise, a section 12(o) debt should be considered delinquent if the lien is not satisfied within 30 days after settlement
or entry of judgment.




Consequently, the Board proposes to amend  200.7 of its regulations to provide for the accrual of interest on
section 12(o) debts and for the accrual of penalties on such debts when they become delinquent.




The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866; therefore,
no regulatory impact analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this rule.

Notice of public meetings. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 
International Society of Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology (ISRTP) are announcing forthcoming public meetings
to discuss the latest toxicologic and epidemiologic studies and how they reflect on issues related to the safe use
of talc in consumer products.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25204 at 25232), FDA proposed talc, 45 to 100 percent, as Category I (generally recognized as
safe and effective and not misbranded) as an OTC skin protectant active ingredient for the treatment and prevention
of diaper rash. Specific warnings and directions were proposed for powder products containing talc. The final monograph
for OTC skin protectant drug products will be published in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

. The discussion of talc at these public meetings may be considered by the agency in the preparation of this final monograph
for OTC skin protectant drug products.


The purpose of these meetings is to provide a forum for an updated discussion of the origins, manufacture, characterization,
toxicology, and epidemiology of talc and related products. The principal focus will be on the latest toxicologic
and epidemiologic studies, particularly as they reflect on the safe uses of talc in consumer products.
The following topic areas will be discussed: (1) Characteristics of cosmetic-grade talc; (2) a history of the uses
of talc in a variety of consumer products; (3) current quality control measures to insure safety; (4) the regulatory
history of talc; (5) recent National Toxicology Program studies of chronic pulmonary exposure of rodents to talc
and the relevance of these studies to human risk assessment; and (6) the significance of contrasting epidemiologic
studies of talc exposure. 
Speakers and panelists will include well-known regulatory specialists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, pathologists,
talc product manufacturers, talc production experts, and consumer representatives. A critical panel discussion
by speakers and invited experts will complete each session.

Amendments to Highway Safety Program Guidelines



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department
of Transportation (DOT).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 2002 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Highway Safety Programs,
requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs include six critical programs. The existing
18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA, but do not specifically
address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. The agencies therefore propose to amend the regulations by adopting
guidelines for these two programs. The agencies also propose to issue a guideline on Roadway Safety, corresponding
to the Roadway Safety Priority Program Area.



In addition to three new guidelines, the agencies propose to revise six of the existing 18 guidelines to reflect new
issues and to emphasize program methodology and approaches which have proven to be especially successful in these
program areas. The guidelines the agencies propose to revise are as follows:




Guideline No. 3 Motorcycle Safety
Guideline No. 8 Alcohol in Relation to Highway Safety
Guideline No. 10 Traffic Records
Guideline No. 11 Emergency Medical Services
Guideline No. 14 Pedestrian Safety
Guideline No. 15 Police Traffic Services



The agencies believe that the proposed revisions will provide more detailed guidance to the States.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



Section 402 of the Highway Safety Act of 1966 directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate uniform standards
for State highway safety programs, specified the subjects of several standards, and required States to conform to
these uniform standards or risk losing portions of their Federal-aid highway funds. Between 1967 and 1972, the Secretary
promulgated 18 Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs (published at 23 CFR part 1204).

Until 1976, the section 402 program was principally directed at achieving State and local conformance with the 18
Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions available
for non-compliance. In 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the Secretary
would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard.
As a result, the standards became guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program shifted from one focused
upon enforcing program standards to one focused upon problem identification, countermeasure development and evaluation,
with the standards to be used as a framework for the State programs. Few changes have been made in the guidelines since
that time.

Section 2002 of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs
include programs: (1) To reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of the posted
speed limits; (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and
child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles
equipped with airbags; (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired
by alcohol or a controlled substance; (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from crashes involving motor vehicles
and motorcycles; (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from crashes involving school buses; and (6) to improve
law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures.

Four of the areas represented by these six guidelines (i.e., Impaired Driving, Occupant Protection, Motorcycle
Safety, and Police Traffic Services) have previously been identified as National Priority Program Areas (under
23 CFR part 1205). Other Priority Areas include Emergency Medical Services, Pedestrian/Bicycle Safety, Traffic
Records, and Roadway Safety. Although Speed Control and School Bus Safety are not currently Priority Areas, the agencies
are now engaged in another rulemaking action and in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

 are considering whether to amend 23 CFR part 1205 to include Speed Control and/or School Buses as National Priority
Program Areas. Further, the Guideline for Pupil Transportation was revised in April of 1991 and needs no further revision
at this time. In addition, section 4002 of ISTEA requires that State agencies which receive Motor Carrier Safety Assistance
Program (MCSAP) grants coordinate their respective commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety enforcement plans with
the State highway safety agency (49 CFR 350). FHWA administers the MCSAP.






Proposed Addition of Three New Guidelines




The existing 18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA;
they do not specifically address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. Therefore, the agencies propose to issue
two new guidelines: Highway Safety Program Guideline No. 19, Speed Control; and Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 20, Occupant Protection. Though Speed Control has always been a component of the Police Traffic Services Priority
Area, it requires special attention in light of the involvement of speed in many traffic crashes. The agencies also
intend to take this opportunity to propose issuance of one additional guideline, which would be identified as Highway
Safety Program Guideline No. 21, Roadway Safety. The Roadway Safety Guideline is a consolidation of the key aspects
of various Guidelines which relate to the roadway. The addition of these new guidelines will result in a formal guideline
corresponding to each of the current National Priority Program Areas. Because the vast majority of all highway safety
projects funded under title 23 U.S.C. 402 are designed to address one or more of these Priority Program Areas, the existence
of corresponding guidelines for each will be of great value to the States and communities in the design and implementation
of highway safety programs.



Proposed Guideline 

#

19: Speed Control



The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA. Over the course of the agency's history,
NHTSA has funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Some common conclusions from
these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling
in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists.

Historically, Speed Control has not been separately identified as a National Priority Program Area under 23 CFR part
1204. It has, however, been an integral part of the Priority Program Area involving Police Traffic Services, resulting
in numerous programs at the State and local levels. In addition, the FHWA, through the MCSAP, supports speed control
initiatives as part of an overall traffic enforcement program aimed specifically at commercial motor vehicles.
The agencies are currently engaged in rulemaking to add Speed Control as a separate National Priority Program Area.
This proposed guideline is written to assist States and communities in the design and implementation of effective
Speed Control Programs. The guideline sets forth recommendations for the development and management of effective
speed control plans, visible public information and education efforts to gain voluntary compliance, promotion
of the use of new technology in the enforcement of speed laws, the establishment of safe and reasonable speed limits,
and effective training for police officers involved in speed control.

Proposed Guideline 

#

20: Occupant Protection


When the original highway safety program standards were established by NHTSA and FHWA, an occupant protection program
was not among them. Although lap and shoulder belts have been required for front outboard positions and lap belts for
all other seating positions in all passenger cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1968, belt usage remained very low
through the 1970's. In 1970, under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, FHWA required drivers of commercial
motor vehicles in interstate commerce to use a safety belt if it was installed in the vehicle. During the 1980's, States
participating in MCSAP adopted this requirement for commercial motor vehicle drivers in intrastate commerce. During
the 1970's, a national Highway Safety Needs Study indicated that significant reductions in highway losses could
be achieved with increased public use of occupant protection devices. NHTSA began to explore promotional activities
to encourage the public to buckle up.
In 1982, the agencies issued a final rule which identified six National Priority Program Areas that were considered
the most effective in reducing highway deaths and injuries. Occupant Protection was included as one of the six most
effective programs.
Although the agencies never issued a highway safety program standard or guideline, occupant protection has remained
a National Priority Program Area. Recognition of the importance of this program increased substantially during
the 1980's with evidence that safety belts are effective in preventing death and serious injury in 40-50 percent
of all crashes; passage or upgrading of child safety seat usage laws in every State; passage of safety belt use laws
in a majority of States; major increases in funding at the Federal, State and local levels; and significant increases
in occupant protection use rates. The agencies have conducted two subsequent rulemakings to review the effectiveness
of the Priority Program Areas. No comments have been received from the public suggesting that the area of occupant
protection should be deleted from the list of National Priorities.
The life-saving benefits of occupant protection programs are now widely recognized. The proposed Occupant Protection
program guideline has been prepared to provide current information on effective program elements for States to use
in producing and assessing their programs. The proposed guideline reflects the experience of States in program content
and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety programs relating to occupant protection. The guideline
sets forth recommendations for effective management and evaluation of occupant protection programs, legislative
initiatives and employment policies mandating use of occupant protection devices, strategic efforts to enforce
use laws and policies, public information efforts to reinforce use laws or policies and to inform the public of enforcement
efforts, and education programs to promote occupant protection through various organizations including health
and medical groups, schools, and employers throughout the State.


Proposed Guideline 

#

21: Roadway Safety


When the original 18 standards were established under the Highway Safety Act of 1966, FHWA was responsible for developing
and implementing programs relating to the roadway environment. Thus, Standards 9, 12, 13, and the roadway-related
aspects of Standard 14 (Pedestrian Safety) fell under FHWA's purview. In 1981, when FHWA and NHTSA identified six
highway safety program areas which were considered the most effective, and thus designated National Priority Program
Areas, one of the six was FHWA's Safety Construction and Operational Improvements.
In 1987, when the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of the various programs and retained the six priority areas,
the Safety Construction and Operational Improvement Priority Program was changed to ``Roadway Safety'' to encompass
a wider breadth of safety activities which are related to the driving environment. Roadway Safety involves various
highway safety activities which relate to safety aspects of the roadway environment. Currently, many roadway safety-related
activities are described in three of the original Highway Safety Program Guidelines:



Guideline 

#

9 Identification and Surveillance of Accident Locations
Guideline 

#

12 Highway Design, Construction and Maintenance
Guideline 

#

13 Traffic Engineering Services



Further, there are additional roadway-related activities included in the pedestrian and bicycle safety initiatives
which are outlined in the Pedestrian and Bicycle Guideline No. 14.

<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In order to more effectively organize and consolidate the roadway safety components from each of these various guidelines,
the agencies propose to create a new guideline entitled ``Roadway Safety''. While the four related guidelines will
remain unchanged, the new Roadway Safety Guideline highlights selected aspects from these four guidelines which
are recommended to be included in any State Roadway Safety program. 

The addition of these three new guidelines will ensure that guidelines reflecting the current state-of-the-art
are available for each of the National Priority Program Areas listed at 23 CFR part 1205. 



Proposed Revision of Six Existing Guidelines 



Since the original program standards were issued in the early 1970's, much has changed in both technology and societal
behavior which affects the methodology and approach to solving highway safety problems. When the standards were
originally issued, there were no State laws requiring safety belt or child safety seat use, there was little public
awareness about drunk driving, and highway safety was not yet a matter of great public concern. Because the highway
safety environment has changed so dramatically during the past twenty years, the agencies propose to update the guidelines
to provide current information on effective program content for States to use in producing and assessing their traffic
safety programs. Each of the proposed revised guidelines reflects the experience of States in traffic safety program
content and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety. They provide a framework for producing and
assessing a balanced highway safety program and a tool with which States can assess the effectiveness of their own
programs. 

The agencies propose to update only those guidelines which correspond to the programs currently designated as Priority
Areas. The agencies strongly believe that focusing attention on the priority programs has the greatest impact on
highway safety. The revised guidelines will emphasize these areas of national concern and highlight the effective
countermeasures which are available, while continuing to permit States to receive funding for additional areas
of local concern when justified, and thus ensure that section 402 resources are being allocated in the most effective
manner.

Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 3_Motorcycle Safety



The elements of the present Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 address the following safety issues: (1) Preventing
or reducing the severity of head injuries; (2) determining whether novice motorcyclists have the basic skills; and
(3) assuring that the vehicles have minimum safety equipment and are adequately maintained.

The proposed new Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 continues to emphasize the importance of motorcyclists wearing
helmets and places great emphasis on improving the knowledge and skills of all motorcycle operators through motorcycle
rider education and training programs. The guideline also strongly encourages states and communities to develop
comprehensive motorcycle safety programs that address (1) the effective management of the program through a central
or lead agency; (2) the requirement for special licensing exams; (3) the influence of alcohol and other drugs on motorcyclists;
and (4) the issues of motorcycle conspicuity and motorist awareness.



Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 8_Alcohol in Relation to Highway Safety



The current Guideline No. 8 contains the elements which provide the basic structure underlying the drinking and driving
laws of the states. These include the use of chemical tests, the establishment of a BAC value (.10%) which is presumptive
evidence of intoxication and the enactment of laws establishing the ``implied consent'' of a motorist to submit to
a chemical test. The other components of the current guideline relate to the collection of data on alcohol-related
fatalities, and the specifications and qualifications of chemical testing equipment and personnel administering
the tests. The primary effort of the guideline was to establish some reasonable conformity with a uniform legal basis
for detecting and prosecuting drunk drivers.

Under the current guideline, the States follow a ``specific deterrence'' approach designed to remove from the road
those who had been arrested for DWI. However, the majority of alcohol-related crashes involve drivers with no previous
DWI arrest; moreover, the majority of intoxicated drivers on the road go undetected.

The proposed Guideline No. 8, entitled ``Impaired Driving'', reflects a comprehensive, community-based approach
with goals of (1) preventing people from being killed and injured in the short-term through general deterrence programs,
and (2) permanently reducing the number of drinking and drugged drivers through long-term prevention and intervention
measures.

Under the general deterrence approach, the objective is to increase the perceived risk by the drinking driver that
he or she will be caught and convicted of DWI. The proposed guideline recommends states establish a BAC value of .08%
as the illegal per se level, at or above which a drive is considered to be driving while intoxicated; implement specific
countermeasures designed to better equip and train police officers in recognizing, tracking, and arresting impaired
drivers; enable prompt suspension of drivers licenses through streamlined administrative procedures; result
in punitive action such as fines, community service, jail or the suspension of driving privileges; and ensure the
public is fully aware of the increased enforcement efforts.

Under the ``prevention and intervention'' approach, the guideline recommends strategies which are aimed at permanently
changing the public's attitudes and behaviors concerning drinking and driving. These include public information
and education for students in schools and colleges, for adults through programs in the workplace and for the general
population through programs in health care settings. Other education efforts include promotion of designated driver
programs, responsible alcohol service efforts, citizen support and outreach efforts, and the establishment of
self-sufficient programs requiring offenders to defray program costs.

The States should also be aware of and enforce alcohol and drug requirements for CMV drivers. The FHWA established
a BAC level of .04 percent as the threshold at which a CMV driver is considered to be under the influence of alcohol and
subject to disqualification from driving ranging from one year to life. In addition, a CMV driver found to have any
measurable or detectable alcohol level in his or her system while operating a CMV is prohibited from driving for 24
hours. FHWA also requires motor carriers to have specific drug testing programs of CMV drivers in place.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 10_Traffic Records


The current Traffic Records Guideline is directed toward improving the operational efficiency of record systems
involving crash statistics, driver licensing, vehicle registration, vehicle inspection, traffic citations,
roadway related data, EMS, and driver education. In the past, however, the operational condition of many of these
record systems maintained by the States was insufficient to provide a reliable total information base. The growth
of the files as well as increased processing costs caused administrators to seek methods of modernizing the files
and improving compatibility of related systems.
The proposed Guideline No. 10 recommends methods to establish comprehensive traffic records systems to enable states
to use data to identify emerging traffic safety problems, develop appropriate countermeasures, and evaluate program
performance. The guideline focuses attention on the need to link computer systems, establish uniform data elements
including CMV crash data and integrate data elements where appropriate. In addition, the proposed guideline suggests
innovative driver licensing techniques that will effectively identify problem drivers whose driver licenses have
been suspended or revoked in other states.


Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 11_Emergency Medical Services


The current Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Guideline No. 11 is based upon the philosophy that by improving pre-hospital
emergency medical services in general, the system will serve the highway-injured patient better. The focus of programs
under this guideline has been upon those elements of emergency medical care which precede the patient's arrival in
a hospital emergency department. This includes setting standards and requirements for qualified and trained personnel,
the types and number of ambulances and other emergency response vehicles, communication systems and equipment,
and coordination with other components of the medical care system.
With the maturing of the nationwide EMS Program, the proposed EMS Guideline No. 11 reflects a new emphasis and expanded
focus for emergency medical services. The proposed guideline recommends improvements to the entire emergency medical
services system for highway-injured patients. The elements deemed most effective in improving trauma care for the
highway-injured patient include a common phone number (e.g., 9-1-1) for quick public access, communication
between ambulances and hospitals, trained first responders and pre-hospital personnel, adequate and appropriate
transportation coverage, highly trained in-hospital personnel at specialized trauma care centers, pre-hospital
and hospital coordination, and improved data on trauma patients. The proposed guideline also recommends improved
public information, education and injury prevention efforts.


Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 14_Pedestrian Safety


The current Pedestrian Guideline No. 14 does not address Bicycle Safety Programs. The guideline was developed when
Pedestrian Safety was not a National Priority Program Area and before many countermeasures were proven to be effective.
The current guideline is narrowly focused on single issue countermeasure activities which involved primarily the
inventory of the pedestrian problem; education, particularly aimed at young school children; and engineering.
In a NHTSA/FHWA joint NPRM published in the 

Federal Register 

on May 3, 1991, the agencies stated that effective countermeasures have been developed to address both Pedestrian
and Bicycle safety problems and specifically, concerns caused by an increase in the elderly population and the growth
in popularity of walking, jogging and bicycling. On October 4, 1991, a Final Rule was issued making Pedestrian and
Bicycle Safety a National Priority program area.
The proposed Guideline No. 14 addresses both pedestrian and bicycle safety and describes countermeasures that are
comprehensive in nature, involve a multi-disciplinary approach. These require the combined and coordinated support
of law enforcement, education, public health, driver education and licensing, transportation engineering, and
public communications. In addition, the guideline provides for legislative and regulatory solutions, outlines
methods to enlist the support of individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community,
features innovative school-based practices, and highlights traffic engineering components that promote pedestrian
and bicycle safety while reducing traffic congestion.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 15_Police Traffic Services 



The current Police Traffic Service Guideline No. 15 emphasizes the use of police patrols to enforce traffic laws,
improve traffic flow, prevent crashes, aid the injured, document each crash, supervise cleanup, and restore traffic
flow. The guideline provides minimum standards by which a police department can measure its quality in traffic services,
and suggests uniform training procedures, as well as standardized records and reporting systems. The guideline
also addresses selective assignment of personnel and coordination with other agencies and neighboring jurisdictions
and recommends in-service training for police personnel. 

The proliferation of highway safety legislation in recent years, such as tougher DWI laws, child restraint and seat
belt use laws, and commercial motor vehicle safety laws, combined with an increased demand for other law enforcement
services, has placed a strain on police agencies during a time of reduced budgets, manpower and resources. The proposed
Guideline No. 15 assists law enforcement agencies by addressing how to do more with less. Such efforts include developing
and participating in comprehensive programs; enlisting support of the media, community leaders, business and volunteer/activist
groups; developing resource management plans; and training officers in state-of-the-art enforcement curricula.




Other Guidelines Remain Unchanged 



The following 12 guidelines currently contained in  1204 will remain intact and unchanged by this proposal:





Guideline No. 1 Periodic Motor Vehicle Inspection

Guideline No. 2 Motor Vehicle Registration

Guideline No. 4 Driver Education

Guideline No. 5 Driver Licensing

Guideline No. 6 Codes and Laws 

Guideline No. 7 Traffic Courts

Guideline No. 9 Identification and Surveillance of Accident Locations

Guideline No. 12 Highway Design, Construction, and Maintenance

Guideline No. 13 Traffic Engineering Services 

Guideline No. 16 Debris Hazard Control and Cleanup

Guideline No. 17 Pupil Transportation Safety (Rev. 4/91)

Guideline No. 18 Accident Investigation and Reporting






It should be noted that the guidelines are not binding on the States. A State's decision not to adopt a portion of a guideline,
for example, would not entail penalties for the State. Nonetheless, the agencies encourage the use of the recommendations
contained in these guidelines to optimize the effectiveness of highway safety programs conducted at the State and
local level. 



Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted. 

In order to expedite the submission of comments, copies of this notice are being mailed to all Governors, Governors'
Representatives for Highway Safety, and State EMS Directors. 

Comments should not exceed 15 pages in length. Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without
regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments
in a concise fashion. 

All comments received before the closing date indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examination
in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the
closing date will also be considered. However, the revisions to these guidelines may proceed at any time after that
date. The agencies will continue to file relevant material in the docket as it becomes available after the closing
date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. 

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the docket should enclose, in the envelope
with their comments, a pre-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will
return the postcard by mail. 



Economic and Other Effects 



The agencies have considered the impacts that would be associated with this proposed action, and determined that
it is not significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or the Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures. The guidelines contained in part 1204 are advisory, not mandatory. Accordingly, a full
regulatory evaluation is not necessary. 

Since this matter relates to grants, the notice and comment requirements established in the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, are not applicable. Because the agencies are not required to published a notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding this rule, the agencies are not required to analyze the effect of this rule on small entities, in accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The agencies have nonetheless evaluated the effects of this notice on small
entities. Based on the evaluation, I certify that this notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, the preparation of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is unnecessary.



Environmental Impacts 



The agencies have also analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act. The agencies
have determined that this action will not have any effect on the human environment. 



Federalism Assessment 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
it has been determined that it has no federalism implication that warrants the preparation of a federalism assessment.




List of Subjects in 23 CFR Part 1204

Highway Safety Program Guideline

No. 3

Motorcycle Safety



Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive program to promote motorcycle
safety. To be effective in reducing the number of motorcycle crash deaths and injuries, State programs should address
the use of helmet and other protective gear, proper licensing, impaired riding, rider training, conspicuity, and
motorist awareness. This Motorcycle Safety Program Guideline will assist States and local communities in the development
and implementation of effective motorcycle safety programs.



I. Program Management



Each State should identify the nature and extent of its motorcycle safety problems, establish goals and objectives
for the State's motorcycle safety program, and implement projects to reach the goals and objectives. State motorcycle
safety plans should:




Designate a lead agency for motorcycle safety;

Develop funding sources;

Collect and analyze data on motorcycle safety;

Identify the State's motorcycle safety problem areas;

Develop programs (with specific projects) to address problems;

Coordinate motorcycle projects with those for the general motoring public; and

Integrate motorcycle safety into community traffic safety programs.



II. Motorcycle Personal Protective Equipment



Each State should encourage motorcycle operators and passengers to use the following protective equipment:




Motorcycle helmets (which should be required by law);

Proper clothing, including gloves, boots, long pants, and a durable long-sleeved jacket; and

Eye (which should be required by law) and face protection.




Additionally, each passenger should be provided a seat and footrest.



III. Motorcycle Operator Licensing



States should require every person who operates a motorcycle on public roadways to pass an examination designed especially
for motorcycle operation and to hold a license endorsement specifically authorizing motorcycle operation. Each
State should have a motorcycle licensing system that requires:




Motorcycle operator's manual;

Motorcycle license examination, including knowledge and skill tests, and State licensing medical criteria;

License examiner training;

Motorcycle license endorsement;

Motorcycle license renewal requirements;

Learner's permit issued for a period of 90 days and only twice per applicant; and

Penalties for violation of motorcycle licensing requirements.



IV. Motorcycle Rider Education and Training



Safe motorcycle operation requires specialized training by qualified instructors. Each State should establish
a State Motorcycle Rider Education Program that provides for:




Source of program funding;

State organization to administer the program;

Use of Motorcycle Safety Foundation curriculum or equivalent State-approved curriculum;

Reasonable availability of rider education courses for all interested residents of legal riding age;

Instructor training and certification;

Incentives for successful course completion such as licensing skills test exemption;

V. Motorcycle Operation Under the Influence of Alcohol or Other Drugs 



Each State should ensure that programs addressing drunk and drugged driving include a focus on motorcycles. The following
programs should include an emphasis on impaired motorcyclists. 




Community traffic safety programs; 

Public information and education campaigns; 

Youth impaired driving programs; 

Law enforcement programs; 

Judge and prosecutor training programs; 

Anti-drunk and drugged driving organizations; and 

College and school programs. 



VI. Motorcycle Conspicuity and Motorist Awareness Programs 


State motorcycle safety programs should emphasize the issues of rider conspicuity and motorist awareness of motorcycles.
These programs should address: 




Daytime use of motorcycle lights; 

Brightly colored clothing and reflective materials for motorcycle riders; 

Lane positioning of motorcycles to increase vehicle visibility; 

Reasons why motorists do not see motorcycles; and 

Ways that other motorists can increase their awareness of motorcyclists. 


* * * * *



Highway Safety Program Guideline 

No. 8 

Impaired Driving 



Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive program to combat impaired
driving. This guideline describes the areas that each State's program should address. Throughout this guideline,
``impaired driving'' means operating any motor vehicle while one's faculties are affected by alcohol or other drugs,
medications, or other substances. ``Impaired driving'' includes, but is not limited to, impairment as defined in
State statutes. 



I. Prevention 



Each State should have prevention programs to reduce impaired driving through approaches commonly associated with
public health_altering social norms, changing risky or dangerous behaviors, and creating protective environments.
Prevention and public health programs promote activities to educate the public on the effects of alcohol and other
drugs, limit alcohol and drug availability, and prevent those impaired by alcohol and drugs from driving. Prevention
programs are typically carried out in schools, work sites, medical and health care facilities, and community groups.
Each State should implement a system of impaired driving prevention activities and to work with the public health
community to foster health and reduce traffic-related injuries. 



A. Public Information and Education for Prevention 



States should develop and implement public information and education (PI&E) programs directed at impaired
driving. Programs should start at the State level and extend to communities through State assistance, model programs,
and public encouragement. States should: 




Have a statewide plan, program, and coordinator for all impaired driving PI&E activities; 

Develop their own PI&E campaigns and materials, either by adapting materials from the Federal government or
other States, or by creating new campaigns and materials; 

Encourage and support communities to implement awareness programs at the local level; 

Encourage businesses and private organizations to participate in impaired driving PI&E campaigns; and 

Encourage media to support impaired driving highway safety issues by reporting on programs, activities (including
enforcement campaigns), alcohol-related arrests, and alcohol-related crashes.

<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

B. School Programs


Student programs, including kindergarten through college and trade school, play a critical role in preventing impaired
driving. States should:



Implement K-12 traffic safety education, with appropriate emphasis on impaired driving, as part of a comprehensive
health education program;
Establish and support student safety clubs and activities and create a statewide network linking these groups;
Establish liaisons with higher education institutions to encourage policies to reduce alcohol, other drug, and
traffic safety problems on college campuses;
Promote alcohol- and drug-free events throughout the school year, with particular emphasis on high-risk times such
as prom, spring break, and graduation;
Coordinate closely with anti-drug education efforts and programs;
Develop working relationships with school health personnel as a means of providing information to students about
a variety of traffic safety and health behaviors; and
Make effective use of criminal justice, medical, or other professionals through presentations in the classroom
or assembly programs.


C. Employer Programs


States should provide information and technical assistance to all employers, encouraging them to offer programs
to reduce impaired driving by employees and their families. These programs should include:



Model policies for impaired driving and other traffic safety issues, including safety belt use and speeding;
Management training to recognize and address alcohol and drug impairment;
Education and treatment programs for employees; and 
Employee awareness activities.



States should especially encourage companies and businesses to provide impaired driving programs to their youthful
employees. The States should also be familiar with FHWA's drug and alcohol requirements for employers of CMV drivers.


D. Responsible Alcohol Service


States should promote responsible alcohol service policies and practices in the retail alcohol service industry,
including package stores, restaurants, and taverns, through well-publicized and enforced laws, regulations,
and policies. States should:



Implement and enforce programs to eliminate the sale of alcoholic beverages to those under 21 years of age;
Promote alcohol server and service programs, including assessments, written policies, and training;
Ensure adequate alcohol control regulations dealing with issues such as service to visibly intoxicated patrons,
elimination of ``happy hours'', and availability of food and non-alcoholic beverages;
Provide adequate resources (including budget, staff, and training) to enforce alcohol beverage control regulations;
Promote the display of responsible alcohol use and drinking and driving information in alcohol sales and service
establishments;
Promote establishment participation in designated driver, safe rides, and other alternative transportation programs;
and
Provide that commercial establishments may be held responsible for damages caused by any patron who was served alcohol
when visibly intoxicated.

E. Transportation Alternatives



States should promote alternative transportation programs that enable impaired drinkers to reach their destinations
without driving. Alternative transportation programs include:




Designated drivers; and

Safe rides.



II. Deterrence



Each State should have a deterrence program to reduce impaired driving through activities to create the maximum possible
perception of detection, arrest and punishment among persons who might be tempted to drive under the influence of
alcohol or other drugs, including CMV drivers. Close coordination with law enforcement agencies on the municipal,
county, and State levels is needed to create and sustain the perceived risk of being detected and arrested. Specialized
traffic enforcement efforts, such as MCSAP, also serve as a core element in the detection of impaired drivers. Equally
close coordination with courts and the motor vehicle licensing and registration agency is needed to enhance the fear
of punishment. Effective use of all available media is essential to create and maintain a strong public awareness
of impaired driving enforcement and sanctions.

Each State should implement a system of activities to deter impaired driving. The deterrence system should include
legislation, public information and education, enforcement, prosecution, adjudication, criminal sanctions,
driver licensing, and vehicle registration activities. The goal should be to increase the perception and probability
of arrest for violators and the imposition of swift and sure sanctions.



A. Laws To Deter Impaired Driving



States should enact laws that define and prohibit impaired driving in broad and readily enforceable terms, facilitates
the acquisition of evidence against impaired drivers, and permit a broad range of administrative and judicial penalties
and actions. These laws should:




Define impaired driving offenses_




Establish .08 Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) as the blood alcohol level at or above which it is illegal to operate
a motor vehicle (``illegal per se'');

Establish .04 BAC as the illegal per se blood alcohol level for commercial truck and bus operators, as provided by commercial
driver license regulations;

Establish that it is illegal per se for persons under the age of 21 (the legal drinking age) to drive with any measurable
amount of alcohol in their blood, breath, or urine;

Establish that driving under the influence of other drugs (whether illegal, prescription, or over-the-counter)
is unlawful and is treated similarly to driving under the influence of alcohol;

Establish vehicular homicide or causing personal injury while under the influence of alcohol as a separate offense;
and

Prohibit open alcohol containers and consumption of alcohol in motor vehicles.




Provide for effective enforcement of these laws_




Authorize police to conduct checkpoints, in which vehicles are stopped on a nondiscriminatory basis to determine
whether or not the operators are driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs;

Authorize police to use a preliminary breath test for a vehicle operator stopped for a suspected impaired driving
offense;

Authorize police to test for impairing drugs other than alcohol;

Include implied consent provisions that permit the use of chemical tests and that allow the arresting officer to require
more than one test of a vehicle operator stopped for a suspected impaired driving offense;

Require prompt and certain license revocation or suspension for persons who refuse to take a chemical test to determine
whether they were driving while intoxicated (``implied consent''); and

Require mandatory blood alcohol concentration testing whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe that a driver has committed an alcohol-related offense.




Provide effective penalties for these offenses_




Require prompt and certain administrative license revocation or suspension of at least 90 days for persons determined
by chemical test to violate the State's BAC limit;

Provide for increasingly more severe penalties for repeat offenders, including lengthy license revocation, substantial
criminal fines, jail, and/or impoundment or confiscation of license plates or vehicles registered by the offender;

Provide for more stringent criminal penalties for those convicted of more serious offenses, such as vehicular homicide;

Contain special provisions for youth under the age of 21 that mandate driver's license suspension for any violations
of laws regarding the use or possession of alcohol or other drugs; and

<TEXT>
 

Establish victim assistance and victim restitution programs and require the use of a victim impact statement prior
to sentencing in all Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) cases where death or serious injury occurred.


B. Public Information and Education for Deterrence


States should implement public information and education (PI&E) programs to maximize public perception of
the risks of being caught and punished for impaired driving. Public information programs should be:



Comprehensive;
Seasonally focused; and
Sustained.


C. Enforcement


States should implement comprehensive enforcement programs to maximize the likelihood of detecting, investigating,
arresting, and convicting impaired drivers. These programs should:



Secure a commitment to rigorous DWI enforcement from the top levels of police management and State and local government;
Provide state-of-the-art training for police officers, including Standardized Field Sobriety Testing (SFST)
and Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC);
Provide adequate equipment and facilities, including preliminary and evidentiary breath test equipment; 
Deploy patrol resources effectively, using cooperative efforts of various State and local police agencies as appropriate;

Maximize the likelihood of violator-officer contact; 
Make regular use of sobriety checkpoints;
Facilitate the arrest process;
Implement state-of-the-art post-arrest investigation of apprehended impaired drivers;
Emphasize enforcement of youth impaired driving and drinking age laws; and
Emphasize enforcement of laws regulating alcohol or drug impairment by CMV drivers.


D. Prosecution


States should implement a comprehensive program for visible and aggressive prosecution of impaired driving cases.
These programs should:



Give DWI cases high priority for prosecution;
Provide sufficient resources to prosecute cases presented by law enforcement efforts; 
Facilitate uniformity and consistency in prosecution of impaired driving cases; 
Provide training for prosecutors so they can obtain high rates of conviction and seek appropriate sanctions for offenders;
Prohibit plea bargaining in DWI cases, through appropriate legislation;

Encourage vigorous prosecution of alcohol-related fatality and injury cases under both DWI and general criminal
statutes; and
Ensure that prosecutors are knowledgeable and prepared to prosecute youthful offenders appropriately.


E. Adjudication


The effectiveness of prosecution and enforcement efforts is lost without support and strength in adjudication.
States should implement a comprehensive impaired driving adjudication program to:


Provide sufficient resources to adjudicate cases and manage the dockets brought before them;
Facilitate uniformity and consistency in adjudication of impaired driving cases;
Give judges the skills necessary to appropriately adjudicate impaired driving cases;
Provide similar training to administrative hearing officers who hear administrative license revocation appeals;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Inform the judiciary about technical evidence presented in impaired driving cases, including SFST and DEC testimony;
Educate the judiciary in appropriate and aggressive sanctions for offenders including violators of commercial
motor vehicle safety regulations; and
Ensure that judges are knowledgeable and prepared to adjudicate youthful offenders in an appropriate and aggressive
manner.


F. Licensing


Driver licensing actions can be an effective means for preventing, deterring, and monitoring impaired driving.
In addition to the license sanctions for impaired driving offenses discussed earlier, States should:



Issue provisional licenses to novice drivers;
Provide for license suspension for driver under age 21 who drives with a BAC exceeding .02 (or some other low value);
Issue distinctive licenses to drivers under the age of 21;
Monitor licensing records to identify high risk drivers for referral to education or remediation programs;
Ensure the accurate and timely reporting of alcohol and drug violations as proscribed by the Commercial Drivers License
(CDL) regulations;
Assure that all licensing records are used to help assess whether a driver requires alcohol or drug treatment; and
Actively participate in the Driver License Compact to facilitate the exchange of driver license information between
jurisdictions.


III. Treatment and Rehabilitation


Many first-time impaired driving offenders and most repeat offenders have substantial substance abuse problems
that affect their entire lives, not just their driving. They have been neither prevented nor deterred from impaired
driving. Each State should implement a system to identify and refer these drivers to appropriate substance abuse
treatment programs to change their dangerous behavior.


A. Diagnosis and Screening


States should have a systematic program to evaluate persons who have been convicted of an impaired driving offense
to determine if they have an alcohol or drug abuse problem. This evaluation should:



Be required by law;
Be conducted by qualified personnel prior to sentencing; and
Be used to decide whether a substance abuse treatment program should be part of the sanctions imposed.


B. Treatment and Rehabilitation


States should establish and maintain programs to treat alcohol and other drug dependent persons referred through
traffic courts and other sources. These programs should:



Ensure that those referred for impaired driving offenses are not permitted to drive again until their substance abuse
problems are under control;
Be conducted in addition to, not as a substitute for, license restrictions and other sanctions; and
Be conducted separately for youth.


IV. Program Management


Good program management produces effective programs. Planning and coordination are especially important for impaired
driving activities, since many different parties are involved. Each State's impaired driving program management
system should have an established process for managing its planning (including problem identification), program
control, and evaluation activities. The system should provide for community traffic safety programs (CTSPs), State
and local task forces, data analysis, and funding. It also should include planning and coordination of activities
with other agencies involved in impaired driving programs, such as MCSAP.


A. State Program Planning


States should develop and implement an overall plan for all impaired driving activities. The plan should:



Be based on careful problem definition that makes use of crash and driver record data; and
Direct State and community resources toward effective measures that address the State's impaired driving issues.


B. Program Control


States should establish procedures to ensure that program activities are implemented as intended. The procedures
should provide for systematic monitoring and review of ongoing programs to:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Detect and correct problems quickly;

Measure progress in achieving established goals and objectives; and

Ensure that appropriate data are collected for evaluation.



C. State and Local Task Forces and Community Traffic Safety Programs



States should encourage the development of State and community impaired driving task forces and community traffic
safety programs. States should:






Use these groups to bring a wide variety of interests and resources to bear on impaired driving issues; and

Ensure that Federal, State, and local organizations coordinate impaired driving activities, so that the activities
complement rather than compete with each other.



D. Data and Records



States should establish and maintain records systems for accidents, arrests, dispositions, driver licenses, and
vehicle registrations. Especially important are tracking systems which can provide information on every driver
arrested for DWI to determine the disposition of the case and compliance with sanctions. These records systems should
be:






Accurate;

Timely;

Able to be linked to each other; and 

Readily accessible to police, courts, and planners.



E. Evaluation



States should evaluate all impaired driving system activities regularly to ensure that programs are effective and
scarce resources are allocated appropriately. Evaluation should be:






Included in initial program planning to ensure that appropriate data are available and that adequate resources are
allocated;

Designed to use available traffic records systems effectively; and

Conducted regularly.






Evaluation results should be:






Reported regularly to project and program managers; and 

Used to guide further program activities.



F. Funding



States should allocate funding to impaired driving programs that is:






Adequate for program needs;

Steady_from dedicated sources; and 

To the extent possible, paid by the impaired drivers themselves. The programs should work toward being self-sufficient.

Highway Safety Program Guideline

No. 10

Traffic Records



Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should establish and implement a complete traffic records
program. The Statewide program should include, or provide for, data for the entire State. A complete traffic records
program is necessary for planning (problem identification), operational management or control, and evaluation
of a State's highway safety activities. This type of program is basic to identifying highway safety problems, tracking
safety trends, and implementing highway safety countermeasures. It is the key ingredient to safety effectiveness
and management. 



I. Traffic Records System



To provide a complete and useful records system for safety program management at both the State and local level, the
State should have a data base consisting of the following:






An Accident File with data on the time, environment, and circumstances of a crash; identification of the vehicles,
drivers, cyclists, occupants, and pedestrians involved; and documentation of crash consequences (fatalities,
injuries, property damage and violations charged) with the data tied to a location reference system;

A Driver File or driver history record of licensed drivers in the State, with data on personal identification and driver
license number, type of license, license status (suspended or revoked), driver restrictions, driver convictions
for traffic violations, crash history, driver control or improvement actions, and safety education data;

A Vehicle File with information on identification, ownership and taxation, and vehicle inspection (where applicable);


A Roadway File with information about roadway location, identification, and classification as well as a description
of a road's total physical characteristics, which is tied to a location reference system. This file should also contain
data for normalizing purposes, such as miles of roadway and average daily traffic (ADT);

A Commercial Motor Vehicle Crash File which uses uniform data definitions and collects information on the vehicle
configuration, cargo body type, hazardous materials, information to identify the motor carrier, as well as information
on the crash.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A Citation/Conviction File which identifies the type of citation and the time, date, and location of the violation;
the violator, vehicle and the enforcement agency; and adjudication action and results, including court of jurisdiction
(an Enforcement/Citation File could be maintained separate from a Judicial/Conviction File) and fines assessed
and collected;
An Emergency Medical Services (EMS) file with emergency care and victim outcome information about ambulance responses
to crashes, e.g., emergency care unit, care given, injury data, and times of EMS notification and arrival; information
on emergency facility and hospital care, including Trauma Registry data; and medical outcome data relative to crash
victims receiving rehabilitation and for those who died as the result of the crash, and
Provisions for file linkage through common data elements between the files or through other consistent means; performance
level data as part of the traffic records system; demographic data to normalize or adjust for exposure when analyzing
the various data in the files; and provisions for the use of cost data relative to amounts spent on countermeasure programs
and the costs of fatalities, injuries and property damage.


II. Data Characteristics


Traffic records programs should meet basic requirements for the most effective use of the data by program managers.
Accordingly, each State should emphasize the following characteristics:



An accurate identification of the crash location;
Timely and accurate data collection and input to all files, and especially to the Accident and Driver Files, to assure
maximum utilization and confidence in the traffic records system. Each state is encouraged to join and fully participate
in the driver license compact to ensure that complete data is available from other states;
Data uniformity, providing for uniform coding and definition of data elements to allow a State to compare its crash
problems to other States, regions and the nation; and the use of uniform coding of violations and convictions for the
efficient exchange of driver information between States;
Data consistency within a State over time to provide for multi-year analysis of data to detect trends and for identification
of emerging problems, as well as to determine beneficial effects of highway safety programs; and
Timely and complete data output to ensure that highway safety program managers will have records that are accessible,
understandable, and effective.


III. Use of Traffic Records


The measure of a good records system is the degree to which it is used by those it was designed to serve. Each State should
establish a process for the effective use of traffic records by highway safety management, including the following:



A management process which addresses the role or use of traffic records data in planning (including problem identification),
program control, and evaluation;
A problem identification strategy that specifies the necessary data, assures that accurate and timely data are available,
defines the analyses conducted (including the variables used, statistical tests applied, and trends examined),
and describes how results are reported and used;
Presentation of analysis results so that they are clearly understood and usable by managers, including the use of
problem reports which describe the magnitude of the problems, and appropriate graphs, tables and charts to support
the conclusions reached; and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Provisions for program evaluation, beginning at the planning stage and carrying through implementation and final
evaluation, essentially using the same types of data that were used in developing the programs implemented.



IV. Managing Traffic Records



Each State should have an organizational structure in place for effective administration of its traffic records
program, at a minimum consisting of the following components:




A permanent Traffic Records Committee, representing the principal users and custodians of the data in the State,
that provides administrative and technical guidance. The Committee should be responsible for adopting requirements
for file structure and linkage, assessing capabilities and resources, establishing goals for improving the traffic
records program, evaluating the program, continuously developing cooperation and support from State and local
agencies as well as the private sector, and ensuring that high quality and timely data are available to authorized
persons or agencies for appropriate use;

A single state agency with responsibility for coordinating the traffic safety-related data aspects of the various
State information systems. This would include ensuring that the necessary data were available for use in safety and
analyses; and

Professional staff with analytical expertise to perform data analysis for program planning and evaluation, including
a basic understanding of data processing as it relates to the use of personal computers (PCs) and the ability to use
PC software application packages to perform problem identification and program evaluation tasks.



Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 11
Emergency Medical Services



Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should ensure that persons incurring traffic injuries
(or other trauma) receive prompt emergency medical care under the range of emergency conditions encountered. Each
of the component parts of a system should be equally committed to its role in the system and ultimately to the care of
the patient. At a minimum, the EMS program should be made up of the components detailed in this chapter.



I. Regulation and Policy



Each State should embody comprehensive enabling legislation, regulations, and operational policies and procedures
to provide an effective system of emergency medical and trauma care. This legal framework should:




Establish the program and designate a lead agency;

Outline the lead agency's basic responsibilities, including licensure and certification;

Require comprehensive planning and coordination;

Designate EMS and trauma system funding sources;

Require data collection and evaluation; and

Provide authority to establish minimum standards and identify penalties for noncompliance.




Each of these components, which are discussed in different sections of this guideline, are critical to the effectiveness
of legislation that is the legal foundation for a statewide EMS system.



II. Resource Management



Each State should establish a central lead agency at the State level to identify, categorize, and coordinate resources
necessary for overall system implementation and operation. The lead agency should:




Maintain a coordinated response and ensure that resources are used appropriately throughout the State;

Provide equal access to basic emergency care for all victims of medical or traumatic emergencies;

Provide adequate triage and transport of all victims by appropriately certified personnel (at a minimum, trained
to the emergency medical technician [EMT] basic level) in properly licensed, equipped, and maintained ambulances;

Provide transport to a facility that is appropriately equipped, staffed, and ready to administer to the needs of the
patient (section 4: Transportation); and,

Appoint an advisory council to provide a forum for cooperative action and maximum use of resources.



III. Human Resources and Training



Each State should ensure that its EMS system has essential trained human resources to perform required tasks. These
personnel include: first responders (e.g., police and fire), prehospital providers (e.g., emergency medical technicians
and paramedics), communications specialists, physicians, nurses, hospital administrators, and planners.

Each State should provide a comprehensive statewide plan for stable and consistent EMS training programs with effective
local and regional support. The State agency should:




Ensure sufficient availability of adequately trained EMS personnel;

Establish EMT-Basic as the state minimum level of training for all transporting EMS personnel;

Routinely monitor training programs to ensure uniformity and quality control;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Use standardized curricula throughout the State; 

 Ensure availability of continuing education programs; 

 Require instructors to meet State requirements; 

 Develop and enforce certification criteria for first responders and prehospital providers; and 

 Require EMS operating organizations to collect data to evaluate emergency care in terms of frequency, category,
and severity as well as the use of appropriate knowledge and skills. 

 

IV. Transportation 

 

Each State should require safe, reliable ambulance transportation, which is critical to an effective EMS system.
States should:

 

 
Develop statewide transportation plans, including the identification of specific service areas; 

 Implement regulations that provide for the systematic delivery of patients to appropriate facilities; 

 Develop routine, standardized methods for inspection and licensing of all emergency medical transport vehicles;


 Establish a minimum number of providers at the desired level of certification on each response; 

 Coordinate all emergency transports within the EMS system, including public, private, or specialty (air and ground)
transport; and 

 Develop regulations to ensure ambulance drivers are properly trained and licensed. 

 

V. Facilities 

 

It is imperative that the seriously injured patient be delivered in a timely manner to the closest appropriate facility.
Each State should ensure that:



 
Both stabilization and definitive care needs of the patient are considered; 

 The determination is free of political considerations and the capabilities of the facilities are clearly understood
by prehospital personnel; 

 Hospital resources capabilities are known in advance, so that appropriate primary and secondary transport decisions
can be made; and 

 Agreements are made between facilities to ensure that patients receive treatment at the closest, most appropriate
facility, including facilities in other states or counties. 

 

VI. Communications 

 

An effective communications system is essential to EMS operations and provides the means by which emergency resources
can be accessed, mobilized, managed, and coordinated. Each State should require a communication system to:



 
Begin with a universal system access number, such as 911; 

 Provide for prioritized dispatch (dispatch-to-ambulance, ambulance-to-ambulance, ambulance-to-hospital,
and hospital-to-hospital communication); 

 Ensure the receiving facility is ready and able to accept the patient; and 

 Provide for dispatcher training and certification standards.



 
Each State should develop a statewide communications plan that defines State government roles in EMS system communications.


 

VII. Trauma Systems 

 

Each State should maintain a fully functional trauma system to provide a high quality, effective patient care system.
States should implement legislation requiring the development of a trauma system, including:



 
Trauma center designation, using American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma guidelines as a minimum; 

 Triage and transfer standards for trauma patients; 

 Data collection and trauma registry definitions for quality assurance;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00039 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Mandatory autopsies to determine preventable deaths; and 

Systems management and quality assurance. 



VIII. Public Information and Education 



Public awareness and education about the EMS system are essential to a high quality system. Each State should implement
a public information and education (PI&E) plan to address: 

 


The components and capabilities of an EMS system; 

The public's role in the system; 

The public's ability to access the system; 

What to do in an emergency (e.g., bystander care training); 

Education on prevention issues (e.g., alcohol or other drugs, occupant protection, speeding, motorcycle and bicycle
safety); and 

The need for dedicated staff and resources for PI&E programming. 



IX. Medical Direction 



Physician involvement in all aspects of the patient care system is critical for effective EMS operations. EMS is a
medical care system in which physicians delegate responsibilities to non-physician providers who manage patient
care outside the traditional confines of the office or hospital. States should require physicians to be involved
in all aspects of the patient care system, including: 

 


Planning and protocols; 

On-line and off-line medical direction and consultation; and 

Audit and evaluation of patient care. 



X. Evaluation 



Each State should implement a comprehensive evaluation program to effectively assess and improve a statewide EMS
system. EMS system managers should: 

 


Evaluate the effectiveness of services provided to victims of medical or trauma-related emergencies; 

Define the impact of patient care on the system; 

Evaluate resource utilization, scope of service, patient outcome, and effectiveness of operational policies,
procedures, and protocols; and 

Develop a data-gathering mechanism that provides for the linkage of data from different data sources through the
use of common data elements.

Highway Safety Program Guideline 
 

No. 14 

Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety 



Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive pedestrian and bicycle
safety program that educates and motivates its citizens to follow safe pedestrian and bicycle practices. A combination
of legislation, regulations, policy, enforcement, public information, education, incentives, and engineering
is necessary to achieve significant, lasting improvements in pedestrian and bicycle crash rates. 

Each State should recognize that its pedestrians and bicyclists_citizens of all ages who are virtually unprotected
from the forces of a crash, face major safety problems and are a valid traffic safety concern. Because of the diverse
nature of these issues, education, enforcement, and engineering are critical components to any strategies devised
to reduce these problems. In formulating policy, the State should promote these specific issues: 

 


The provision of early pedestrian and bicycle safety education and training for preschool children; 

The inclusion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in health and safety education curricula; 

The inclusion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in driver training programs and driver licensing activities; 

The provision of a safe environment for pedestrians and bicyclists through such measures as sidewalks and bicycle
facilities, in the planning and design of all highway projects; 

The use of bicycle helmets as a primary measure to reduce death and injury among bicyclists; 

An awareness of the role of alcohol in adult pedestrian accidents; 

The safeguarding of older citizens from pedestrian accidents; and, 

The establishment and support of Community/Corridor Traffic Safety Programs at the local level. 

 


A comprehensive highway safety system is the most effective means of producing consistent, long-term changes in
knowledge and behavior necessary to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety. The following components create a structure
for identifying problem areas; implementing, measuring, and evaluating the problem areas; and directing the results
back into system improvements. We believe these elements will effectively address the problem.

<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

I. Program Management


Each State should have centralized program planning, initiation, and coordination to promote pedestrian and bicycle
safety program issues as part of a comprehensive highway safety program. Evaluation is also important for determining
progress and ultimate success of pedestrian and bicycle safety programs and for providing those results to revise
existing programs and to develop new programs. The State should have program staff trained in pedestrian and bicyclist
safety so that this program can:



Conduct regular problem identification activities to identify fatality and injury crash trends for pedestrians
and bicyclists and to provide guidance in development of countermeasures,
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to other State agencies and local pedestrian and bicycle
safety programs and projects;
Convene a pedestrian and bicycle safety advisory task force or coalition to organize, integrate with other involved
groups, and generate broad-based support for programs;
Integrate pedestrian and bicycle safety programs into Community/Corridor Traffic Safety Programs, injury prevention
programs, and transportation plans; and
Evaluate the effectiveness of its pedestrian and bicycle safety program.


II. Multi-Disciplinary Involvement


Pedestrian and bicyclist safety goes beyond the confines of any single State or local agency (enforcement or education)
and requires the combined support and coordinated attention of multiple agencies, representing a variety of disciplines,
at the State and local level. At a minimum, the following kinds of agencies should be involved:



Law Enforcement
Education
Public Health
Driver Education and Licensing
Transportation_Engineering, Planning
Public Communications


III. Legislation and Regulations


Each State should enact and enforce pedestrian and bicyclist-related traffic laws and regulations. Specific policies
should be developed to encourage coordination with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and other agencies,
in the development of regulations and laws to promote pedestrian and bicyclist safety.


IV. Law Enforcement


Each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a law enforcement component.
Each State should strongly emphasize the role played by law enforcement personnel in pedestrian and bicyclist safety.
Essential components of that role include:



Developing knowledge of pedestrian and bicyclist crash situations; investigating crashes; and maintaining a report
system that supports problem identification and evaluation activities;
Providing public information and education support;
Providing training to law enforcement personnel in matters of pedestrian and bicycle safety;
Establishing agency policies; and
Coordinating with the supporting education and engineering components.


V. Traffic Engineering


Traffic engineering is a critical element of any crash reduction program. This is true not only for the development
of programs to reduce an existing crash problem, but also to design transportation facilities that provide for the
safe movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and all motor vehicles. Balancing the needs of pedestrians and those of
vehicular traffic (including bicycle) must always be considered. Therefore, each State should ensure that State
and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a traffic engineering component. Traffic engineering efforts
should be coordinated with enforcement and educational efforts. This effort should improve the protection of pedestrians
and bicyclists by application of appropriate traffic engineering measures in design, construction, operation,
and maintenance. These measures should include but not be limited to the following:



Pedestrians signals, signs, and markings
Parking regulations
Sidewalk design
Pedestrian pathways
Bicycle routes and pathways


VI. Public Information and Education


Each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs contain a public information and
education component. This component should address school-based education programs, coordination with traffic
engineering and law enforcement components, public information and awareness campaigns, and other targeted educational
programs such as those for the elderly. These programs should address issues such as:



Being visible in the traffic system (conspicuity)
Use of facilities and accommodations
Law enforcement initiatives
Proper street crossing behavior
The nature and extent of the problem
Driver training with regard to pedestrian and bicycle safety
Rules of the road

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Proper selection and use of bicyclist helmets

Skills training for bicyclists

Proper use of bicycle equipment

Sharing the road





The State should enlist the support of a variety of media, including mass media, to improve public awareness of pedestrian
and bicyclist crash problems and programs directed at preventing them.



VII. Outreach Program



Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in pedestrian and bicycle safety education by involving
individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens
public support for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs.
To encourage community involvement, States should:





Establish a coalition or task force of individuals and organizations to actively promote safe pedestrian and bicycle
safety practices (see Program Management Component);

Create an effective communications network among coalition members to keep members informed; and

Provide materials and resources necessary to promote pedestrian and bicycle safety education programs.



VIII. School-Based Program



Each State should incorporate pedestrian and bicycle safety education into school curricula. Safe walking and bicycle-riding
practices to and from school and school-related events are good health habits and, like other health habits, must
be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The State Department of Education and
the State Highway Safety Agency should:





Ensure that highway safety in general, and pedestrian and bicycle safety in particular, are included in the State-approved
K-12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks;

Establish and enforce written policies requiring safe walking and bicycling practices to and from school, including
use of bicycle helmets on school property; and

Encourage active promotion of safe walking and bicycling practices (including helmet usage) through classroom
and extra-curricular activities.



IX. Driver Education and Licensing



Each State should address pedestrian and bicycle issues in State driver education and licensing programs. Pedestrian
and bicycle safety principles and rules should be included in all driver training and licensing examinations.



X. Evaluation Program



Both evaluation and problem identification require good record keeping by the State and its political subdivisions.
The State should identify the types and frequency of pedestrian and bicyclist crash problems in terms that are relevant
to both the selection and evaluation of appropriate countermeasure programs.

The State should promote effective evaluation of programs by:





Supporting the continuing analysis of police accident reports (PARs) of pedestrian and bicyclist crashes for both
problem identification and program evaluation activities;

Encouraging, supporting, and training localities in impact and process evaluations of local programs;

Conducting and publicizing statewide surveys of public knowledge and attitudes about pedestrian and bicyclist
safety;

Maintaining awareness of trends in pedestrian and bicyclist crashes at the national level and how this might influence
activities statewide;

Evaluating the use of program resources and the effectiveness of existing general public and target population countermeasure
programs.

Ensuring that evaluation results are an integral part of new program planning and problem identification.

Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 15

Police Traffic Services



Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have an efficient and effective police traffic
services (PTS) program to enforce traffic laws, prevent crashes, assist the injured, document specific details
of individual crashes, supervise crash clean-up, and restore safe and orderly movement of traffic. PTS is critical
to the success of most traffic safety countermeasures. Traffic law enforcement plays an important role in deterring
drunk and drugged driving, achieving safety belt use, encouraging compliance with speed laws, and reducing other
unsafe driving actions. Experience has shown that a combination of highly visible enforcement, public information,
education, and training is necessary to achieve a significant and lasting impact in reducing crashes, injuries,
and fatalities. At a minimum, a well-balanced statewide PTS program should be made up of the components detailed below.



I. Program Management



A. Planning and Coordination


Centralized program planning, implementation, and coordination are essential for achieving and sustaining effective
PTS programs. The State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA), in conjunction with State and local law enforcement agencies,
should ensure that these planning and coordinating functions are performed with regard to the State's traffic safety
program, since law enforcement is in most instances a principle component of that program. In carrying out its responsibility
of centralized program planning and coordination, the State should:




Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies;

Coordinate PTS and other traffic safety program areas including Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) safety activities
such as the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program;

Develop and implement a comprehensive plan for all PTS activities, in cooperation with law enforcement leaders;

Generate broad-based support for enforcement programs; and

Integrate PTS into Community/Corridor Traffic Safety Programs.



B. Program Elements



State and local law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the SHSA, should establish PTS as a priority within
their total enforcement program. A PTS program should be built on a foundation of commitment, coordination, planning,
monitoring, and evaluation within the agency's enforcement program. State and local law enforcement agencies should:




Provide the public with a high quality, effective PTS system and have enabling legislation and regulations in place
to implement PTS functions;

Develop and implement a comprehensive enforcement plan for alcohol and drug impaired driving, safety belt use and
child passenger safety laws, speeding, and other hazardous moving violations. The plan should initiate action to
look beyond the issuance of traffic tickets to include enforcement of laws by drivers of all types of vehicles, including
trucks, automobiles, and motorcycles;

Develop a cooperative working relationship with other local, county, and State governmental agencies and community
organizations on traffic safety issues;

Issue and enforce policies on roadside sobriety checkpoints, safety belt use, pursuit driving, crash investigating
and reporting, speed enforcement, and serious traffic violations; and

<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Develop performance measures for PTS that are both qualitative and quantitative.


II. Resource Management


States should encourage law enforcement agencies to develop and maintain a comprehensive resource management plan
to identify and deploy resources needed to effectively support enforcement programs. The resource management plan
should include a specific component on traffic enforcement and safety, integrating traffic enforcement and safety
initiatives into a total agency enforcement program. Law enforcement agencies should:




Conduct periodic assessments of service demands and resources to meet identified needs;
Develop a comprehensive resource management plan, including a specific traffic enforcement and safety component;
Define the plan in terms of budget requirements and services to be provided; and
Develop and implement operational policies for the deployment of resources to address program demands and to meet
agency goals.


III. Traffic Law Enforcement


The enforcement of traffic laws and ordinances is a basic responsibility shared by all police agencies. The primary
objective of this function is to encourage motorists and pedestrians to comply voluntarily with the laws. Administrators
should apply their enforcement resources in ways that ensure the greatest safety impact. Traffic law enforcement
programs should be based on:




Accurate problem identification;
Countermeasures designed to address specific problems;
Enforcement actions applied at appropriate times and places, coupled with a public information effort designed
to make the motoring public aware of the problem and the planned enforcement action; and
A system to document and publicize results.


IV. Public Information and Education


A. Necessity of Public Information and Education


Public awareness and knowledge about traffic enforcement are essential for sustaining increased compliance with
all traffic laws. This requires a well-organized, effectively-managed public information and education program.
The SHSA, in cooperation with law enforcement agencies, should develop a statewide public information and education
campaign that:




Identifies and targets specific audiences;
Addresses enforcement of safety belt use and child passenger safety, drunk and drugged driving, speed, and other
serious traffic laws;
Capitalizes on special events, such as Operation C.A.R.E., Child Passenger Safety Awareness, Buckle Up, America!
and Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness weeks;
Identifies and supports the efforts of traffic safety activist groups to gain increased support of and attention
to traffic safety and enforcement;
Uses national themes, events, and materials; and
Motivates the public to support increased enforcement of traffic laws.




The task of public information can be divided into two interconnected areas: external and internal information.
Both areas, properly administered, will benefit the agency and work in concert to accomplish the goal of establishing
and maintaining a positive police-public relationship.



B. Development of Public Information and Education Functions by Law Enforcement Agencies


External


Educate and remind the public about traffic laws and safe driving behavior;
Disseminate information to the public about agency activities and accomplishments;
Enhance relationships with news media;
Provide safety education and community services;
Provide legislative and judicial information and support; and
Increase the public's understanding of the enforcement agency's role in traffic safety:


Internal


Disseminate information about internal activities to sworn and civilian members of the agency;
Enhance the agency's safety enforcement role and increase employee understanding and support; and
Recognize employee achievements.


V. Data Collection and Analysis


The availability of valid data is critical to any approach intended to increase the level of highway safety. An effective
records program provides fast and accurate information to field personnel who are performing primary traffic functions
and to management for decision-making. Data are usually collected from crash reports, daily officer activity reports
that contain workload and citation information, highway department records (

e.g.,

 traffic volume), citizen complaints, and officer observations. An effective records program should:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Provide information rapidly and accurately; 

Provide routine compilations of data for management use in the decision making process; 

Provide data for operational planning and execution; 

Interface with a variety of data systems, including statewide traffic safety records system; and 

Be accessible to enforcement, planners, and management. 



VI. Training 



Training is one of the most important activities in a law enforcement agency, and it is essential to support the special
requirements of traffic law enforcement and safety. It is essential for operational personnel to be prepared to effectively
perform their duties. Traffic enforcement training can be conducted by the agency, the State Police Officer Standards
and Training (POST) agency, or a commercial trainer. 



A. Purpose and Goals of Training 



Training accomplishes a wide variety of important and necessary goals. Proper training should: 


 


Prepare officers to act decisively and correctly; 
Increase compliance with agency enforcement goals; 
Assist in meeting priorities; 
Improve compliance with established policies; 
Result in greater productivity and effectiveness; 
Foster cooperation and unity of purpose; 
Help offset liability actions; and 
Motivate and enhance officer professionalism. 



B. State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Should 



Periodically assess enforcement activities to determine training needs; 
Require traffic enforcement knowledge and skills in all recruits; 
Provide traffic enforcement in-service training to experienced officers; 

Provide specialized CMV in-service training to traffic enforcement officers; 

Conduct training to implement specialized traffic enforcement skills, techniques, or programs; and 

Train instructors, to increase agency capabilities and to ensure continuity of specialized enforcement skills
and techniques. 



VII. Evaluation 



The SHSA, in conjunction with State and local law enforcement agencies, should develop a comprehensive evaluation
program to measure progress toward established project goals and objectives; effectively plan and implement statewide
and local PTS programs; optimize the allocation of limited resources; measure the impact of traffic enforcement
on reducing crime and traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths; and compare costs of criminal activity to costs of traffic
crashes. Law enforcement managers should: 


 


Include evaluation in initial program planning efforts to ensure that data will be available and that sufficient
resources will be allocated; 

Report results regularly to project and program managers, to police field commanders and officers, and to the public
and private sectors; 

Use results to guide future activities and to assist in justifying resources to legislative bodies; 

Conduct a variety of surveys to assist in determining program effectiveness, such as roadside sobriety surveys,
speed surveys, license checks, belt use surveys, and surveys measuring public knowledge and attitudes about traffic
enforcement programs; 

Evaluate the effectiveness of services provided in support of priority traffic safety areas; and 

Maintain and report traffic data to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Traffic Data Report and other
appropriate repositories, such as the FBI Uniform Crime Report, FHWA's SAFETYNET system, and annual statewide reports.

Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 19
Speed Control


Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have, as part of a comprehensive highway safety
program, an effective speed control program that encourages its citizens to voluntarily comply with speed limits.
The program should stress systematic and rational establishment of speed limits, a law enforcement commitment to
controlling speed on all public roads, a commitment to utilize both traditional methods and state-of-the art equipment
in setting and enforcing speed limits, and a strong public information and education program aimed at increasing
driver compliance with speed limits.


I. Program Management


State and local law enforcement agencies, transportation departments, and the State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA)
should establish speed control as a priority within their total highway safety program. The speed control program
should contain the following elements: program management, procedures for establishing reasonable speed limits,
coordinated enforcement efforts, public information and education, identification and utilization of new technology,
legislative coordination and commitment, training, and evaluation. When planning and developing a program to address
speed control, the issue of speed should be examined in light of the empirical data available, current methods for
setting speed limits, and the current public perception of speed compliance. Added to these elements is the law enforcement
response, including the resources available to enforcement agencies. Only after these components have been examined
and defined can the goals of a speed control program be formulated. In carrying out its responsibility of centralized
program planning and coordination, the State should:



Develop and implement a comprehensive speed control plan in cooperation with law enforcement leaders, traffic engineers,
educators, and leaders of the community;
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies and highway/traffic
agencies;
Generate broad based support for speed control programs through education on the scope and severity of the problem;
and
Integrate speed control into the overall traffic enforcement and engineering program.


II. Enforcement Program


Each State should strongly emphasize speed enforcement as part of its overall traffic enforcement program. The speed
enforcement program should include enforcement strategies and other components of a comprehensive approach to
address the speed issue. The plan should address the following concepts:



Including public information and education components along with vigorous enforcement in State and local anti-speeding
programs;
Collecting data to help in problem identification and evaluation;
Identifying high risk crash locations where speed is a contributing factor in crashes;
Integrating speed control programs into related highway safety activities such as drunk driving prevention, safety
belt and safety programs for young people;
Targeting anti-speeding programs to address specific audiences and situations: young drivers, males, nighttime,
adverse weather and traffic conditions, drunk driving, CMV drivers, school zones, construction and maintenance
work zones, roads and streets with major potential conflicts in traffic and with pedestrians, and so on;
Using speed measuring devices that are both efficient and cost effective, including new speed measurement technology
such as laser speed measuring devices, electronic signing and photo-radar; and
Training officers in the proper use of equipment and educating other members of the criminal justice system, such
as judges and prosecutors, on the principles of devices using new technology.


III. Setting of Speed Limits


States and local governments should undertake comprehensive efforts to identify rational criteria for establishing
speed limits and should include strategies to address the speed issue. These efforts should include:



Identification of criteria used to establish speed limits including the recognition of unique operational characteristics
of CMV's;
Use of state-of-the art technology to collect data to establish speed limits;
Use of variable message speed limit signs to reinforce the appropriate speed limit for prevailing conditions;
Identification of high hazard locations where speeding is a contributing factor;

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A coordinated effort with enforcement agencies, educators, and community leaders to provide information on setting
of speed limits; and

Training traffic and enforcement personnel in the proper techniques for establishing safe and reasonable speed
limits and in the use and deployment of speed monitoring equipment.



IV. Public Information and Education



Focused public information and education campaigns are an essential part of a comprehensive speed control program.
Research shows that compliance with and support for traffic laws can be increased through aggressive, targeted enforcement
combined with an effective public information and education campaign. The SHSA, in cooperation with law enforcement
and transportation agencies, should develop a Statewide public information and education campaign that:




Identifies and targets specific audiences;

Addresses criteria for setting speed limits and enforcement of speed limits particularly for locations experiencing
excessive speed or speed related crashes;

Capitalizes on special events (cooperative, multi-jurisdictional enforcement efforts) such as Operation Co-Flame
and Span I-70 and other special holiday enforcement programs;

Identifies and supports the efforts of traffic safety activist groups to gain increased support of and attention
to traffic safety and speed control;

Use national themes, events, and materials; and

Motivates the public to support speed control by pointing out the public health issues of injury, death, and economic
costs of speed related crashes.



V. Technology



New and updated technology for speed measurement is needed to determine appropriated speed limits for a variety of
conditions and to provide maximum enforcement activity with fewer available resources. Current technology for
measuring speed, such as loop detectors, should be used not only to establish viable speed limits but also to vary speed
limits to conform to existing conditions. State and local governments should only utilize speed measurement equipment
for enforcement that is approved or recognized as reliable and accurate. All law enforcement agencies should use
the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) regional testing laboratories to ensure that equipment
used to measure speeds meets minimum standards. For CMV enforcement purposes, the FHWA will provide MCSAP funding
only for those items of speed control equipment approved by the ICAP or which meet other suitable standards. The SHSA,
in conjunction with law enforcement and traffic/highway agencies, should support programs providing for:




Collection of operational speed data to determine appropriate speed limits and for use of these data in conjunction
with variable message signs;

Police Radar Model Minimum Specifications_NHTSA, in cooperation with the IACP and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), has developed model specifications and testing protocols for police traffic radar. Using
these model specification, IACP in cooperation with radar manufacturers and NHTSA, has established a program to
test radar sets that are available for purchase by law enforcement agencies. Reports of the testing were published
by IACP along with a Consumer Products List which provides law enforcement agencies with the names of radar sets conforming
with the model performance specifications.

Police Radar Testing Program_To ensure that law enforcement agencies can continue to purchase and operate accurate
radar devices, IACP, in cooperation with radar manufacturers and NHTSA, has established an ongoing process of performance
testing for newly developed devices and for maintaining existing equipment. Testing laboratories have been established
at five universities. These laboratories will continue the testing program and will provide services to the law enforcement
community.

Model Performance Specifications and Test Protocols_NIST, Law Enforcement Standards Laboratory, is developing
model minimum performance and testing protocols for automated speed enforcement (ASE) devices, including photo-radar
devices and laser speed measurement devices;

Basic Training Program in VASCAR Speed Measurement_NHTSA has developed a training course for the VASCAR (Visual
Average Speed Computer and Recorder) time-distance speed measurement devices. This course was developed specifically
for use by law enforcement officers; and

Basic Training Program in Radar Speed Measurement_NHTSA has developed a basic training course which teaches the
correct procedures for law enforcement's use of police radar and also the proper instructional techniques for those
teaching the course;



VI. Legislation



To encourage voluntary compliance by drivers, speed limits must be safe, reasonable, and uniform to the greatest
extent possible. Realistic speed limits on roadways (other than those governed by the National Maximum Speed Limit)
should:




Be based upon traffic and engineering investigations; 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Encourage drivers to comply with the posted limits and allow enforcement agencies to better target speeders;

Be accompanied by sanctions, including court and administrative penalties, which are set by law;

Be as consistent as possible with the physical and operational characteristics (actual and perceived) of the roadway;
and

Take into account the needs and safety of all highway users, motorists and non-motorists alike.






Legislative components of an effective speed control program should:






Encourage the highway safety community to develop laws, rules, and regulations that will provide for reasonable
and safe speed limits;

Provide appropriate legislation to allow the establishment of regulatory variable speed limits, such as the provisions
of Chapter 11, Article VIII of the Uniform Vehicle Code;

Provide for public information and education programs to explain how speed limits are established and to convince
drivers that speed limits are realistic, reasonable, and include sanctions; and

Establish sanctions for speeding violations that are reasonable, uniform, and effective as a deterrent.






New devices and technology are available for use in determining appropriate speed limits and in law enforcement actions
to measure the speed of vehicles. Transportation and law enforcement agencies should work closely with the SHSA to
make certain new technologies can be used under existing legislation. As necessary, these groups should work together
in ensuring development and adoption of legislation allowing use of new technologies.



VII. Training



NHTSA fully supports and encourages training for law enforcement officers in the use of speed measurement devices,
model speed enforcement strategies, combined enforcement projects, and planning and implementing public information
and education programs.

In support of law enforcement training NHTSA will continue to publish and widely distribute training programs. These
courses are related to established as well as new and emerging techniques of speed measurement and enforcement. The
training courses are recommended for officers in law enforcement agencies using speed measuring devices. FHWA also
provides training programs on CMV traffic enforcement.

Training for law enforcement officers involved in speed enforcement should include:






Proper use of devices used to measure speed; 

How to use data and analysis to define the speed problem, to target enforcement activities, and to evaluate the results
of countermeasures;

How to relate speed enforcement to public safety;

How to plan and implement a PI&E program on speed enforcement;

Model speed enforcement strategies including examples of combined enforcement programs; and

Escorting and assisting traffic engineers and technicians in deployment and use of speed measuring equipment.






Training for traffic engineers and technicians should include:






Proper use and development of speed measurement equipment; and

Interpreting geometric, operational and environmental data for their impact on roadway safety and user performance.



VIII. Evaluation



The SHSA, in conjunction with State and local law enforcement and transportation agencies should develop a comprehensive
evaluation program to measure progress toward established project goals and objectives. The evaluation should
measure the impact of speed control programs on traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths; and provide information for
revised improved program planning. These agencies should:

Include evaluation in initial program planning efforts to ensure that data will be available and that sufficient
resources will be allocated;


Report results regularly to project and program managers, to police field commanders and officers, to transportation
engineers, and to the public and private sectors.


Use results to verify problem identification, guide future speed control activities, and assist in justifying resources
to legislative bodies;


Conduct a variety of surveys to assist in determining program effectiveness, such as speed surveys and surveys measuring
public knowledge and attitude about speed control programs;


Analyze speed compliance and speed-related crashes in areas with actual hazards to the public;


Evaluate the effectiveness of speed control activities provided in support of other priority traffic safety areas;
and


Maintain and report traffic data to the SHSA, IACP Traffic Data Report and other appropriate repositories, such as
the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, FHWA's SAFETYNET system, and annual statewide reports.



Highway Safety Program Guideline

No. 20

Occupant Protection




Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive occupant protection program
that educates and motivates its citizens to use available motor vehicle occupant protection systems. A combination
of use requirements, enforcement, public information, education, and incentives is necessary to achieve significant,
lasting increases in safety belt usage. Therefore, a well-balanced State occupant protection program should include
the components described below.



I. Program Management




Each State should have centralized program planning, implementation and coordination to achieve and sustain high
rates of safety belt use. Evaluation is also important for determining progress and ultimate success of occupant
protection programs. The State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA) should:







Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to other state agencies and local occupant protection programs
and projects;


Convene an occupant protection advisory task force or coalition to organize and generate broad-based support for
programs;


Integrate occupant protection programs into community/corridor traffic safety programs; and 


Evaluate the effectiveness of its occupant protection program.



II. Legislation, Regulation, and Policy




Each State should enact and enforce safety belt use laws, regulations, and policies to provide clear guidance to the
motoring public concerning motor vehicle occupant protection systems. This legal framework should include:







Legislation requiring all motor vehicle occupants to use the systems provided by the vehicle manufacturer and establish
educational programs to explain their benefits and the correct way to use them;


Legislation requiring children up to 40 pounds (or five years old if weight cannot be determined) to ride in a safety
device certified by the manufacturer to meet all applicable Federal performance standards;


Regulations requiring employees of all levels of government to wear safety belts when traveling on official business;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Official policy requiring that organizations receiving Federal highway safety program grant funds have and enforce
an employee safety belt use policy; and
Encouragement for automobile insurers to offer economic incentives for policy holders to wear safety belts, to secure
small children in child safety seats, and to purchase cars equipped with air bags.


III. Enforcement Program


Each State should have a strong law enforcement program, coupled with public information and education, to increase
safety belt and child safety seat use. Essential components of a law enforcement program include:




Written, enforced belt use policies for law enforcement agencies with sanctions for noncompliance to protect law
enforcement officers from harm and for officers to serve as role models for the motoring public;
Vigorous enforcement of public safety belt use and child safety seat laws, including citations and warnings;
Accurate reporting of occupant protection system information on accident report forms, including use or non-use
of belts, type of belt, and presence of and deployment of air bag;
Public information and education (PI&E) campaigns to inform the public about occupant protection laws and related
enforcement activities;
Routine monitoring of citation rates for non-use of safety belts and child safety seats; and
Certification of an occupant protection training course for both basic and in-service training by the Police Officer
Standards and Training (POST) board.


IV. Public Information and Education Program


As part of each State's public information and education program, the State should enlist the support of a variety
of media, including mass media, to improve public awareness and knowledge about safety belts, air bags, and child
safety seats. To sustain or increase rates of safety belt and child safety seat use, a well-organized, effectively
managed public information program should:




Identify and target specific audiences, (e.g., low-use, high risk motorists) and develop messages appropriate
for these audiences;
Address the enforcement of the State's belt use and child passenger safety laws; the safety benefits of regular, correct
safety belt (both manual and automatic) and child safety seat use; and the additional protection provided by air bags;
Capitalize on special events, such as nationally recognized safety weeks and local enforcement campaigns;
Coordinate different materials and media campaigns where practicable, (e.g., by using a common theme and logo);
Use national themes and materials to the fullest extent possible;
Publicize belt-use surveys and other relevant statistics;
Encourage news media to report belt use and non-use in motor vehicle crashes;
Involve media representatives in planning and disseminating public information campaigns;
Encourage private sector groups to incorporate belt-use messages into their media campaigns;
Take advantage of all media outlets: television, radio, print, signs, billboards, theaters, sports events, health
fairs; and
Evaluate all media campaign efforts.

V. Health/Medical Program 



Each State should integrate occupant protection into health programs. The failure of drivers and passengers to use
occupant protection systems is a major health problem that must be recognized by the health care community. The SHSA
and the State Health Department should collaborate in developing programs that: 


 


Integrate occupant protection into professional health training curricula and comprehensive public health planning;


Promote occupant protection systems as a health promotion/disease prevention measure; 

Require public health and medical personnel to use available motor vehicle occupant protection systems when on the
job; 

Provide technical assistance and education about the importance of motor vehicle occupant protection to primary
caregivers, (e.g., doctors, nurses, clinic staff); 

Include questions about safety belt use in health risk appraisals; 

Utilize health care providers as visible public spokespersons for belt use and child safety seat use; 

Provide information about availability of child safety seats through maternity hospitals and other pre-natal and
natal care centers (see Program Component VI: Child Passenger Safety Program); and 

Collect, analyze, and publicize data on additional injuries and medical expenses resulting from non-use of occupant
protection devices. 



VI. Child Passenger Safety Program 



Each State should vigorously promote the use of child safety seats. States should require every child up to 40 pounds
to ride correctly secured in a child safety seat that meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (see Program Component
II: Legislation, Regulation, and Policy). State and community child passenger safety programs that will help to
achieve that objective should be established to: 



Educate parents, pediatricians, hospitals, law enforcement, EMS and the general public about the safety risks to
small children, the benefits of child safety seats, and their responsibilities for compliance with child passenger
safety laws; 

Encourage child safety seat retailers and auto dealers to provide information about child seat and vehicle compatibility,
as well as correct use; 

Require safe child transportation policies for certification of pre-school and day care providers; 

Require hospitals to ensure that newborn and other small children are correctly secured in an approved child safety
seat or safety belt upon discharge; 

Make child safety seats available at affordable cost to low-income families; and 

Encourage local law enforcement to vigorously enforce child passenger safety laws, including safety belt use laws
as they apply to children. 



VII. School-Based Program 



Each State should incorporate occupant protection education in school curricula. Buckling up is a good health habit
and, like other health habits, must be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The
State Department of Education and the State Highway Safety Agency should: 


 


Ensure that highway safety in general, and occupant protection in particular, are included in the State-approved
K-12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks; 

Establish and enforce written policies requiring that school employees operating a motor vehicle on the job use safety
belts; and 

Encourage active promotion of regular safety belt use through classroom and extra-curricular activities as well
as in the school-based health clinics. 



VIII. Worksite Program 



Each State should encourage all employers to require safety belt use on the job as a condition of employment. The Federal
government has already taken that step for its employees. Private sector employers should follow the lead of Federal
and State government employers and comply with all applicable FHWA Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or Occupational
Health and Safety (OSHA) regulations requiring private business employees to use safety belts on the job. All employers
should: 


 


Establish and enforce a safety belt use policy with sanctions; and 

Conduct occupant protection education programs for employees on their belt use policies and the safety benefits
of motor vehicle occupant protection. 



IX. Outreach Program 



Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in occupant protection education by involving individuals
and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens public support
for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs. To encourage
community involvement, States should:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Establish a coalition or task force of individuals and organizations to actively promote use of occupant protection
systems;
Create an effective communications network among coalition members to keep members informed; and
Provide materials and resources necessary to conduct occupant protection education programs, especially directed
toward young people, in local settings.


X. Evaluation Program


Each State should conduct several different types of evaluation to effectively measure progress and to plan and implement
new program strategies. Program management should:



Conduct and publicize at least one statewide observational survey of safety belt and child safety seat use annually,
making every effort to ensure that it meets applicable federal guidelines;
Maintain trend data on child safety seat and belt use in fatal crashes;
Identify target populations through observational surveys and crash statistics;
Conduct and publicize statewide surveys of public knowledge and attitudes about occupant protection laws and systems;
Obtain monthly or quarterly data from law enforcement agencies on the number of safety belt and child passenger safety
citations and convictions;
Evaluate the use of program resources and the effectiveness of existing general public and target population education
programs;
Obtain data on morbidity as well as the estimated cost of crashes in regards to safety belt usage and non-usage; and
Ensure that evaluation results are an integral part of new program planning and problem identification.


Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 21
Roadway Safety


Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive roadway safety program
that is directed toward reducing the number and severity of traffic crashes.


I. Program Management


The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides administrative oversight for the Roadway Safety portion of
the section 402 highway safety program in close coordination with the State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA) and the State
Highway Agency (SHA). Although section 402 dollars cannot be utilized for highway construction, maintenance or
design activities, they can be used to develop and implement systems and procedures for carrying out safety construction
and operational improvements. These funds can also be used to augment Federal-aid highway programs, such as the Hazard
Elimination Program (Section 152) and the Rail-Highway Crossings Programs (Section 130), as well as other safety
construction activities.
An effective Roadway Safety program is based on sound analyses of roadway-related crash information and applies
engineering principles in identifying highway design or operational improvements that will address the crash problem.
The SHSA should:



Assign program staff to work directly with the FHWA division safety engineer on roadway-related safety programs.
Work in close harmony with the SHA, particularly with SHA staff who are responsible for traffic engineering, pedestrian
and bicycle programs, CMV safety, rail-highway crossing safety issues, work zone safety, design and operational
improvements, and hazardous roadway locations.
Foster an ongoing dialogue among all disciplines with a vested interest in highway safety, including engineers,
enforcement personnel, traffic safety specialists, driver licensing administrators, CMV safety specialists,
and data specialists.
Promote a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing highway safety issues which focuses on comprehensive solutions
to identified problems. An example is assisting in the coordination and the implementation of Community/Corridor
Traffic Safety Programs, and MCSAP, where appropriate.
Become familiar with the various highway-safety related categories of Federal-aid highway funds_in addition to
section 402_in order to maximize the safety benefits of the entire program.
Become familiar with the State's traffic records system and play a role in the system's ongoing operation, maintenance
and enhancement.
Assist community leaders in managing and/or coordinating programs designed to address roadway safety issues and
concerns which fall under the jurisdiction of local communities.
Become familiar with MCSAP and coordinate MCSAP and section 402 program activities.


II. Related Highway Safety Program Guidelines


Roadway Safety applies to highway safety activities related to the roadway environment and includes activities
which are described in the following Highway Safety Program Guidelines:

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was signed into law December 18, 1991. Section
2002(a) of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six key
areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to congress describing the reasons for not prioritizing
these programs. The six program areas involve: Speed control, Use of occupant protection devices, Driving while
impaired, Motorcycle safety, School Bus Safety, and Police Traffic Services. The existing National Priority Program
Areas address four of the six areas identified by the Act, but do not include Speed Control or School Bus Safety. The
agencies have reviewed existing data and statistics regarding deaths and injuries attributable to these two areas
and have considered the availability of existing countermeasures related to speed control and school bus safety,
and tentatively propose to include Speed Control as a Priority Program Area, but have tentatively concluded that
School Bus Safety does not warrant being included as a Priority Program. Interested persons are invited to submit
comments on this proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background





The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (the 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety Act
of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs
to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs.


Eighteen such standards were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA
is responsible for developing and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver, while
FHWA has similar responsibilities in program areas involving the roadway.

Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 Highway
Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for noncompliance.
Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the
Secretary would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform
standard. As a result, the standards became more like guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program then
shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem identification, and countermeasure development and evaluation,
using the standards as a framework for the State programs.

In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Public Law 97-35, revising the section
402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety
programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities.

On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority Program Areas
which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included
one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas:
Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic
Records.

The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority Program Areas would be eligible for Federal funding
under an expedited procedure under the 402 program (23 CFR 1205.4.). It also established a mechanism by which other,
non-priority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. (23 CFR 1205.5 (a) and (b).)


Periodic Review and Determination of Priority Programs



On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub.
L. 100-17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various
programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review
procedure was believed to be the best method of ensuring the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing
circumstances and traffic safety needs, and for ensuring that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective
programs.

The legislation also provided that the terms ``standard'' and ``standards'' within 23 CFR Part 1204 be replaced with
the words ``guideline'' and ``guidelines.'' The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section
402 to the current implementation of the programs.

Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective
in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988, (53 FR 1255) the agencies determined
that the National Priority Program Areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly,
Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in
1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should also be included.

On May 3, 1991, NHTSA/FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as one
of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and resulted in the addition
of that area as one of the National Priority Program Areas eligible for the expedited funding process.

As a result of these prior rulemaking actions, the National Priority Program Areas currently include the following:

1. Alcohol and Other Drug Countermeasures

2. Police Traffic Services

3. Occupant Protection

4. Traffic Records

5. Emergency Medical Services

6. Motorcycle Safety

7. Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety and

8. Roadway Safety

The agencies apply three criteria to determine whether a program area should be identified as a National Priority
Program under 23 CFR Part 1205:

 Whether the problem is of national concern; 

 Whether effective countermeasures have been developed in this area which address this concern; and

 Whether State programs in the area appear to be among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and
fatalities as compared to other traffic safety program areas.

In determining whether a problem is of national concern, the agencies consider the relative magnitude of the problem.

Today's notice is being issued to solicit comments on a proposal of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to expand this list of National Priority Program Areas to include
Speed Control, and to obtain comments on the agencies' preliminary determination that School Bus Safety should not
be added as a National Priority Program Area at this time. The agencies have considered relevant data, statistics,
and other available information in reaching this conclusion and now seek public comments from interested parties
on these tentative determinations. The following discussion highlights the key issues and factors considered by
the agencies in making these preliminary determinations. (In a separate notice published elsewhere in this issue
of the 

Federal Register

, the agencies are requesting comments on revisions and amendments to Highway Safety Program Guidelines relating
to several program areas including Speed Control.)



Speed Control as a National Priority Area



Is Speeding a Problem of National Concern?



The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA and FHWA. Over the course of the agencies'
history, we have funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Speeding is defined as
not only exceeding the posted speed limit, but also driving too fast for conditions. Some common conclusions from
these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling
in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists.



Speeding is Becoming More Prevalent



While many speed/traffic surveys are taken, reliable data on travel speed are relatively limited, and often difficult
to compare. The most reliable speed data are those reported by the States for National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL) roadways
posted at 55 mph. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publishes an annual report containing a compendium of
speed monitoring data submitted by each State. Analyses of recent speed monitoring data by the FHWA indicate that
speeds at which many motorists travel have increased in recent years.

There are less comprehensive data collected for roadways which have speed limits of less than 55 mph, including the
many rural highways and urban/suburban streets and roads which are posted at lower speeds for reasons of road design,
traffic patterns, volume, and safety. These non-NMSL roads account for 74 percent of the total paved road mileage
in the U.S. and for approximately 47 percent of all traffic deaths. The lack of empirical data makes it difficult to
identify the extent of the speeding problem on these non-NMSL roads. A recent FHWA study of these roads entitled 

Assessment of Current Speed Zoning Criteria 

found that: (1) On average, seven out of ten motorists exceeded posted limits; (2) average speeds ran approximately
two to six mph above posted limits; and (3) prevailing 85th percentile speeds ran approximately eight to twelve mph
above posted limits. The observations of law enforcement executives and other highway safety officials confirm
that speeds are increasing on these roads.

Speed surveys on the Interstate highways also show that average speeds and the percent of traffic travelling at high
speeds have also increased on these roads. For example, the percent of vehicles exceeding 65 mph (on roadways with
a 65 mph speed limit) were estimated to be 47 percent in 1990 (up from 37% in 1988) while those exceeding 70 mph accounted
for approximately 19 percent (up from approximately 16 percent in 1988).

After Congress amended the NMSL in 1987 to permit 20 States to increase the speed limit to 65 mph on rural interstates
as a demonstration program, NHTSA issued a detailed report on the effects of the increase. This interim report indicated
that average speeds increased somewhat on rural interstates. The latest NMSL research, contained in the agency's


Report to Congress on the Effects of the 65 mph Speed Limit through 1990 

(NHTSA, May 1992), shows the average travel speed on rural 65 mph Interstates in 1990 was 65 mph (up from 63 mph in 1988);
the 85th percentile speed was 71 mph (up from 69 mph in 1988); and fatalities on rural interstates were an estimated
30 percent higher in 1990 than the number expected, based on historical trends, had the speed limit remained at 55 mph.
A series of focus group discussions held by NHTSA with the general public suggest that most drivers recognize speeding
as a violation of the law, but few regard the violation as a serious offense.

These studies all suggest that the motoring public does not view speeding per se as an immediate risk to their personal
safety.

Excessive Speed Causes Crashes



Speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated with crashes. Studies identify correlations between
speeding and other factors including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists, and nighttime
driving. Speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all police-reported crashes and
in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System, 1991). It is estimated
that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,277 moderate to critical injuries occurred in speed-related crashes. The
economic cost of all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels) was over $18 billion.

Excessive speed has long been recognized as one of the prime factors contributing to motor vehicle crashes. This contribution
has several sources:

 Drivers have less time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle
travels during the time it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger;

 Speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt a vehicle; and
 Speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways, or objects in the roadway.
A major speed-related factor which has been linked to crash involvement is speed variance: The difference in speed
among vehicles in the traffic stream. Speed variance is calculated in terms of standard deviation from the mean speed.
For example, ten vehicles all traveling at 55 mph on the same highway would have a mean speed of 55 mph and a standard deviation
of zero, whereas five vehicles traveling at 65 mph and five vehicles traveling at 45 mph would have a mean speed of 55
mph but a standard deviation of 10.5.

Research studies such as those in 55: 

A Decade of Experience

 (Transportation Research Board, 1984) have shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance
is greater. As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently. This leads to more frequent
lane changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower vehicles. Data from the 

National Crash Severity Study

 (1979) show that vehicles travelling 20 mph above the average speed experience a crash risk 11 times greater than those
travelling at the average speed. This data implies that crashes can be reduced by controlling speed variance. Controlling
speed variance is especially critical on roadways with speed limits less than 65 mph, where conflicting actions and
reactions typically cause much larger variations in speed.


Speed Increases the Severity of Crashes

The trend toward increased speeds is cause for concern because of the reduced margin for error and the increase in severity
for those vehicles involved in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy
of the impact delivered in a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen. The chance of death or serious
injury increases dramatically for every 10 mph increase in vehicle speed for the crash involved vehicle. The 

National Crash Severity Study

 (NHTSA, 1979) revealed that a driver crashing with a 50 mph change in velocity is twice as likely to be killed as one crashing
with a 40 mph change in velocity. In short, crashes at higher speeds increase the potential for more deaths and disabling
injuries.


Have Effective Speed Control Countermeasures Been Developed?

Enforcement personnel have several effective countermeasures available for speed control which have been developed
by new technology. Traditional methods of speed control once involved the use of stopwatches and pneumatic hoses
stretched across the roadway to determine vehicle speeds. Later developments included the introduction of radar
and VASCAR which more precisely measured vehicle speeds and reduced the degree of possible operator error. Currently
laser speed measuring devices with an extremely high degree of accuracy are becoming available to the law enforcement
community.NHTSA has taken an active role in identifying and evaluating new law enforcement technology. After evaluating
new devices, NHTSA has established demonstration programs to introduce those devices into the law enforcement community
to further advance speed control efforts. These demonstration programs have included enforcing speed limits using
radar, VASCAR, laser speed measuring devices, aerial speed measurement, photo radar, electronic signing and saturation
patrols.NHTSA studies show that one of the best methods to obtain compliance with speed limits is to combine an aggressive
enforcement campaign with a vigorous public information and education effort. Public service announcements (PSA)
regarding speed are regularly developed and distributed by NHTSA. Furthermore, other effective countermeasures,
such as saturation patrols and multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional enforcement efforts, have been developed and
furnished to the law enforcement community. These programs can easily become a part of an agency's traffic enforcement
program.Several highway design and traffic control measures have also demonstrated effectiveness for speed control.
Freeway design, culminating in the Interstate System, eliminated all at-grade intersections thus providing for
free flow traffic. This singular design characteristic resulted in significant reduction in speed variance and
the promotion of uniform operating speed. Speed variances on the Interstate System have traditionally been in the
range of 6-9 miles per hour while speed variances on non-freeway facilities can be as great as 20 miles per hour.In
addition, the need to control speed for varying conditions has led to the development of variable message speed signs.
These devices, first used on the New Jersey Turnpike in the late 1960's have had widespread implementation on all types
of facilities and warn drivers of impeding congestion, weather conditions, construction, and incidents which required
reduction in operating speed. Real time regulatory variable speed limits are now being tested in the State of Washington.

The agencies believe that Federal, State, and local governments should have balanced programs that use the most cost-effective
strategies for decreasing crash risks from speeding. This includes: (1) Targeting enforcement where speeding has
a significant impact on public safety and accompanying it with public information and education; (2) using a variety
of techniques and technologies for speed control; (3) understanding who speeds, where, and why; and (4) ensuring
that posted speed limits are appropriate for conditions. These efforts can be further enhanced through the development
of comprehensive speed control programs which include establishment of appropriate criteria for the setting and
posting of speed limits, focused attention upon roadway construction and condition, posting of appropriate roadway
signs, elimination of hazards adjacent to the roadway, and establishment of research projects to further study the
characteristics and consequences of speeding in order to develop improved countermeasures and guidelines.

NHTSA submitted a report to Congress in 1991 entitled 

Speed Enforcement Program Plan

 to identify methods to address the speeding problem. The plan relies heavily upon programs and projects that have
proven to be most effective and outlines speed control initiatives that have proven successful. The plan also stresses
a law enforcement commitment to controlling speed on all public roads, using state-of-the-art equipment, with a
strong emphasis on public information and education designed to increase driver compliance with speed limits.



Are State Speed Control Programs Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?



The State programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control countermeasures are extremely
effective in reducing deaths and injuries. For example, the New York State Police 55 mph enforcement project was successful
in decreasing the number of drivers traveling at the highest rates of speed (often considered to be ``professional
speeders''). While average speed declined slightly from 61.6 to 61.3 mph, the percent of drivers exceeding 70 mph
declined from 6.9% to 5.1%. The percent exceeding 65 mph declined from 24.1% to 21.4%, and the percent exceeding 60
mph declined from 56.4% to 55.7%. This success is believed to have ultimately led to reductions in the number of fatal
crashes, fatalities and serious injuries suffered in New York.

In South Carolina, it is believed that the state's rural initiative involving sheriffs contributed to a significant
reduction in crashes, injuries, and fatalities in 1991 as compared to 1989. During that period, the state experienced
12,472 fewer crashes, 2,331 fewer injuries and 106 fewer fatalities. South Carolina's PSA campaign also received
widespread recognition from across the State and is believed to have contributed to the reduction of crashes during
the time the campaign was operational.

During the first year of the St. Louis enforcement operation, ending September 1991, the average speed dropped from
62 mph to 61 mph on the 55 mph roadways in the metro area, as a result of the police agencies issuing 3,698 citations and
5,600 warnings for speeding during the Operation Gateway period. This cooperative program is continuing and is expected
to result in further speed decreases on the involved roadways in the metro St. Louis area.

Similarly, the speed control efforts targeting commercial vehicles appear to be effective, with early results from
the 1987 Commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement project in California indicating that all crashes where commercial
vehicles were at fault decreased by 3.5% (from 810 in 1986 to 782 in 1987) in the five test sites throughout the State.
Further, the number of accidents caused by commercial vehicles which resulted in injuries in these test sites also
declined by 11.2% (from 259 in 1986 to 230 in 1987). Accompanying that reduction was a corresponding decrease in the
societal cost of injuries and fatalities resulting from such crashes.



Determination Regarding Speed Control



The agencies believe it is clear that excessive speed does represent a significant traffic safety problem. Speeding
is a problem throughout the country in all regions and on all types of roads. Numerous countermeasures have been developed
that have proven to be most effective in addressing this problem.

The agencies, therefore, tentatively conclude that Speed Control meets all requisite criteria and propose to include
it as a National Priority Program Area.



School Bus Safety as a National Priority Area



Is School Bus Safety a Problem of National Concern?



The safety of children in school buses has been a primary concern of parents and school systems ever since buses began
to be used to transport children. That concern has helped develop school buses into the safest form of transportation
in the country. According to the National Safety Council's ``Accident Facts'' (1991), during the 1989-90 school
year, it is estimated that 380,000 buses were used to transport 22 million pupils approximately 3.8 billion miles
(21 million miles per school day). The National Safety Council statistics also indicate fatality rates per hundred
million passenger miles in 1989 were 1.12 for passenger cars and 0.04 for school buses. 

The relative safety of school buses is evident from the following table, which shows all vehicle occupant fatalities.
Included are the number of preschool (0-4) and school-age children (5-18) who were fatally injured in
motor vehicle crashes in 1990, and the type of vehicle in which they were riding at the time.

School bus-related crashes result in fatalities not only to occupants of school buses and other vehicles, but also
to pedestrians. Pedestrians accounted for 28 percent of the total school bus-related fatalities from 1986 through
1990. In crashes involving school buses during that period, an average of 38 pedestrians were fatally injured each
year, with 72 percent being struck by the bus, while the remaining 28 percent were struck by another vehicle. Approximately
75 percent of pedestrian fatalities involving school buses from 1986-1990 were of school age (less than 20 years
of age); of these, approximately 69 percent were struck by the bus.

The National Safety Council reports that during the 1989-1990 school year, most of these pedestrian fatalities
involved individuals who were either approaching or leaving a loading zone and that more than half of the pupil pedestrian
victims were struck by the school bus which they were boarding or exiting. The National Academy of Science's Special
Report No. 222, ``School Bus Safety,'' (1989) states that injuries received at bus stops tend to be more severe than
injuries received on board a bus. The report also states that, as pedestrians, children between the ages of five and
six are particularly vulnerable and account for more than one-half of the young pedestrians fatally injured by school
buses.

School bus crashes have a much different effect on the population as a whole than automobile crashes. When a child is
fatally injured in a school bus crash there is a greater sense of loss and a greater sense of tragedy. For this reason,
school bus fatalities and crashes often receive a high degree of public attention and draw an immediate and passionate
response from the community. However, the number of fatalities in school bus crashes is small, particularly when
considering exposure and when compared to the number of fatalities related to other priority programs.


In 1991, passenger cars were involved in 82.8 percent of all traffic crashes and 67.9 percent of all fatal crashes;
whereas school buses were involved in only 0.4 percent of all traffic crashes and in 0.3 percent of all fatal crashes.
These data demonstrate that the safety problem related to school buses is not great when compared to that of other types
of vehicles.



Have Effective School Bus Safety Measures Been Developed?



Although statistics demonstrate that school buses already provide a remarkably safe form of transportation, the
agency has taken steps to further improve school bus safety. At the request of Congress, the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) studied school bus safety to determine which safety measures would be ``most effective'' in protecting school
children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses. (See, ``Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation
Assistance Act of 1987,'' Pub. L. 100-17, 204(a), 101 Stat. 219, April 2, 1987.) In May 1989, the National Research
Council (NRC), an agency of the NAS, issued a report entitled ``Improving School Bus Safety,'' Special Report No.
222. The report confirmed the high level of safety provided by the Nation's school bus fleet, and also suggested measures
that could further improve the safety of school buses.

In accordance with the 1987 law, NHTSA reviewed the findings of the NAS report and, on July 13, 1989, published a notice
in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 29629), in which the agency determined which safety measures would be most effective in protecting the safety
of school children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses.

NHTSA found replacing pre-1977 school buses to be a ``most effective'' measure, because of the higher level of crashworthiness
provided by NHTSA's 1977 school bus standards, the improved mirror systems, and other crash avoidance measures typically
provided on newer school buses. The agency also found prohibiting standees on school buses to be a ``most effective''
measure. In addition, NHTSA found a number of measures which address the safety of children while boarding or exiting
the bus to be ``most effective.'' They include equipping new buses with stop signal arms and cross-view mirrors and
implementing student crossing, pedestrian safety education and school bus driver training programs. NHTSA also
identified a number of measures as ``effective.''

The agency took several steps to encourage the adoption of these ``effective'' and ``most effective'' measures.
In FY's 1990 and 1991, NHTSA set aside, in accordance with provisions in the Highway Safety Act of 1987 (Title II, Pub.
L. 100-17), funds to assist the States in implementing these school bus safety measures. The funds were used
by States on measures that had been designated by NHTSA to be either ``effective'' or ``most effective'' in improving
school bus safety.

In addition, NHTSA conducted a number of rulemaking actions to upgrade the agency's school bus safety standards.
For example, NHTSA issued a final rule on May 3, 1991, requiring new school buses manufactured after September 1, 1992,
to be equipped with a stop signal arm (56 FR 20363); a final rule on November 2, 1992, revising the minimum requirements
for school bus emergency exits and improving access to school bus emergency doors (57 FR 49413); and a final rule on
December 2, 1992, requiring that school buses enable drivers to see, either directly or through mirrors, certain
specified areas in front of and along both sides of the buses (57 FR 57000).

Further, as stated previously, in a final rule dated October 4, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA expanded the list of National Priority
programs areas, which are eligible for section 402 funding using an expedited process, to include Pedestrian and
Bicycle Safety. The agencies considered the problem of school bus-related pedestrian fatalities when they decided
to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety to the list of priority programs, and specifically stated, in the final rule,
that programs designed to prevent these fatalities are within the scope of this new priority program.

Are These School Bus Safety Measures Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?



As stated previously, school buses already provide the safest form of transportation in our country. Since the number
of fatalities that are school bus-related is already so small, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of the actions
that have been taken. The agencies believe, however, that these measures are the ones most likely to reduce or eliminate
fatal and serious injuries. 



Determination Regarding School Bus Safety



Based upon the agencies' review of the available material regarding the scope of the problem, including FHWA studies
regarding bus driver training and driver fatigue, we have determined that significant attention has been devoted
to school bus safety, and steps have been taken to improve the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation.


In view of the successful measures already taken, the agencies do not view school bus transportation as a problem nearly
as significant as other highway safety program areas. 

Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the section 402 program to address school bus and other highway
safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety
benefits. In addition, the recent designation of Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as a National Priority program area
has facilitated the States' ability to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur while
children are boarding or existing, not riding the bus. 

The agencies believe that the establishment of School Bus Safety as a priority area could result in States shifting
402 funds away from other priority programs, and that the expenditure of an increased level of 402 funds in this manner
would not significantly affect the overall safety of school buses. 

Therefore, the agencies tentatively conclude that School Bus Safety should not be included as a National Priority
program at this time. The agencies wish to stress that this tentative decision should not be construed to imply that
the current resources focused upon School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected. NHTSA and FHWA believe that
all existing efforts in this area should be continued to maintain the impressive safety record associated with school
bus transportation. The agencies hereby request data, statistics, and other substantive information relevant
to this determination. 



Comments



Those wishing to comment on this document should limit comments to the safety aspects of these two programs, and submit
data or statistics which demonstrate the extent of the nation's highway safety problem which is attributable to either
Speeding or School Bus Safety, along with any discussion of countermeasures which are or could be effective in reducing
the number of deaths and injuries in either of these two areas. In determining whether these programs should be identified
as National Priority Programs, the agencies will determine whether the problem is of national concern; whether effective
countermeasures have been developed to address the concern; and whether State programs appear to be among the most
effective as compared to other traffic safety program areas. 

In order to expedite the submission of comments, simultaneous with issuance of this notice, copies of this notice
will be mailed to all Governors and Governors' Representatives for Highway Safety. 

Comments should not exceed 15 pages in length. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. Necessary
attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended
to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. 

All comments received before the closing date indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examination
in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the
closing date will also be considered. However, the rulemaking action may proceed at any time after that date. The agencies
will continue to file relevant material in the docket as it becomes available after the closing date, and it is recommended
that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. 

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the docket should enclose, in the envelope
with their comments, a pre-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will
return the postcard by mail.



Economic and Other Effects



The agencies have considered the impacts that would be associated with this proposed action, and determined that
it is significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures since
it raises policy issues concerning the setting of priority programs. This rulemaking document was reviewed under
E.O. 12866. The rulemaking would not affect the level of funding available in the highway safety program, or otherwise
have a significant economic impact. The agency has prepared a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation which is available
in the docket.

Small Entity Impact



In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agencies have evaluated the effects of this action on small
entities. Based on the evaluation, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. States will be recipients of any funds awarded under the regulation and, accordingly, the
preparation of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is unnecessary.



Environmental Impacts



The agencies have also analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act. The agencies
have determined that this action would not have any effect on the human environment.



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
it has been determined that it has no federalism implication that warrants the preparation of a federalism assessment.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The requirement relating to this proposal, that each State must submit a highway safety plan to receive section 402
grant funds, is considered to be an information collection requirement, as that term is defined by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. Accordingly, these requirements have been submitted to and approved by OMB, pursuant
to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). These requirements have been approved through 11/30/95; OMB No. 2127-0501. This NPRM would establish no
new information collection requirement, as that term is defined by the OMB in 5 CFR part 1320.

Office of the Secretary, Department of the Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; reopening of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document reopens and extends the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking published on August 12,
1993 (58 FR 42918). This action is being taken because the Department was unable to publish the final rule before the
end of Fiscal Year 1993 and the Buy American requirements were again included in the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994. Pursuant
to these statutory provisions, the Department proposes to extend the requirements to Fiscal Year 1994, under the
same terms as set forth in the August 12, 1993 document.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 5, 1992, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (``the
Act'') was signed into law. Section 319 of the Act was entitled ``Buy American Requirements.'' The section applied
to funds appropriated or transferred pursuant to the Act for the purchase of any equipment or product that may have
been authorized to be purchased with financial assistance.


Section 319(b)(2) required that in providing financial assistance under the Act, the Secretary shall provide to
each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the Buy American requirement. No other specific Congressional
guidance was given regarding the implementation of this requirement.
The Department proposed to revise 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart E to implement these requirements. Since no specific
guidance was provided by Congress, the Department decided to base its implementation upon similar rules in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation.
Public Law 103-138, the ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994,'' and
Public Law 103-126, the ``Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994,'' extend the Buy American
requirements to awards of financial assistance under the Department's general appropriation for Fiscal Year 1994,
as well as to similar awards by the Bureau of Reclamation. Because the statutes change no other portions of the Buy American
requirements, and because the Department was unable to issue a final rule prior to the enactment of the two statutes,
the Department now proposes to issue a final rule based on the proposed rule published on August 12, 1993. No other significant
changes are proposed.
Only one public comment was received in response to the publication of the proposed rule. This action will allow for
the receipt of more comments to be considered prior to the publication of the final rule.

General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation; Small Business Subcontracting Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice invites written comments on a proposed revision which expresses GSA's expectation that offerors under
GSA procurements, in submitting required subcontracting plans, will do more than merely restate minimum plan requirements
described at FAR 52.219-9. GSA also expects subcontracting plans to demonstrate aggressiveness, creativity,
and innovation in involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in subcontracting
opportunities and an understanding of the requirement that these concerns be afforded the maximum practicable opportunity
to perform as subcontractors in the offeror's procurements. In negotiated solicitations, the subcontracting plan
will be negotiated with price and any technical and management proposal required by the solicitation. In sealed bid
solicitations, target goals may be stated by GSA in the solicitation. GSA understands, however, that offerors' subcontracting
circumstances may vary greatly. The proposed revision also deletes various sections because they concern nonregulatory
material.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Executive Order 12866



This rule was not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review because the rule is not a significant
regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and, therefore, was not required
to be submitted.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the GSA certifies that the proposed rule will not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,
since the revised subcontracting plan requirements in the proposed regulation will not apply to small business concerns.
Accordingly, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The retitled provision at 552.219-73 contains an information collection requirement that is subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and it has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection may be submitted
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503.
The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.219-73 Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of
Subcontracting Plans.'' The provision requires all offerors, other than small business concerns, responding to
a negotiated solicitation to submit a subcontracting plan with their respective offers so that a plan can be negotiated
concurrently with other parts of the proposal. The respondents are potential GSA contractors. The contracting officer
will use the information to evaluate whether GSA's expectation that subcontracting opportunities exist for small,
small disadvantaged and women-owned small business is reasonable under the circumstances; negotiate goals consistent
with statutory requirements and acquisition objectives; and expedite the award process. The estimated annual burden
for this additional collection is 14,690 hours. This is based on an estimated burden per response of 11.3 hours, a proposed
frequency of one response per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents of 1,300.



List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 519 and 552

The requirement at FAR 19.702(a)(1) for submission of a subcontracting plan by only the apparently successful offeror
does not apply to GSA negotiated solicitations when the contract is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction).
Except for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures and those offering minimal
subcontracting opportunities, negotiated solicitations shall require submission with the initial offer of a subcontracting
plan in the format described in FAR 52.219-9 by all offerors that are not small business concerns. Where price
is the basis for award, such as multiple award schedule contracts, the plan will be evaluated and negotiated along
with price. In solicitations requiring technical and management proposals, the subcontracting plan will be included
as an evaluation factor or subfactor and negotiated concurrently with the technical, management, and price proposals.

519.708 

Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.



(a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.219-72, Notice to Offerors of Subcontracting
Plan Requirements, on the cover page of the solicitation if the contract amount is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000
for construction) except for:

(1) Acquisitions set aside for small business; 

(2) Solicitations for personal services;

(3) Solicitations for work to be performed outside any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and 

(4) Acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures.

(b) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.219-73, Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation
of Subcontracting Plans, in negotiated solicitations if the contract amount is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000
for construction) except for:

(1) Acquisitions set aside for small business;

(2) Solicitations for personal services; 

(3) Solicitations for work to be performed outside any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;

(4) Acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures; and

(5) Solicitations where, in the judgment of the contracting officer, subcontracting opportunities are minimal.

(c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.219-74, Goals for Subcontracting Plan, in sealed
bid solicitations if the contract amount is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) except for:

(1) Acquisitions set aside for small business;

(2) Solicitations for personal services;

(3) Solicitations for work to be performed outside any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.



The basic provision should be used when the contracting officer is able to realistically establish target goals.
Alternate I should be used when the contracting officer cannot establish realistic target goals.

552.219-72 

Notice to offerors of subcontracting plan requirements.



As prescribed in 519.708(a), insert the following provision:



Notice to Offerors of Subcontracting Plan Requirements (XXX 1993)



The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided
to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this
contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to
FAR 52.219-9 to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before
being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that
its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned
small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.



(End of Provision)




8. Section 552.219-73 is revised to read as follows:



552.219-73

Preparation, submission, and negotiation of subcontracting plans.



As prescribed in 519.708(b), insert the following provision:



Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of Subcontracting Plans (XXX 1993)



(a) An offeror, other than a small business concern, submitting an offer that exceeds $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)
shall submit a subcontracting plan with its initial offer. The subcontracting plan will be negotiated concurrently
with price and any required technical and management proposals, unless the offeror submits a previously-approved
commercial products plan. Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small
business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. It is
the General Services Administration's (GSA's) expectation that an offeror's subcontracting plan will reflect
a commitment to assuring that small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns are provided
the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors
in the performance of the resulting contract.

(b) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, in addressing the eleven elements described
at FAR 52.219-9(d), the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program
for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the contract.
The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in any previous
contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally,
the offeror shall demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's
objectives, GSA's expectations, and actions necessary to meet these goals and expectations.

(c) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will_

(1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an understanding of the small business subcontracting
program's objectives and GSA's expectations with the respect to the program and has included all the information,
goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9;

Goals for Subcontracting Plan (XXX 1993)



(a) Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as
subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. The General Services Administration's
(GSA's) commitment to ensuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract, consistent
with its efficient performance, must be reflected in the offeror's subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR
52.219-9. In addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d), the offeror shall demonstrate
that its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned
small business concerns in performing this contract. The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the
offeror's subcontracting strategies used in previous contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will
build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally, the offeror shall demonstrate through its's plan that it understands
the small business subcontracting program's objectives, GSA's expectations, and actions necessary to meet these
goals and expectations.

(b) GSA believes that this contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Accordingly, it is anticipated that an acceptable subcontracting
plan will contain at least the following goals:




Small Business: 

XX

 percent

Small Disadvantaged Business: 

XX

 percent

Women-Owned Small Business: 

XX

 percent





Note:

 Target goals are expressed as a percentage of planned subcontracting dollars.

(c) In determining the acceptability of a subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will_

(1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an understanding of the small business subcontracting
program's objectives and GSA's expectations with respect to the program and has included all the information, goals,
and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9;

(2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry;

(3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from agencies administering national and local preference
programs and other advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan adequately reflect the anticipated
potential for subcontracting to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns; and

(4) Review, when applicable, the offeror's description of strategies, historical performance and significant
achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns.

(d) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or correct deficiencies in the plan within the time specified
by the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.



(End of Provision)



Alternate I (XXX 1993)



The Contracting Officer, as prescribed in 519.708(c) shall delete paragraph (b) of the basic provision and redesignate
paragraphs (c) and (d) as paragraphs (b) and (c).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 By a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) served June 4, 1993, and published at 58 FR 32340, June 9, 1993, the Commission
instituted this proceeding to determine whether off-bill discounting where it does or may result in a misrepresentation
of shipping charges should be found to be an unreasonable practice or otherwise unlawful. However, the ``Negotiated
Rates Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103-180), since has been enacted and amends subchapter IV of chapter 107 of title
49, United States Code, by adding section 10767. Section 10767 requires that the Commission establish regulations
to prohibit, except for certain services, motor common and contract carriers of property from providing a reduction
in a tariff rate or contract rate to a person who is a nonpayer of freight charges. The Commission must issue these regulations
by April 2, 1994. Because section 10767 supersedes the NPR, the Commission is discontinuing this proceeding.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS announces the intention of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) to prepare
an SEIS for proposed Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South
Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Councils and approved and implemented by the Secretary of Commerce under
provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The purpose of Amendment 2 is
to manage the harvest of ``live rock,'' living marine organisms attached to a hard substrate, such as dead coral or
rock, and used primarily in the marine aquarium trade. Management measures under consideration include a prohibition
on, or phase-out of, harvest of live rock with possible provisions for aquaculture; establishment of an annual quota
or limited access management program; and implementation of a permitting system for wild harvest or aquaculture.



The Councils intend to conduct a continuing public process to determine the scope of issues to be addressed and to identify
the significant issues related to live rock management. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of this ongoing
process and of the opportunity to participate by submitting written comments.



 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1989, the Florida Department of Natural Resources (FDNR) (now Department of Environmental Protection) determined
that live rock harvest (i.e., the collection of rocks with marine organisms attached for use in home aquariums) was
detrimental to the Florida Reef Tract and other hard bottom habitat areas. The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission
(FMFC) noted that the only current net production of the carbonate substrate underlying live rock occurs on living
coral reefs and, in Florida, these areas are either in equilibrium or eroding. FDNR personnel testified that more
than 90 percent of the live rock examined at the request of enforcement agents contained visible colonies of prohibited
corals, such as stony corals and sea fans. The FMFC concluded that live rock removal (1) can violate State and Federal
laws that prohibit taking of corals, (2) reduces the surface area and topographic complexity of Florida's coral reefs
and other live bottom areas, and (3) removes entire micro- communities along with targeted aquarium species. As a
result of these consideration, Florida prohibited live rock landings from State waters in May 1989. As a result of
this rulemaking, live rock harvesting efforts shifted to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Florida.



The FMFC has noted that in 1991 approximately 35 individuals reported combined landings of about 300 tons of live rock
from EEZ waters adjacent to the Florida Reef Tract, Florida's east coast reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico hard bottom areas.
In 1992, reported Florida landings from the EEZ totalled about 400 tons. 

Although the Councils have discussed the live rock issue, particularly pertaining to EEZ waters over recent years,
they took no regulatory action since the FMFC had decided to initiate rulemaking regarding live rock landings from
the EEZ off Florida. Specifically, the Councils deferred action since Florida's planned phase-out of live rock landings
appeared to address what seemed to be a Florida area management issue. 

In June 1992, the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved the FMFC rule to phase-out live rock landings in Florida from
the EEZ over a 3-year period ending on June 30, 1995. The phase-out was designed to allow development of live rock aquaculture
which would be exempt from the eventual total harvest ban. The phase-out was to be accomplished by a 25 percent annual
reduction in allowable landings (based on the 1991 reported landings) accompanied by a 500 pound daily vessel limit.


On March 31, 1993, a U.S. District Court Judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of Florida's
quota and vessel landing limits relating to possession or landing of live rock taken in the EEZ. Florida live rock fishermen
argued that the Magnuson Act superseded State landing laws and the Councils had made ``an affirmative and conscious
decision'' not to prohibit the taking of live rock in the EEZ.

Because of the District Court action, the Councils are now concerned that removal of live rock from the EEZ is currently
unregulated. Also, there is a growing interest in harvest of live rock from North Carolina to Alabama. In April 1993,
the South Atlantic Council approved a motion to include live rock in the FMP and reactivate the Coral Advisory Panel.
In May 1993, the Gulf Council, on being advised of recent live rock landings in Alabama, and at the request of that State
and Florida, initiated development of options for live rock management. In June 1993, the South Atlantic Council
held a public scoping meeting in Duck Key, Florida, to solicit input from the harvesters and the general public on the
management of live rock. In November 1993, the Councils prepared a draft Amendment 2 to the FMP to address live rock
issues, and established a schedule for further public hearings. See 

ADDRESSES 

to obtain a copy of this document. 

The Councils are considering the following management measures for Amendment 2 (with certain alternatives indicated).



Proposed Management Measures and Alternatives



A. Definitions for Management Unit



(1) Define live rock and add it to the management unit.

(2) Redefine allowable octocorals to eliminate taking of live rock under existing provisions of the FMP.



B. Management of the Live Rock Harvest



(1) No action.

(2) Harvest limits: a. establish an annual harvest quota for live rock; b. limit access and provide effort limits.

(3) Harvest prohibition: a. prohibit live rock harvest; b. phase-out live rock harvest; c. provide for aquaculture
of otherwise prohibited live rock.

(4) Provide for different management in the jurisdictional areas of the two councils.

(5) Permits: a. provide for a Federal permit for wild live rock harvest and possession; b. provide for a Federal permit
for possession and harvest of live rock from aquaculture; and c. provide for a Federal permit to take prohibited live
rock for scientific and educational purposes.

The South Atlantic Council's Habitat and Environmental Protection Committee prefers a prohibition on harvest and
possession of live rock on implementation of Amendment 2, possibly as early as 1994. The Gulf Council prefers to allow
three years of continued harvest after implementation of Amendment 2 to allow additional time for harvesters to convert
to aquaculture; subsequently, harvest and possession of live rock would be limited to persons with aquaculture permits.



Timetable for SEIS Preparation and Decisionmaking Schedule



The South Atlantic Council is holding public hearings on live rock management on January 5, 1994, in Savannah, Georgia,
on January 6 in Duck Key, Florida, and on January 13 in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The Gulf Council will hold
hearings on January 11, in Pensacola, Florida, and on January 19, in Clearwater Beach, Florida. Specific times and
locations are available from the Gulf Council listed above. The Gulf Council is scheduled to take action on the draft
amendment and a draft SEIS at its January 19 meeting in Clearwater Beach, Florida. The South Atlantic Council is scheduled
to take action on these draft documents at its February 7-11 meeting in St. Augustine, Florida. 

The draft SEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection agency in February or March 1994 for public
review and comment. Following a 45-day public comment period, a final SEIS will be prepared in support of the final
Amendment 2 to be submitted by the Councils to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval (expected by 1994).

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the Department's regulations on direct grant programs and State-administered programs
to clarify the requirements and procedures for establishing and applying indirect cost rates under programs administered
by the Department.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 To improve the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for grantees the procedures 
and requirements of the Department, the Secretary is proposing to revise sections in the Education Department General
Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) on indirect cost rates. 


A number of problems in this area of grants administration will be addressed by the proposed changes. For example,
the use of a restricted indirect cost rate for programs with supplement-not-supplant language in their authorizing
statutes is required by current regulations. However, State education agencies have incurred significant financial
liabilities by using incorrect restricted indirect cost rates. The proposed changes clarify how these rates are
calculated and so will reduce the likelihood of those errors recurring. In addition, the term ``occupancy and space
maintenance costs'' as used in the computation of restricted indirect cost rates has not been clearly defined, resulting
in grant recipients being reimbursed improperly for space costs. The inclusion of a definition in these proposed
regulations will address this problem.

The absence of a training grant definition has led to disagreements between the Department and grant recipients over
whether the training rate of eight percent, which is a lower rate than most recipients' negotiated rate, should be
applied to certain grants. The proposed definition will alleviate this problem and improve the Department's ability
to effectively administer these grants. Similarly, ambiguities in existing regulations on the use of indirect costs
for matching or cost-sharing and on the reimbursement of indirect costs to groups of 
eligible parties has contributed to administrative problems between the Department and its grant recipients. The
proposed changes will clarify for all parties how these special situations are to be handled. 

The existing regulations in these sections are being revised and reorganized and new sections are being added. Specifically,
the following sections are proposed for revision or addition: 

Section 75.129_This section is revised to include a reference to a new requirement in  75.564 on the determination
of indirect costs for a grant to a group of eligible parties. 

Section 75.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have
a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain
circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the regulatory

requirements of certain programs administered by the Department. 

Section 75.561_This section is revised to clarify the approval period for indirect cost rates established by the
Secretary. 

Section 75.562_This section is revised and expanded to include a definition of a training grant, a statement that
the Secretary decides which grants are training grants, a clarification of the base to which the training rate is applied,
and a restatement of the existing requirement that indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limitation may not
be charged 
directly or be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. It also explains that a grantee must have documentation
available to show that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent. 

Section 75.563_This section is revised to refer grantees subject to a restricted indirect cost rate to the new sections
in part 76 on restricted rates. 

Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed in order to transfer these sections on restricted indirect cost rates
to 
part 76. Since most grants under restricted rate programs are made to agencies of State or local governments, or their
subgrantees, the Secretary is proposing this change to clarify the applicability of these regulations. 

Section 75.564_This is a new section that includes several requirements applicable to the reimbursement of indirect
costs, including clarification on the use of indirect costs to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements and
the reimbursement of indirect costs under a grant to a group of eligible parties. The exclusion of certain categories
of grants from reimbursement for indirect costs is proposed, since these types of grants have very little overhead
or administrative costs associated with them. This exclusion is consistent with the current policy of the Department
of Health and Human Services. 

Section 76.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have
a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may 
establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted
indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.


Section 76.563 is revised to indicate the new sections in part 76 that apply to grantees subject to a restricted indirect
cost rate. 

Section 76.564_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current  75.564 and also includes the requirement
that indirect costs not recovered as a result of the restrictions may not be charged directly or charged to other Federal
awards. 

Section 76.565_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current  75.565. The term ``general management
costs'' is substituted for ``administrative charges'' to avoid confusion with the latter term as it is used in other
regulations. The section explains that the term general management costs includes some occupancy and space maintenance
costs. It also clarifies what is meant by the terms ``chief executive officer,'' which is used in place of ``chief administrative
officer,'' and ``component'' as these terms are used in this section. 

Section 76.566_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current  75.566 and clarifies which fringe
benefits may be used in determining fixed costs in a restricted rate calculation.

Section 76.567_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current  75.567 and explains that the term
``other expenditures'' also includes some occupancy and space maintenance costs and costs related to chief executive
officers and their offices. 
Section 76.568_This is a new section that defines what is meant by occupancy and space maintenance costs in the computation
of restricted indirect cost rates. The section also describes the limited circumstances in which those costs can
be charged directly. 
Section 76.569_This is a new section that revises the formula currently in  75.568 for computing indirect costs
under a restricted rate program to clarify the base to which the rate is applied. 


Executive Order 12866 


These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. For the most part these revisions are proposed to provide additional information to grantees
and to clarify existing departmental procedures or requirements. The proposed revisions will not result in major
changes in departmental policy that might have significant economic impact on small entities. 


Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 


These proposed regulations have been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been found to contain
no information collection requirements. 


Invitation to Comment 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 
All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during
and after the comment period, in room 3636, Regional Office Building No. 3, Seventh and D Streets SW., Washington,
DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays. 


Assessment of Educational Impact 


The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require
transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United
States.

The Secretary proposes to amend parts 75 and 76 of title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 


PART 75_DIRECT GRANT PROGRAMS 


1. The authority citation for part 75 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474, unless otherwise noted.




2. Section 75.129 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) and adding paragraph (a)(3), to read as follows:



 75.129 

Legal responsibilities of each member of the group. 


(a) * * * 
(1) The use of all grant funds; 
(2) Ensuring that the project is carried out by the group in accordance with Federal requirements; and 
(3) Ensuring that indirect cost funds are determined as required under  75.564(f). 


* * * * * 


3. Section 75.560 is amended by revising paragraph (b), adding new paragraphs (c) and (d), and revising the authority,
citation at the end of the section, to read as follows: 


 75.560 

General indirect cost rates; exceptions. 


* * * * * 


(b) A grantee must have a current indirect cost rate agreement to charge indirect costs to a grant. To obtain an indirect
cost rate, a grantee must submit an indirect cost proposal to the cognizant Federal agency and negotiate an indirect
cost rate agreement. 
(c) The Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate for a grantee that does not have an indirect cost rate
agreement with its cognizant Federal agency. 
(d) The Secretary accepts an indirect cost rate negotiated by a grantee's cognizant Federal agency, but may establish
a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered
by the Department. 





(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474) 




4. Section 75.561 is amended by revising paragraph (c), to read as follows: 


 75.561 

Approval of indirect cost rates. 


* * * * * 


(c) The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may
be approved for periods longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be sufficiently stable to justify
a longer rate period.





(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474) 




5. Section 75.562 is revised to read as follows: 


 75.562 

Indirect cost rates for educational training projects. 


(a) Educational training grants provide funding for training or other educational services. Examples of the work
supported by training grants are summer institutes, training programs for selected participants, the introduction
of new or expanded courses, and similar instructional undertakings, including special research training programs,
that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the sponsoring institution. These grants do not usually support
activities involving research, development, and dissemination of new educational materials and methods. Training
grants largely implement previously developed materials and methods and require no significant adaptation of techniques
or instructional services to fit different circumstances. 
(b) The Secretary determines which grants are educational training grants. 
(c) Indirect cost reimbursement on a training grant is limited to the amount computed by applying the grantee's negotiated
indirect cost rate or a rate of eight percent, whichever is less, to a modified total direct cost base determined by
the Secretary. 
(1) The eight percent limit also applies to cost-type contracts under grants, if these contracts are for training
as defined in this section. 
(2) The eight percent limit does not apply to agencies of State or local governments, including federally recognized
Indian tribal governments, as defined in 34 CFR 80.3. 
(3) Indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limit may not be charged directly, used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing
requirements, or be charged to another Federal award. 
(d) A grantee using the training rate of eight percent is required to have documentation available for audit that shows
that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent.

7. Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed. 

8. A new  75.564 is added to read as follows: 



 75.564 

Reimbursement of indirect costs. 



(a) Reimbursement of indirect costs is subject to the availability of funds and statutory or administrative restrictions.
The extent to which indirect costs are reimbursed is a matter for determination between the Secretary and the grantee.


(b) The application of the rates and the determination of the direct cost base by a grantee must be in accordance with
the indirect cost rate agreement approved by the grantee's cognizant Federal agency. 

(c) Indirect cost reimbursement is not allowable under grants for_

(1) Fellowships and similar awards if Federal financing is exclusively in the form of fixed amounts such as scholarships,
stipend allowances, or the tuition and fees of an institution; 

(2) Construction grants; 

(3) Grants to individuals; 

(4) Grants to organizations located outside the territorial limits of the United States; 

(5) Grants to Federal organizations; and 

(6) Grants in support of conferences. 

(d) Indirect cost reimbursement on grants received under programs with statutory restrictions or other limitations
on indirect costs must be made in accordance with the restrictions in 34 CFR 76.564-76.569. 

(e) Under programs with matching or cost-sharing requirements, indirect costs that are unallowable as charges to
Federal funds may not be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. 

(f) Indirect costs for a group of eligible parties (see   75.127-75.129) are limited to the amount
derived by applying the rate of the applicant, or a restricted rate when applicable, to the grant in keeping with the
terms of the applicant's indirect cost rate agreement.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations 
governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The 
FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal 
Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the 
Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed 
to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The 
proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program loan 
cancellation provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and 
guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to 
implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education 
Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325), enacted July 23, 1992, as 
well as certain changes added by Public Law 103-208, enacted 
December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the 
efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to 
improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary 
education. 


Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings 


In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary 
convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public 
involvement in the development of proposed regulations. The 
purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive 
discussion and exchange of information concerning the 
implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102-325. In 
addition, attendees at the regional meetings were asked to 
nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated 
rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. 
The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in 
San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; 
and Kansas City, Missouri. Each participant at the regional 
meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to 
discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. 
Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its 
discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented 
to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the 
proposed regulations. 
The issues addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
were discussed by one of the groups at each regional meeting. 
The specific recommendations made at those meetings are addressed 
below. The Secretary considered these comments in preparing 
draft proposed regulations. 


1. Loan Discharge for Borrowers Attending Schools That 
Close 


Public Law 102-325 added section 437(c) to the HEA to provide 
that loans will be canceled for student borrowers who are unable 
to complete their program of study because the school closed. 
The specific issues described below were discussed in connection 
with this section.

<TEXT>
 

a. Criteria 



The statute requires that, to qualify for a cancellation, 
the borrower must be ``unable to complete his or her program'' 
because the school closed. Participants at the San Francisco 
meeting recommended that the cancellation be available to student 
borrowers who are in attendance at the school at the time the 
school closes, or are on a leave of absence or left the school 
within 60 days prior to the school's closure because of 
deteriorating conditions at the school. The participants at the 
New York meeting agreed that students who are registered at the 
time the school closed should have their loans canceled but 
recommended that the benefit also be provided to borrowers who 
left within 90 days prior to the school's closure. Participants 
at the Kansas City meeting endorsed the 60-day time frame but 
also recommended that the regulations focus on the date of any 
announcement that the school is closing if that is earlier than 
the actual date that the school closed. Participants at the 
Atlanta meeting recommended that loan cancellation be provided to 
students who are in attendance or on a leave of absence at the 
time the school closed. 



b. Prior Payments 



Participants at all of the meetings agreed that any payments 
made by the borrower prior to discharge of the loan should be 
refunded. 



c. Teach-Outs 



Participants at the meetings discussed whether a loan made 
to a student who is offered a teach-out of the program in which 
the student was enrolled should be canceled. The participants at 
the Atlanta meeting concluded that a loan should not be 
discharged if the student completed a teach-out during the 
academic year for which the loan was made, but that the loan 
should be discharged if the borrower did not take or did not 
complete a teach-out during that time. Participants at the New 
York and Kansas City meetings concluded that a borrower should 
have the option of whether to accept a teach-out and should have 
the loan discharged if the student does not choose or does not 
complete a teach-out program. Attendees at the San Francisco 
meeting stated that they believed that teach-outs do not work 
well in practice and that loans should be canceled if a borrower 
does not choose to complete the program through a teach-out. 



d. Extent of Cancellation 



Attendees at each of the meetings also discussed whether 
loans should be canceled only for the academic term for which the 
borrower received the loan or whether all loans received for the 
program should be canceled. Attendees at the Atlanta meeting 
agreed that only the loan made for the period in which the school 
closed should be canceled. Participants at the meetings in New 
York and San Francisco (and a substantial minority in Atlanta) 
recommended that the regulations distinguish between students 
enrolled in certificate programs and students enrolled in degree 
programs. The attendees at those meetings believed that 
certificate students were unlikely to be able to transfer the 
credits earned at the closed school and should have all loans 
canceled, but that students attending degree-granting schools are 
likely to be able to transfer their credits and should only 
receive cancellation of the loan for the period in which the 
school closed. 



e. Process and Documentation Requirements



Attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that the 
Secretary be responsible for notifying the guaranty agencies when 
a school closes and that the agencies would be responsible for 
notifying the lenders of the loans eligible for cancellation. 
The attendees at that meeting also recommended that collection 
activity be suspended on the affected loans and that public 
service announcements be used to notify possibly affected 
students but that the students not be required to complete any 
applications or paperwork to prove their entitlement. The 
attendees at the Atlanta meeting also recommended that the 
Secretary or a State agency be responsible for determining that a 
school has closed and that the agencies would notify the affected 
lenders. The attendees at that meeting also recommended that the 
borrower not be required to provide documentation and recommended 
that credit bureau reporting be suspended during the 
investigation of possibly affected loans. Attendees at the New 
York meeting recommended that the date of a school's closure be 
determined by the applicable State licensing authority and also 
recommended that the student not be required to provide 
documentation of eligibility for cancellation of the loan. 



2. Discharge of Loans for Borrowers Whose Eligibility was 
Falsely Certified by the School



Section 437(c) to the HEA also provided that loans will be 
canceled for borrowers whose eligibility to borrow was falsely 
certified by the school. The specific issues described below 
were discussed in connection with this section. 



a. Definition of ``False Certification'' 



Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that 
the Department's regulations provide that the following 
situations should be considered ``false certification:'' a school 
certifies an application for a borrower who is not eligible 
because he or she does not have the ability to benefit from the 
training offered; there is fraud by the school in completing or 
certifying the loan application or the school cashes checks 
without the borrower's endorsement; or the school submits an 
incorrect budget, wrong expected family contribution, or other 
information vital to the determination of the borrower's 
eligibility. The participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended 
that the definition of ``false certification'' include forged 
checks, falsification of the student's program eligibility or 
eligibility for a particular loan amount, and falsification of 
the borrower's signature. Participants at the New York meeting 
recommended that the Department define ``false certification'' as 
including the situation in which the school falsely certifies 
that it is an eligible institution.

b. Need for Showing of Intent 


Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that 
the regulations provide that ``false certification'' must relate to 
the school's intent to deceive and not include a clerical error. 
The participants at the New York meeting, who also discussed this 
issue, did not reach a consensus regarding the requirement for a 
showing of intent by the school. 



c. Procedures 



Only the attendees at the Atlanta meeting discussed the 
procedures that should be utilized in implementing the provision 
for discharge of loans in cases of false certification. 
Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that the 
regulations provide that the determination of a false 
certification can be made by the Department, the guaranty 
agency, or the courts. They also recommended that if the 
guaranty agency makes the decision, the regulations should allow 
the school to appeal that decision to the Secretary. 
Participants at that meeting also recommended that a lender be 
required to notify the guaranty agency within 30 days of 
receiving a complaint that a loan was falsely certified and that 
collection activity be suspended while the agency investigates 
the claim. The agency would be required to complete its 
investigation within 6 months. 



3. Repayment of Bankruptcy Claims 



Public Law 102-325 changed the procedure for payment of 
bankruptcy claims by the Department and requires the Secretary to 
repay the loan if collection of the loan is stayed under Title 11 
of the Bankruptcy Code. Participants at all of the regional 
meetings recommended that the Department define ``stay'' in 
accordance with the current definition in the Bankruptcy Code. 
However, in response to the Department's question regarding the 
appropriate procedure for handling loans that are not ultimately 
discharged in bankruptcy, there were differences of opinion. The 
attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that if a loan 
was not likely to be discharged by the bankruptcy court, the 
guaranty agency should obtain the loan from the lender and hold 
it until the bankruptcy court action is completed and then return 
it to the lender. Attendees at the New York meeting recommended 
that lenders be permitted to file bankruptcy claims for payment 
directly to the Secretary and if the Secretary wanted the 
guaranty agency to service the account, the agency should be 
permitted to receive at least a portion of any repayment. They 
also recommended that the lender be given the option to 
repurchase any loan that is not discharged in bankruptcy. 
Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that lenders be 
required to repurchase any loans not discharged on which a claim 
was paid. Because this amendment has now been superseded by 
section 2(c)(63) of Public Law 103-208, which incorporated the 
provisions found in current FFEL Program regulations, these 
comments are now moot. 



4. Garnishment 


The last statutory provision reflected in these proposed 
regulations is section 488A of the HEA, which establishes a 
national wage garnishment law. That section was added by Public Law 
102-164, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, and 
was not discussed during the regional meetings or the negotiated 
rulemaking sessions. 



Negotiated Rulemaking 



After completion of the regional meetings, the Department 
prepared draft proposed regulations to implement the provisions 
of Public Law 102-325 relating to the FFEL Program. In accordance 
with the requirements of section 492(b) of the HEA, those 
regulations were submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. 
During the weeks of January 4-8 and February 1-5, 1993, the 
Department met with negotiators selected from among individuals 
nominated by attendees at the regional meetings. 
The discussion below of the proposed regulations reflects 
those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus and the 
proposed regulations reflect that agreement. The discussion 
below also indicates where consensus was not reached during the 
negotiations. However, the negotiators did not choose to discuss 
every part of the proposed regulations. Accordingly, the 
discussion below of those issues not discussed during the 
negotiations reflects only the views of the Secretary.

Proposed Regulatory Changes 


Section 682.202 Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers 



The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
section 427A of the HEA. The changes in this section include the 
creation of variable interest rates for new Stafford loan 
borrowers and the return of excess interest to certain Stafford 
loan borrowers. 

The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need 
an additional 250,000 hours to comply with the requirement that 
excess interest be returned to certain Stafford loan borrowers. 
This requirement is taken directly from the HEA. 



Section 682.208 Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan 



The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA. Under the regulations, in cases 
where the holder of the loan remains the same, but there is a 
servicing change that results in a change in the identity of the 
party to whom the borrower must send payments or direct 
communications, the Secretary would apply the same borrower 
notification requirements that are required by current 
regulations at 34 CFR 682.208(e) when a loan is sold or 
transferred. 

The Secretary does not view this requirement as one that 
imposes any additional burden because lenders and servicers 
already notify borrowers, as a normal business practice, whenever 
there is a servicing change that results in a change in the 
identity of the party to whom the borrower must send payments or 
direct communications. This requirement is taken directly from 
the HEA. 



Section 682.402 Death, Disability, Closed School, False 
Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments 



The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
section 437 of the HEA. The regulations reflect the new 
statutory provision for cancellation of a parent's PLUS loan if 
the student for whom the parent borrowed died. This was not a 
subject of controversy at the regional meetings or during the 
negotiations. 

The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the 
HEA with regard to the discharge of a borrower's liability on an 
FFEL Program loan if the student was unable to complete an 
educational program because of the closure of the school. In 
developing criteria to be used to determine a borrower's 
eligibility for a closed school loan discharge, the Secretary 
believes that a student who completed his or her educational 
program by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the 
closed school to another school, or who completed the program 
through a teach-out of the educational program at a different 
school, should not qualify for a loan cancellation. The 
Secretary believes that the closed school discharge was intended 
to benefit students who could not complete their education 
because their school closed, and does not believe that a student 
who was able to complete the educational program for which the 
loan paid should be able to avoid repaying that loan. The 
Secretary is particularly interested in receiving public comment 
as to the appropriate treatment of a borrower's loan obligations 
if the educational program for which the loan was obtained was a 
multi-year program and the student was able to complete one or 
more years of that program. 

The Secretary also believes, contrary to the majority 
sentiment expressed at the regional meetings and by the 
negotiators, that a borrower should submit to the holder a sworn 
statement that demonstrates that the borrower is eligible for a 
closed school discharge to assist the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designees in pursuing claims against the closed 
school, and to secure the borrower
s written commitment to the 
representations on which he or she seeks relief. The Secretary 
believes that an affidavit or sworn statement is essential in 
protecting the interests of the federal taxpayer, and therefore 
proposes that one be obtained from the student as a condition of 
loan discharge. By virtue of Federal law (28 U.S.C. 1746), this 
affidavit or statement need not be notarized, but the borrower 
must state in the document that the borrower makes the statement 
under penalty of perjury.

<TEXT>
 

The Secretary agrees with the sentiment expressed at the 
regional meetings and by the negotiators that conditions at the 
school immediately preceding its closing may cause a 
deterioration in the educational program that would cause a 
student to withdraw. A student who withdraws under these 
circumstances should be deemed to have been unable to complete 
his or her educational program because of the school's closure. 
For purposes of considering the borrower eligible for loan 
discharge, and to balance the interests of the borrower and the 
federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each 
cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal 
period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school 
closed. 



False Certification by a School of a Student's Eligibility To 
Borrow 



Participants in the regional meetings and the negotiators 
offered a wide variety of different actions by the school or the 
borrower that they believed should be considered a false 
certification of eligibility to borrow; these included virtually 
every express or implied representation in any way related to the 
FFEL Program made by the student to the school, or by the school 
to the lender, guarantor, accrediting agency, state authority, or 
the Secretary. The Secretary has not adopted these views in the 
proposed regulations, because the language of the statute itself 
and its legislative history shows that the intended scope of the 
authority to discharge loan obligations is considerably narrower 
than these commenters suggest. The statute authorizes discharge 
only if the school made a false ``certification of the student's 
eligibility,'' a term used only in the FFEL Program regulations, 
where it refers, only to those representations made by the school 
on the loan application itself regarding the status of the loan 
applicant (or the student for whom a parent wishes to obtain a 
PLUS loan) as an eligible student, 34 CFR 682.603; 682.201; and 
668.7, and not to other written representations that relate to 
the borrower's request for a loan, the school's participation in 
the FFEL Program, or the quality of the school
s program, 
facilities, or placement services. The legislative history 
further explains that this provision was intended to provide 
relief where the student was ``left without the skills needed to 
obtain employment'' because of the false certification of 
eligibility. H. R. Rep. No. 447, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. 52 (1991). 
The scope of the relief proposed by the Secretary here is guided 
by these two principles: that the false certification be that 
made by the school on the loan application regarding the 
borrower's eligibility, and that the falsity of the certification 
be directly related to the failure to provide necessary skills 
for employment. 

Some negotiators urged that grounds for cancellation should 
include such falsifications as forgery of the borrower's 
signature on the loan application or on the loan disbursement 
check. However, these representations are not part of the 
process of the ``certification of the student's eligibility to 
borrow.'' Moreover, as a practical matter, a borrower victimized 
by a forged loan application can be injured only if the 
borrower's endorsement is then forged on the loan disbursement 
check, or the check is negotiated without the borrower's 
endorsement at all. In either case, the borrower is generally 
not liable because such a loan is generally not legally 
enforceable. Therefore, not only does forgery not constitute a 
falsification in the loan ``certification'' process, but the 
borrower who is the victim of a forgery and did not receive the 
proceeds of the loan already has a complete defense to repayment 
of the loan, and needs no cancellation relief under this new 
section. 

Other negotiation participants suggested that erroneous 
school representations on a loan application regarding such 
matters as the borrower's (or student's) income, resources, 
family contribution, or recommended loan amount should be 
sufficient to constitute grounds for cancellation under this 
section. This kind of error could result in the borrower 
receiving a loan in a larger amount than he or she qualifies to 
receive. However, that student may nevertheless receive quality 
training at the school, and this kind of error or 
misrepresentation does not directly or invariably cause the 
borrower to be ``left without the skills needed to obtain 
employment.'' In addition, errors or misstatements of the 
borrower's financial need frequently result in the borrower 
receiving a loan either that only marginally exceeds the amount 
for which he or she actually qualified, or that qualified only 
for reinsurance but not for interest subsidies. Section 437(c) 
directs the discharge of the ``borrower's liability on the loan''_language that does not suggest that a partial discharge
was 
contemplated or intended; discharging the borrower from financial 
obligation for the entire loan in such circumstances where the 
misstatement of financial need affects only part of the loan, or 
only the borrower's right to interest subsidies on all or part of 
that loan, is a remedy completely out of proportion to any injury 
suffered by the borrower as a result of the erroneous 
certification of his or her financial need. For these reasons, 
the Secretary concludes that erroneous representations of the 
borrower's financial need are not the kind of false 
certifications for which section 437 was intended to provide 
relief.

In general, participants at the regional meetings and the 
negotiations recognized that grounds for cancellation of a loan 
obligation under section 437 of the HEA should include a case 
where a student was unable to obtain employment after attending 
the school, and the school had falsely certified that the student 
had the ability to benefit from the school's training. This kind 
of falsification is both part of the loan certification process 
and results in a student being left without needed skills. 
Therefore, the proposed regulations focus on the school's false 
representation that the student had the ability to benefit as the 
grounds for cancellation under this new provision. 

The statute and regulations have addressed the ability-to-benefit requirement for many years, and the proposed
regulations 
reflect both the legal elements of that requirement and some 
enforcement perspectives developed in implementing it. For 
example, the school has always been required to test the ability 
to benefit only of those applicants who did not have a high 
school diploma, and the school therefore does not certify 
anything regarding the ability to benefit of high school 
graduates. Since 1987, students who had a general education 
diploma, or obtained one after enrolling, and students who lacked 
both a GED and a high school diploma but completed an 
institutionally prescribed remedial education program, have been 
deemed by Congress to have the ability to benefit, and the rule 
would incorporate that congressional judgement. 

The regulations therefore would generally permit relief in 
the case of a student whom the school was required to test for 
ability to benefit, but either failed to test at all, or tested 
in disregard of the requirements for proper use of the test 
adopted. Schools have a continuing legal obligation to 
administer tests, subject to criteria developed by the school's 
accreditor, in compliance with test protocols. These criteria 
and protocols may include requirements related both to the 
accuracy of the test results as to the individual tested and to 
the continuing development and validation of the test mechanism. 
Non-compliance with testing requirements may warrant 
administrative sanctions against the school, but a false 
certification claim under this provision requires the Department 
to determine a different question. 

A false certification claim depends not on whether the 
school met all its obligations with regard to testing, but on 
whether a test already given lacks credibility as a measure of 
the student's ability to benefit so that the Department should, 
in the absence of other evidence, regard the student as lacking 
that ability. The Secretary expects that practical, specific 
standards will be needed to help identify those deviations from 
testing requirements that support an inference that the student 
lacked ability to benefit. For example, use of photocopied 
versions of tests by the school or test administrator may violate 
the requirements of the test publisher, but may have no direct 
effect on the accuracy of the assessment of the student's ability 
to benefit. Use of an indefensibly low cutoff score by the 
school on an ability-to-benefit test does not discredit an 
assessment of the ability of those students who score above a 
legitimate cutoff score, such as those now published by the 
Secretary. Similarly, minor deviations from required time limits 
may have little effect on the validity of the test results. The 
Secretary intends to address these practical considerations in 
the final regulations, and invites public comment on the content 
of those standards or guidelines. 

In applying these standards, moreover, the Secretary has 
consistently recognized that a student may actually have the 
ability to benefit from the school's training even though the 
school does not test that student's ability or does so 
improperly. The proposed regulations therefore recognize that a 
student who actually obtains employment in the occupation for 
which the school's program was designed to prepare him or her had 
the actual ability to benefit from that training without regard 
to whether the school falsified its test of ability to benefit. 

A student not properly tested for ability to benefit who 
nevertheless completes the program of instruction can reasonably 
be considered to have found the training consistent with his or 
her aptitude, and the proposed regulations would provide for 
cancellation only if the a student had unsuccessfully tried to 
find employment in the occupation for which the program was 
designed to prepare him or her. Conversely, a student not 
properly tested who withdraws from the course can be reasonably 
regarded as having found the training not consistent with his or 
her aptitude, and the proposed regulations grant relief to this 
kind of student (or a parent PLUS borrower who borrowed on behalf 
of the student) unless the student actually obtained employment 
in that occupation.

Consistent with the approach that the student's ability to 
benefit should be evaluated realistically, the proposed 
regulations would recognize that those individuals admitted on 
the basis of their ability to benefit who met one or more of the 
several statutory requirements would nevertheless be regarded as 
not having had that ability if they had a physical, mental, or 
personal impediment to employment in, or performance of the 
physical duties of, the occupation for which the program was 
designed. Individuals with certain kinds of criminal records or 
a history of mental illness may be barred from some positions for 
which the school proposed to train them, and these students could 
not benefit from the training even if they successfully completed 
a test sanctioned by both the industry and school's accrediting 
agency. Other students may lack the physical ability to perform 
a job for which their grades on an industry and accreditor-approved test might otherwise show an ability to perform.
Both 
kinds of students would qualify (or qualify the parent PLUS 
borrower) for relief under these regulations. 

A number of other kinds of falsification were considered as 
potential grounds for discharge of the loan under this provision, 
including a school's acceptance of a student into an ineligible 
program, but they were not adopted in these proposed regulations. 
As explained earlier, the statute uses fairly precise language to 
describe the grounds for discharge under this provision, and that 
language, by authorizing discharge where there has been a false 
certification ``by the eligible institution,'' does not authorize 
relief where the falsity relates to the eligibility of the 
institution itself. Thus, although misrepresentations regarding 
the school's financial or administrative capability, including 
the school's placement services or the quality of the school's 
facilities, faculty, or equipment, may well have induced the 
individual to enroll at the school, those representations are not 
part of the process of ``certification'' of the student's 
eligibility to borrow, tend to constitute claims that the 
institution was in fact not an ``eligible institution,'' and are 
not the kind of representations for which this statute authorizes 
relief. These proposed regulations therefore do not treat 
falsifications by the institution about itself as grounds for 
discharge. 

For the vocational schools that are the primary focus of 
this statutory provision, representations about the eligibility 
of the institution include representations about the eligibility 
of its programs, and, under the statute and regulations, the 
institution is virtually defined in terms of the programs it 
offers. 20 U.S.C. 1088 (1992); 34 CFR 600.7, 668.7(a)(2)(v). 
Therefore, because the statute confines relief precisely to 
instances of false certifications regarding the eligibility of 
the student, not on representations that would tend to show that 
the institution itself was not eligible, the Secretary does not 
believe that the statute authorizes relief where the alleged 
misrepresentation goes to the eligibility of the program in which 
the student was enrolled. For these reasons, relief under the 
proposed regulations would not permit a borrower to secure 
cancellation by challenging the eligibility of the program or the 
school itself, but would require a demonstration by the student 
that the school failed to test (or tested improperly) his or her 
ability to benefit and that he or she did not secure employment 
in the occupation for which the school stated its program was 
designed to prepare the student. 


Bankruptcy Claims 



Section 437(a) of the HEA as amended by the Higher Education 
Amendments of 1992 allowed a lender to submit and receive payment 
on a bankruptcy claim on the date on which the borrower filed for 
relief in bankruptcy, an action that ``stays collection'' of the 
loan, rather than when the loan was discharged, as under prior 
law. The proposed regulations submitted to the negotiation 
process would have revised current regulations as needed to 
implement this change. Other features of current bankruptcy 
claim processing were to remain unchanged. Section 2(c)(63) of 
Public Law 103-208 reinstated standards for payment of bankruptcy 
claims consistent with those now found in FFEL Program 
regulations at 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5); pursuant to section 5 of 
Public Law 103-208, this most recent change took effect as if 
enacted as part of the 1992 amendments. Any regulations needed 
to implement this change, moreover, are not subject to negotiated 
rulemaking requirements of section 492. To implement the new law, 
the Secretary is here withdrawing those proposals found in 34 CFR 
682.402(f)(5) and (g)(2) (iv) and (v) as presented to the 
negotiators prior to the enactment of Public Law 103-208, and will 
leave in effect the provisions of current 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5), 
redesignated here as  682.402(g)(5), and current 
 682.402(e)(2)(ii), redesignated here as  682.402(g)(2)(iv).

By allowing a filing of a claim on the date ``collection of 
the loan is stayed''_the date of the filing of the petition by 
the borrower, or, in a Chapter 13 case, by the endorser or the 
borrower_rather than the date a borrower receives a discharge, 
the statute might be read to permit claims to be submitted if an 
endorser files, rather than, as under prior law, only in borrower 
bankruptcies. Nothing in the amendments suggested that such a 
result was intended, and the proposed regulations would permit 
the submission of a bankruptcy claim only in the case of a 
borrower bankruptcy. 
The proposed regulations would continue to require lenders 
to file proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, unless the 
guaranty agency directs otherwise or the holder is officially 
notified by the court that no assets are available for 
distribution. If the guaranty agency later receives notice that 
assets have become available, the guarantor must file a proof of 
claim at that point. 
Participants in the negotiated rulemaking proceedings noted 
that a growing number of discharges were being received by 
borrowers who file sequential bankruptcy petitions, particularly 
those who first file for relief in Chapter 13. During the 
pendency of the prior bankruptcy case, loans in repayment less 
than seven years are non-dischargeable without proof of undue 
hardship, yet cannot be enforced by the holder according to their 
original terms; little or nothing may be paid on those loans 
during the proceeding. Rather than attempting to show that 
repayment would constitute an undue hardship, or negotiating an 
income-sensitive repayment arrangement with the holder, borrowers 
who complete their Chapter 13 proceeding may then file a second 
bankruptcy petition, making sure that the second is filed more 
than seven years after the loan entered repayment. 
The Bankruptcy Code excludes the period of ``any applicable 
suspension of the repayment period'' from the seven-year period 
during which loans are dischargeable only for undue hardship. 11 
U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A). If the term ``suspension of the repayment 
period'' is read, as these borrowers contend, to include only 
forbearance or deferments granted by the holder of the loan, the 
reality of the forbearance imposed by virtue of the automatic 
stay in the prior bankruptcy_which barred enforcement of the 
loan according to its terms during the pendency of the bankruptcy_would be ignored, and borrowers who have neither
made the 
required seven-year attempt to repay nor demonstrated undue 
hardship would obtain a discharge in the second bankruptcy. The 
Secretary does not consider this interpretation of the statute to 
be consistent with its purpose, and the only court that has 
addressed this precise issue has concluded that the period during 
which enforcement of a loan is stayed in a prior bankruptcy is an 
``applicable suspension of the repayment period'' for purposes of 
computing the seven-year period for a subsequent bankruptcy. 

In 
re Saburah,

 136 B.R. 246, 254 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1992). 
In light of the above discussion, the Secretary proposes to 
interpret the term ``applicable suspension of the repayment 
period'' to include periods during which the automatic stay in a 
bankruptcy proceeding is in effect. The Secretary further 
recognizes that a borrower who in fact meets his or her 
obligation under the original repayment agreement during the 
bankruptcy has acted in a manner consistent with the intent of 
the statute, and this proposed interpretation would not regard 
the period of the first bankruptcy as a period of suspension of 
repayment for the borrower. 
The death and bankruptcy requirements in proposed  682.402 
are taken directly from the HEA. There is no change to the 
current disability cancellation. 


Closed School Cancellations


The closed school cancellation provision is taken, in large 
part, directly from the mandates of the HEA, although the 
proposed regulations reflect some areas of necessary 
interpretation. The discussion that follows is grouped into 
three major areas where the Secretary and the negotiators had 
discretion to interpret the statutory closed school cancellation 
provision: 


1. Student Withdrawal Prior to the Closing of the School


There was unanimous agreement among the negotiators and the 
Secretary that it would be inequitable to strictly limit a closed 
school cancellation to only those students who were in attendance 
at the school on the date that the school officially closed. As 
discussed earlier, conditions at the school immediately preceding 
its closing may have caused a deterioration in the educational 
program that would have prompted a student to withdraw. Such a 
student should not lose entitlement to a loan cancellation 
because of his or her prescience or inability to tolerate the 
school's deterioration. To balance the interests of students and 
the federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each 
cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal 
period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school 
closed. 


2. Student Use of Teach-out or Transfer of Academic 
Credits 


As discussed earlier, the Secretary does not believe that a 
student who completed the educational program for which the loan 
was intended, even though the completion occurred through a 
teach-out at another school or by the student's transfer of 
academic credits earned at the closed school, should be able to 
avoid repaying that loan. The student is not required to 
transfer those credits or make use of a teach-out opportunity, 
but if the student chooses to do so, then the Secretary believes 
that, because the student was able to complete the educational 
program, it would be unfair to require the Federal taxpayer to 
pay the student's loan. 


3. Student Statement Requirement


The Secretary believes that a statement made by the student 
under penalty of perjury demonstrating eligibility for a closed 
school discharge should be obtained from the student to assist 
the Secretary or the Secretary's designees in pursuing claims 
against the closed school. Without this statement, the 
Secretary's ability to protect the interests of the Federal 
taxpayer would be frustrated.

Section 682.410 Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement 
Requirements



The administrative wage garnishment requirements are taken 
directly from the HEA. 

The proposed regulations provide an alternative to the 
prescribed collection requirements in  682.410(b) if a guaranty 
agency uses collection agencies and administrative wage 
garnishment. Through these regulations, the Secretary expects to 
maximize default collections by the Department of Education, 
guaranty agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service. 

The proposed regulations implement the national wage 
garnishment provision in section 488A of the HEA, under which 
guaranty agencies or the Secretary may garnish up to 10 percent 
of the wages of a borrower who has defaulted on an FFEL Program 
loan or who is not making required payments under a repayment 
agreement. Under the proposed regulations, at least 30 days 
before garnishment proceedings are initiated the borrower must be 
given written notice informing him or her of the nature and 
amount of the loan obligation to be collected, the intention of 
the guaranty agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt 
through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's 
rights regarding the proposed action. 

The proposed regulations provide the borrower with an 
opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the debt, 
establish a new repayment agreement, and receive a hearing 
concerning the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of a 
repayment schedule. In addition, no withholding of a debtor's 
wages may occur in the case of an individual who has been 
involuntarily separated from employment until that individual has 
been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. These 
proposed regulations would replace current regulatory provisions 
that authorize wage garnishment by guaranty agencies in certain 
circumstances. 

Section 488A of the HEA protects borrowers by prohibiting 
employers from taking disciplinary action against an individual 
based on the fact that the individual's wages are subject to 
garnishment. The statute permits a borrower to sue an employer 
who takes such an action, and authorizes the court to award 
attorneys' fees, punitive damages, back pay, reinstatement, or 
other remedies the court believes reasonably necessary. 

Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might 
prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts. The 
Secretary particularly requests comments on whether there are 
other state laws that might frustrate the purpose of section 488A 
and should be preempted. The Secretary asks commenters to 
provide specific information on those laws. 



Section 682.411 Due Diligence by Lenders in the Collection of 
Guaranty Agency Loans



The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the 
HEA by requiring lenders to warn borrowers and endorsers about 
the possibility that their wages may be garnished by the guaranty 
agency if they default on their repayment obligations.

There are minimal burdens, if any, that will be associated 
with including a warning about possible wage garnishment in the 
delinquency letters that are already required to be sent to 
borrowers. 



Executive Order 12866 



These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those 
sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the 
regulations. Burdens specifically associated with information 
collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained 
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with State, 
local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their 
governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
efficient administration of the program. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 

Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance 
requirements are imposed on guaranty agencies, lenders, and 
schools by the regulations. These requirements, however, would 
not have a significant impact because they would not impose 
excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal 
supervision. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 682.208, 682.402, and 682.410 contain information 
collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of 
these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for 
its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 

These regulations affect the following types of entities 
that participate in the FFEL Program: Guaranty agencies, lenders, 
and schools. The Department needs and uses this information to 
properly carry out its responsibility to administer certain 
aspects of the HEA. 

Annual public reporting burden for this collection of 
information is not expected to significantly increase. The 
collection and reporting of the information in   682.208 and 
682.410 reflect normal business practice, whereas the closed 
school cancellation provision of  682.402 essentially substitutes 
a closed school claim for a default claim that normally would 
have occurred if the student did not repay a loan made for 
attendance at a school that closed. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on 
the information collection requirements should direct them to the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New 
Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: 
Daniel J. Chenok. 



Invitation To Comment 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and 
recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 

All comments submitted in response to these proposed 
regulations will be available for public inspection, during and 
after the comment period, in ROB-3, room 4310, 7th and D Streets, 
SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.




Assessment of Educational Impact 



The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the 
proposed regulations in this document would require transmission 
of information that is being gathered by or is available from any 
other agency or authority of the United States.

The Secretary proposes to amend title 34 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations by revising part 682 as follows: 



PART 682_FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM 



1. The authority citation for part 682 continues to read as 
follows: 






Authority:

 20 U.S.C. 1071 to 1087-2, unless otherwise noted. 




2. Section 682.202 has been amended by revising paragraphs 
(a) introductory text, and (a)(1) through (a)(4); adding a new 
paragraph (a)(6); and revising paragraphs (c) and (d) to read as 
follows: 



 682.202 

Permissible charges by lenders to borrowers. 



* * * * *



(a) 

Interest.

 The applicable interest rates for FFEL 
Program loans are given in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of 
this section. 

(1) 

Stafford Loan Program.

 (i) If the borrower, on the 
date the promissory note evidencing the loan is signed, has an 
outstanding balance of principal or interest on a previous 
Stafford loan, the interest rate is the applicable interest rate 
on that previous Stafford loan. 

(ii) If the borrower, on the date the promissory note 
evidencing the loan is signed, has no outstanding balance on any 
FFEL Program loan, and the first disbursement is made_

(A) Prior to October 1, 1992, for a loan covering a period 
of instruction beginning on or after July 1, 1988, the interest 
rate is 8 percent until 48 months elapse after the repayment 
period begins, and 10 percent thereafter; or 

(B) On or after October 1, 1992, the interest rate is a 
variable rate, applicable to each July 1-June 30 period, that 
equals the lesser of_

(

1

) The bond equivalent rate of the 91-day Treasury bills 
auctioned at the final auction prior to the June 1 immediately 
preceding the July 1-June 30 period, plus 3.10 percent; or 

(

2

) 9 percent. 

(iii) For a Stafford loan for which the first disbursement 
is made before October 1, 1992_

(A) If the borrower, on the date the promissory note 
evidencing the loan is signed, has no outstanding balance on a 
Stafford loan but has an outstanding balance of principal or 
interest on a PLUS or SLS loan made for a period of enrollment 
beginning before July 1, 1988, or on a Consolidation loan that 
repaid a loan made for a period of enrollment beginning before 
July 1, 1988, the interest rate is 8 percent; or 

(B) If the borrower, on the date the promissory note 
evidencing the loan is signed, has an outstanding balance of 
principal or interest on a PLUS or SLS loan made for a period of 
enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1988, or on a 
Consolidation loan that repaid a loan made for a period of 
enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 1988, the interest rate 
is 8 percent until 48 months elapse after the repayment period 
begins, and 10 percent thereafter. 

(iv) For a Stafford loan for which the first disbursement is 
made on or after October 1, 1992, if the borrower, on the date 
the promissory note evidencing the loan is signed, has no 
outstanding balance on a Stafford loan but has an outstanding 
balance of principal or interest on a PLUS, SLS, or Consolidation 
loan, the interest rate is 8 percent. 

(2) 

PLUS Program.

 (i) For a combined repayment schedule 
under  682.209(d), the interest rate is the weighted average of 
the rates of all loans included under that schedule. 

(ii) For a loan disbursed on or after July 1, 1987 but prior 
to October 1, 1992, and for any loan made under  682.209 (e) or 
(f), the interest rate is a variable rate, applicable to each 
July 1-June 30 period, that equals the lesser of_

(iii) For a loan disbursed on or after October 1, 1992, the 
interest rate is a variable rate, applicable to each July 1-June 
30 period, that equals the lesser of_

 682.402 

Death, disability, closed school, false certification, 
and bankruptcy payments. 



(a) 

General.

 (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and cancellation of loans due to
death, total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, and false certification by a school of
a borrower's eligibility for a loan, are set forth in this section. 

(2) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, or a Consolidation loan was obtained by a married couple,
and only one of the borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection of his or her loan obligation
stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated
to repay the loan. 

(3) A loan qualifies for payment under this section only to the extent that the loan is legally enforceable under applicable
law by the holder of the loan. 

(4) For purposes of this section_

(i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative
tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment
that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-1-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant
to an objection presented in a proceeding prior to credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment,
or other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and 

(iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and
no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the
payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines
in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.


(b) 

Death.

 (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. 

(2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of
death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not
available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be canceled only if the guaranty agency determines that other
evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died. 

(3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the
information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that
the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the
lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite
diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender
shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance
as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended. 

(4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died,
the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser. 

(5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after
the date of the borrower's (or student's) death. 

(c) 

Total and permanent disability.

 (1) If the lender determines that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. A borrower is not considered totally
and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the
borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently
disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the
time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated,
so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation
loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans.

(d) 

Closed school.

 (1) 

General.

 (i) The Secretary reimburses the holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after January 1, 1986, and discharges
the borrower's obligation with respect to the loan, if the borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS
loan) could not complete the program of study for which the loan was intended because the school at which the borrower
(or student) was enrolled, closed, or the borrower (or student) withdrew from the school not more than 90 days prior
to the date the school closed.

conduct on which those claims were based, a borrower who requests or receives a discharge under paragraph (d) of this
section must cooperate with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. At the request of the Secretary or the Secretary's
designee, and upon the Secretary's or the Secretary's designee's tendering to the borrower of such fees and costs

was received, against the school, its principals, affiliates and their successors, its sureties, and any private
or public fund. 

(ii) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section applies notwithstanding any provision of State law that would
otherwise restrict transfer of such rights by the borrower (or student), limit or prevent a transferee from exercising

students, and report the results of its investigation to the 
Secretary no later than 30 days after receiving the information. 
(B) If a guaranty agency determines (or is informed by the

procedures for requesting a discharge. 
(ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and

a lender receives a payment made by or on behalf of the borrower 
on the loan after the lender files a claim on the loan with the 
guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the payment to the 
guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The lender shall 
assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining
