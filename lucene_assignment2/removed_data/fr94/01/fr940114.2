<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice, intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement on a proposal to harvest 30-40 million board
feet of both merchantable and unmerchantable wood products from approximately 8,000 acres of National Forest System
lands on the east side of Lake Tahoe in Nevada. Dead and dying trees would be cut, and a green tree thinning component
is also proposed to improve forest health. Jeffrey pine beetle suppression comprises part of the project. The proposed
action also uses prescribed fire and analyzes post sale treatments, including watershed improvement projects.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed action harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately
8,000 acres of an 11,000-acre study area. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands, over about 2,000 acres,
some of which overlap the salvage acreage, and some of which is separate. Some of the 30 to 40 million board feet removed
will be useful lumber; much of the timber removed will have no commercial value. 




Trees would be removed from gentle slopes by tractor skidding systems. Trees would be flown from steeper terrain by
helicopter. No new permanent roads would be constructed; however, construction of additional temporary access
roads and landing sites would be required, as well as reconstruction and restoration of existing historic roads.
This proposed action includes treatments that will follow removal of the trees. This includes (but is not limited
to) site preparation, planting, treatment of slash generated by the project, obliteration of temporary and unneeded
roads, and restoration of landings. Monitoring how effectively the project prevents future beetle attacks is part
of ``post sale'' work. The use of prescribed fire will be analyzed, both as a post-harvest treatment and as a long-term
management tool. This alternative treats the most acres with prescribed fire.

Heritage (historic archaeological) resources are dispersed throughout the study area. Most are the remains of 19th
century logging, and not all of them will be protected. In addition to mitigation negotiated with the Advisory Council
of Historic Preservation, a key component of the analysis is to seek and address enhancement opportunities for representative
heritage properties.

Watershed restoration projects, road closures, and mistletoe reduction opportunities may also be included in the
proposed action if they are, in the language of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ``connected'', ``cumulative''
in their effects with the removal of dead trees, or are ``ripe for decision''.


This action is proposed because of current forest mortality stemming from historical activities. Beginning in the
1850's many of the 200-500 year old pine trees around Lake Tahoe were harvested in support of silver mining activities
of the Comstock Lode. Earlier, the forest and consisted of diverse species that resisted drought and insect attacks.
After logging slowed in the 1890's, the area began to revegetate naturally. But a new and different forest grew to replace
the old. In the absence of frequently recurring fires, dense thickets of moisture-loving fir trees replaced much
of the open pine forest that had been cut. The drought that began in 1987 weakened and killed those fir trees that had
sprouted after the massive Comstock cutting.

Forty years of fire suppression has dramatically increased the density of trees and the amount of dead wood, standing
or on the ground. Members of the public have expressed concern over the large numbers of dead trees the amount of forest
fuels now present. Many requests have been made for projects to remove timber to reduce safety hazards, fire danger,
and to improve visual quality. Such projects would reduce the ``fuel loading'' and could decrease the risk and severity
of a catastrophic fire. Additionally, thinning of overstocked stands can be an effective way to prevent future catastrophic
insect and disease outbreaks.
The environmental analysis provides the decisionmaker_the LTBMU Forest Supervisor with an evaluation of what will
happen if nothing is done, and what may result from the proposed action, and other alternatives Such disclosure will
allow a reasoned choice between management options. If an alternative other than No Action is preferable, then the
work has to proceed quickly. If actively infested trees are removed before the onset of summer when the beetles fly,
then fewer healthy trees may be attacked. On small scale, high value areas, such as the East Shore beaches, beetle suppression
work may reduce the number of large Jeffrey pines that die. Further, trees that are harvested quickly will have more
commercial value. The high cost of a predominantly helicopter operation could deter potential bidders as the soundness
of the trees declines. Consequently, project implementation is expected to begin during the summer or fall of 1994.
Over sixty agencies, organizations, and individuals were notified of this proposed project through the LTBMU NEPA
Status Report. A public meeting was held on October 5, 1993 as part of the scoping process. Some people also provided
written comments. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency staff was briefed about the project on November 10, 1993. The Nevada
State Historic Preservation Officer has also been briefed.
Originally conceived and publicly scoped as a project whose environmental analysis would be documented in an environmental
assessment, it was determined in late December 1993 that its potential environmental effects warrant an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS). Project activities will adversely affect heritage resources in a National Register-eligible
historic district.
While the type of NEPA documentation has changed since the project's conception, the project itself has not changed.
Consequently, only minimal additional public scoping will occur. A public and agency briefing on the project, to
be announced in the Tahoe Daily Tribune and through letters sent to those parties who have expressed interest in the
East Shore Project, will be held on January 26, 1994, at the El Dorado County Library at 1000 Rufus Allen Boulevard in
South Lake Tahoe. Participants in the planning process will be sent copies of the draft EIS for the public comment period.
Availability of the draft EIS will also be noticed in the 

Federal Register

, and the Tahoe Daily Tribune, the LTBMU's newspaper of record. Written comments and suggestions received by January
24, 1994 will be addressed in the draft EIS.
The ``no action'' alternative proposes a continuation of the current types of management activities currently conducted
in the study areas, without imposing impacts from logging to heritage resources. Trees which pose hazards to life
and property will be taken down. While the long-term management of the Genoa Peak road system is primarily for off-highway
vehicle use, road reconstruction and maintenance at a logging truck standard along a portion of the road will be required
to accommodate log haul for timber sales on the adjacent Toiyabe National Forest, as analyzed in the Carson District's
Spooner Salvage Sale environmental assessment. Short-term road closures will prevent public recreation use of
parts of the area during timber sale operations. Obliteration of nonhistoric nonsystem roads, maintenance of existing
system roads and trails, watershed improvement projects, and study and management of the proposed National Register
District will continue as part of ongoing programs.
The ``salvage only'' alternative harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over
approximately 6,600 acres. No green tree thinning will occur. Removal of about 30 MMBF of both merchantable and unmerchantable
material is anticipated. This alternative includes all components of the proposed action, except when modified
as described: (1) While treatment of activity fuels will occur, only limited use of prescribed fire as a management
tool is proposed, in selected areas, such as for use as a fuelbreak near urban areas; (2) site preparation and planting
will occur on high value areas only (such as at the beaches and along roadway corridors) and natural regeneration only
will occur in general forest zones; and (3) only temporary roads and landings used as part of the project will be obliterated.

The fourth alternative emphasizes helicopter harvesting in areas with significant heritage resources. It harvests
dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately 6,750 acres_with approximately
550 acres less tractor logging than alternatives two or three. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands
only within those areas entered for salvage activities. Removal of 30 to 35 MMBF of both merchantable and unmerchantable
material is anticipated. This alternative includes all components of the proposed action, except when modified
as described: (1) While treatment of activity fuels will occur, only limited use of prescribed fire as a management
tool is proposed, in selected areas, such as for use as a fuelbreak near urban areas.

Implementation of this project requires a permit from the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA). It is in a classification
of actions requiring TRPA Governing Board review and approval. Additionally, encroachment permits from the Nevada
Department of Transportation are required for project implementation. Consultation with the Nevada State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) in accordance with the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 

et seq.

) is required. Concurrence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is needed if the Forest Service Biological Assessment
results in a ``may affect'' determination.


The decision on this analysis, pursuant to NEPA, is made by Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit Forest Supervisor, Robert
Harris, as the Forest Service is the lead agency under NEPA. There is no other joint lead agency and no cooperating agencies
under NEPA.


The draft EIS is anticipated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and made available to the public
for comment in February of 1994. The final EIS and its Record of Decision is expected in May of 1994. The decision will
be appealable under Forest Service regulations found at 36 CFR part 215.

The comment period for the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the 

Federal Register

. The public will also be informed of the availability of the DEIS by news releases issued to the media in the Lake Tahoe
region. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most
helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or
the merits of the alternatives discussed (see the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3).

In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft EIS' must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers' position
and contentions.

<DOCTITLE>Restoration Plan for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Area, Prince William Sound, Gulf of Alaska, and Alaska Peninsula,
AK</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revised notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473-12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Department of Agriculture,
Forest Service published a Notice of Intent to prepare a programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the
development of a Restoration Plan following the March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill. This notice revises the dates
for completion of the Draft and Final EIS and provides more information on the proposed action. The responsible official
for the preparation of the EIS is the Regional Forester, Michael A. Barton. The Restoration Plan will establish management
direction and guide all natural resource restoration activities covered by the civil settlement to the Exxon Valdez
oil spill.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Introduction



On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal governments and Exxon under
which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal
Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore
to their pre-spill condition the natural resources and the services they provide, that were injured by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resource injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided
by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services.
Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources,
and acquisition of equivalent resources and services.


All decisions about restoration and uses of restoration funds are determined by six natural resources Trustees,
three Federal and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and of the Interior.
The three State Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game and Environmental Conservation, and the Attorney
General. A Trustee Council, located in Alaska, which is made up of designees of the Federal Trustees and the three State
Trustees, is responsible for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, uses of the restoration funds, and
all restoration activities including the preparation of a Restoration Plan.

On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473-12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Forest Service published
a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS on the Restoration Plan. Since then the Trustee Council has developed a draft Restoration
Plan which has become the proposed action for the analysis to be conducted in the EIS.



B. Draft Restoration Plan



The proposed action (Draft Restoration Plan) consists of nine policy statements, a discussion of categories of restoration
actions and broad objectives for injured resources. The policies for identifying and conducting restoration actions
are:

1. The restoration program will take an ecosystem approach.

2. Restoration activities may be considered for any injured resource or service.

3. Most restoration activities will occur within the spill area. However, restoration activities outside the spill
are, but within Alaska, may be considered when the most effective restoration actions for an injured migratory population
are in a part of its range outside the spill area or when the information acquired from research and monitoring activities
outside the spill area will be important for restoration or understanding injuries within the spill area.

4. Restoration activities will emphasize resources and services that have not recovered. Resources and service
will be enhanced, as appropriate, to promote restoration. Restoration projects should not adversely affect the
ecosystem.

5. Projects designed to restore or enhance an injured service must have a sufficient relationship to an injured resource;
must benefit the same user group that was injured; and, should be compatible with the character and public uses of the
area.

6. Competitive proposals for restoration projects will be encouraged.

7. Restoration projects will be subject to independent scientific review before Trustee Council approval.

8. Meaningful public participation in restoration decisions will be actively solicited.

9. Government agencies will be funded only for restoration work that they do not normally conduct.

Four types of restoration actions are identified and discussed in the Draft Restoration Plan: General restoration,
habitat protection and acquisition, monitoring and research, and public information and administration. Alternatives
to the proposed action will place different emphases on each of these categories of restoration actions.

General Restoration consists of activities that fall within manipulation of the environment, management of human
use for reduction of marine pollution. Decisions about conducting general restoration projects would look at the
following factors: Extent of natural recovery, the value of an injured resource to the ecosystem and to the public,
the duration of benefits, the technical feasibility of the project, the likelihood of success, the relationship
of costs to expected benefits, potential for harmful side effects, benefits to more than one resource, effects on
health and human safety, consistency with applicable laws, and policies, and duplication with other actions.

Habitat Protection and Acquisition is a category that includes purchase of private land or interests in land such
as conservation easements, mineral rights, or timber rights. It also includes recommendations for changing public
agency management practices. Specific policies that relate to habitat protection and acquisition are proposed.
These policies deal with ranking potential lands to determine potential benefits, the need for a willing seller,
purchasing at fair market value, post acquisition management of the acquired lands and involving the public in the
prioritization process.

Monitoring and Research consists of recovery monitoring, restoration monitoring and ecological monitoring and
research. Specific policies governing the selecting and performance of monitoring activities are discussed in
the Draft Restoration Plan.

Public Information and Administration is the last category of restoration actions. It consists of all necessary
administrative actions that are not attributable to a particular project. The Draft Restoration Plan goal for this
category is for administrative costs to average no more than 5 percent of overall restoration expenditures for the
remainder of the settlement period.

General restoration objectives have been developed for resources that are recovering, resources not recovering,
resources where the recovery is unknown, resources such as archaeological resources and wilderness, and services.
These broad objectives will guide in the development of annual work plans.

Further information regarding the proposed action and possible restoration alternatives is included in the Exxon
Valdez Oil Spill Restoration, Volume I: Restoration Framework, April, 1992; the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration
Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, April 1993; the Supplement to Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration
Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, June 1993; the Summary of Public Comment on Alternatives of the
Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, September 1993; and the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan,
November 1993. Copies of these documents may be required from the Oil Spill Public Information Office, 645 G. Street,
Anchorage, Alaska, 99501. Phone number 907 278-8008 or within Alaska 800 478-7745, outside Alaska 800
283-7745.



C. Scoping and Issue Development



With publication of this Revised Notice of Intent, the Trustees are continuing a process intended to identify those
issues that need to be addressed in preparing the Draft EIS (DEIS). Under the National Environmental Policy Act, this
process is called ``scoping.'' Two rounds of public meetings have been held within the spill area soliciting comments
on development of the Draft Restoration Plan. The results of the scoping to date have guided the preparation of the
Draft Restoration Plan. During the scoping process for development of the proposed action the Trustees obtained
information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations
interested in, or affected by restoration. Several of the documents referenced above provide summaries of public
comments received to date.

Further scoping is being conducted to identify the issues to be addressed in the EIS and the range of alternatives that
will need to be developed and analyzed. In addition to publishing this Revised Notice of Intent, interested and affected
people within the spill area will be contacted through the news media. The Public Advisory Group will also be contacted
soliciting comments.



D. Expected Time for Completion



A DEIS should be filed with EPA by mid June 1994 and the final EIS should be filed in late October 1994. The Trustees will
consider the comments, responses, disclosure of environmental consequences, and applicable laws, regulations
and policies in making decisions regarding restoration.



E. Comments



The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments
on the DEIS statement should be as specific as possible, and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits
of the alternatives discussed. (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).

In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of DEIS statements must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position
and concerns.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
impacts of a proposal to harvest timber and construct and reconstruct roads in the Zulu and Can Creek and South Fork
of the Yaak River drainages located about 18 air miles northeast of Troy, Montana. This EIS will tier to the Kootenai
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and EIS, which provide overall guidance for achieving the desired
forest condition of the area. The purpose of the proposed action is to harvest dead, dying or high risk (to mountain
pine beetle infestation) stands of lodgepole pine to reduce potential excessive future natural fuel loadings, increase
the health and productivity of stands that are currently declining in vigor and provide a more balanced distribution
of timber age classes in the Project Area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The timber management activities under consideration would occur within a 13,234 acre analysis area which includes
8,000 acres of Inventoried Roadless Area X166, Pink Mountain (6,400 acres), and portion of 684, Roderick (approximately
1,600 acres).



The proposed action would harvest about 7.2 million board feet from 15 harvest units totalling 706 acres. Approximately
six miles of new specified road would be constructed and 2 miles of existing road would be reconstructed. Approximately
1.5 miles of temporary road would be required and approximately .6 miles of constructed skid trail. With this proposed
action, a portion of the roadless areas may be affected.

There are a variety of purposes for timber harvest and reforestation in the South Fork Yaak area; the primary purposes
are: (1) To improve timber productivity by replacing stands of dead dying or high risk lodgepole pine with younger,
more vigorously growing trees; (2) to salvage the dead and lodgepole pine; (3) to reduce potentially future catastrophic
wildfire conditions by removal of natural dead or dying fuels; and (4) to increase the overall health and vigor of other
stands being considered for management. Additionally, the purpose of road construction and reconstruction is to
facilitate access to the timber stands to be harvested.

The project area consists of approximately 13,234 acres located in Sections 2-11, 4-22, 28-30,
T34N, R31W; Sections 1, 12, 13, 24, 25, T34N, R32W; Sections 29-34, T35N, R31W; and Section 36, T35N, R32W; P.M.M.,
Lincoln County, Montana.

The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the South Fork Yaak River Project Area to: (a) Increase
timber health and productivity and contribute to the Forest's sustained yield of timber products, (b) reduce natural
fuel loadings of dead and dying lodgepole pine as a result of past and potential mountain pine beetle infestations,
(c) dispose of slash and reforest harvested lands, (d) develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of
timber, reforest stands and maintain or improve wildlife security and (e) create a situation of better age class distributions
of stands within project area.

The Kootenai Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The areas of proposed timber harvest
and reforestation would occur within Management Areas 12, 15, 17 and 14. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable
timber land. Road construction and reconstruction would occur in these four management areas. Below is a brief description
of the applicable management direction.

Management Area 12_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that big game summer habitat objectives are met.

Management Area 14_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that grizzly bear habitat objectives are met.

Management Area 15_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest.

Management Area 17_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, viewing
objectives are met.

The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities will be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations
for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource
values.

The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and projected activities on National Forest Lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis of site-specific
mitigation measures and their effectiveness.


Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7)
which has already occurred in December of 1991. In addition, the public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service
officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information,
comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be
interested in or affected by the proposed action. No public meetings are scheduled at this time.


Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be
used to:


1. Identify potential issues.


2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth.


3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as
the Kootenai Forest Plan EIS.


4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action.


5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects).


6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.


Preliminary scoping, including public and agency participation, was initiated in December, 1991, and has continued
through this year. Until recently, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
were envisioned. However, it became apparent to the Interdisciplinary Team that there could be significant effects
on the human environment in Roadless Areas X166 and 684.


The principal environmental issues identified to date are related to:


1. Impacts on the character of the area of Roadless Area 684 and X166.


2. Impacts on fish habitat and other beneficial uses due to potential sediment increase.


3. Impacts on big game security and habitat.


4. Fuels accumulations in terms of potential catastrophic wildfire situations.


Other issues commonly associated with timber harvesting and road construction include: effects on water quality,
cultural resources, soils, old growth, and visuals. This list may be verified, expanded, or modified based on public
scoping for this proposal.


Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been initiated with regard to listed species. The Montana
Department of Health and Welfare-Division of Environmental Quality, Montana Department of Fish and Game, and the
Kootenai Salish Indian Tribe will also be consulted.


While public participation in this analysis is welcome at any time, comments received within 45 days of the publication
of this notice will be especially useful in the preparation of the draft EIS, which is expected to be filed with the EPA
and available for public review in March, 1994. A 45-day comment period will follow publication of a Notice of Availability
of the draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comments received will be analyzed and considered in preparation of a final EIS, which will be accompanied by
a Record of Decision. The final EIS is expected to be filed in June, 1994.


The Forest Service believes it is important at this early stage to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EISs must structure their
participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's
position and contentions 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v.

 NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, 513 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not
raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages Inc. 

v.

 Harris,

 490 F.Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis., 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.


To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
should be as specific as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points.


I am the responsible official for this environmental impact statement.

<DOCTITLE>Boppin Basin Salvage Sale; Kootenai National Forest; Lincoln County, MT</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
impacts of a proposal to harvest timber and construct and reconstruct roads in the East and West Fork of Basin Creek
located about 29 air miles northeast of Troy, Montana. This EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan and EIS, which provide overall guidance for achieving the desired forest condition of the area. The
purpose of the proposed action is to help reduce existing natural fuel loadings of standing and down dead lodgepole
pine, increase the productivity on those suitable areas that sites currently are not growing anywhere near full potential
and increase the health and vigor of proposed salvage stands which will help maintain a more equal distribution of
timber age classes.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The timber salvage management activities under consideration would occur within a 6,046 acre analysis area which
is immediately adjacent to the East and West Fork of Basin Creek.


The proposed action would harvest about 17.6 million board feet from 10 harvest units totaling 1,258 acres. Approximately
4 miles of new road would be constructed and 3 miles of existing road would be reconstructed. 
There are a variety of purposes for timber harvest and reforestation in the Basin Creek area; the primary purposes
are: (1) To improve timber productivity by replacing stands of dead, down or dying lodgepole pine with younger, more
vigorously growing trees; (2) to salvage the dead, down and dying lodgepole pine; and (3) to reduce potentially catastrophic
wildfire conditions by removal of natural dead, down or dying fuels. Additionally, the purpose of road construction
and reconstruction is to facilitate access to the timber stands to be harvested. 
The project area consists of approximately 6,046 acres located in Sections 20-22, 26-29, and 32-34,
T36N, R30N, P.M.M., Lincoln County, Montana. 
The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the Basin Creek Project Area to: (a) Increase timber productivity
and contribute to the Forest's sustained yield of timber products through salvage operations, (b) reduce natural
fuel loadings of dead, down and dying lodgepole pine as a result of past mountain pine beetle infestations, (c) dispose
of slash and reforest harvested lands, (d) develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of timber, reforest
stands and maintain or improve wildlife and (e) create a situation of better age class distributions of stands within
project area. 
The Kootenai Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The areas of proposed timber harvest
and reforestation would occur within Management Areas 12 and 14. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable timber
land. Road construction and reconstruction would occur in these two management areas plus Management Area 13 when
crossing the East Fork of Basin Creek. Below is a brief description of the applicable management direction. 
Management Area 12_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that big game summer habitat objectives are met. 
Management Area 13_These are areas that contain special habitat characteristics which are suitable for old-growth
dependent wildlife. Local road construction is permitted, providing that they are restricted following use to protect
snag characteristics. 
Management Area 14_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that grizzly bear habitat objectives are met. 
The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities will be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations
for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource
values. 
The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and projected activities on National Forest Lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis of site-specific
mitigation measures and their effectiveness. 
Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7)
which has already occurred in March of 1992. In addition, public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials
at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments,
and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested
in or affected by the proposed action. No public meetings are scheduled at this time. Comments from the public and other
agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be used to: 
1. Identify potential issues. 
2. Identify major issues to by analyzed in depth. 
3. Eliminates minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as
the Kootenai Forest Plan EIS. 
4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action. 
5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects). 
6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. 
Preliminary scoping, including public and agency participation, was initiated in March, 1992, and has continued
through this year. Until recently, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
were envisioned. However, it became apparent to the Interdisciplinary Team that due to the size and scope of the proposed
action, that effects on the biological characteristics of the area could be considered significant. In such cases,
an EIS is required. 
The principal environmental issues identified to date are related to: 
1. Wildlife habitat and security maintenance.
2. Fuels treatment and accumulations in terms of potential catastrophic wildfire situations.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from May 1, 1994 to April 30, 1995, is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Las Vegas, Nevada Geographic Service Area.


The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number or points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. The collection of information requirements for this project have
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006. Questions
concerning the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application
kits and applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List commodities and a service to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing
persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 22, November 19, and November 29, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely
Disabled published notices (58 FR 54559, 61072 and 62646) of proposed additions to the Procurement List.



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors,
the Committee has determined that the commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 
51-2.4.

I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environment Impact Statement for the Proposed Coast Rock Products Mining and Reclamation
Plan In and Along the Sisquoc and Santa Maria Rivers in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action is to mine construction-grade aggregate deposits from a seventeen-mile stretch of the Santa
Maria and Sisquoc Rivers, both waters of the United States. The California Division of Mines and Geology has determined
that the most significant concentration of construction-grade aggregate in the region occurs in and just adjacent
to the rivers. This deposit contains material that is important to two counties for the construction, maintenance
and rehabilitation of public and private facilities. The proposed action is intended to help satisfy the long-term
demand for commercially-useable aggregate material in the region.



Because the action will require a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (as amended) and adverse impacts to
the aquatic ecosystem may result, the Corps has determined that the proposed action warrants an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.

A Joint Review Panel (JRP) consisting of the primary permitting agencies for the project has been formed to coordinate
multi-agency review. The JRP includes representatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, California Division
of Mines and Geology, County of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo will serve as co-lead agencies under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental document will therefore be circulated as a joint Environmental
Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Proposed Action



Coast Rock Products, Inc. (Coast Rock), has applied to the Corps of Engineers for a section 404 individual permit to
remove sand and gravel material from a seventeen-mile stretch of the Santa Maria and Sisquoc Rivers over the course
of the next 25 years. In 1989, the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) reported that currently permitted
sources of construction-grade aggregate (classified as MRZ-2 by CDMG) are theoretically sufficient to supply
only 65 percent of the projected aggregate demand in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties (the service area)
over the next 50 years. CDMG further found that the largest concentration of construction-grade material in the service
area extends along these rivers from a narrow canyon in the Sisquoc Ranch to the ancient floodplain underlying the
City of Santa Maria. Because much of this material is no longer accessible due to surface improvements or established
land use, the most viable long-term sources have been identified to occur within and adjacent to the rivers. Thus,
the overall purpose of the proposed action is to mine high-quality, construction-grade aggregate (MRZ-2 classified)
deposits from within the service area for the long-term utilization of the resource (at least the next 25 years) and
reclaim mined lands in accordance with the requirements of the California State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
(SMARA).

In addition to mining sand and gravel, Coast Rock proposes several secondary objectives to the overall project purpose.
These include providing flood protection, enhancing groundwater recharge, reclaiming farm land lost to erosion
and past mining, and establishing wildlife habitat.



2. Alternatives



At least the following alternatives will be considered: (1) No action; (2) applicant's preferred project; (3) off-site
(outside the 100-year floodplain) mining; (4) mining in the river (within the 100-year floodplain) but not within
section 404 jurisdiction; (5) a reduced-scale project; and (6) alternative landuse/reclamation scenarios.



3. Scoping Process



a. Federal, State and local agencies and other interested private citizens and organizations are encouraged to send
their written comments to Mr. Michael Jewell at the address provided. This scoping comments period will expire 45
days from the date of this notice appearing in the 

Federal Register

.

b. Significant issues to be analyzed in depth in the draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) include hydrology/hydraulics,
biological resources, water quality, cultural resources, air quality, transportation, groundwater recharge,
noise, aesthetics, and socioeconomic.

c. Coordination will be undertaken with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
California Department of Fish and Game, State Historic Preservation Office, and California Regional Water Quality
Control Board.

d. As noted above, the project will also undergo review under the California Environmental Quality Act. A draft EIS/EIR
will be published which will discuss both NEPA and CEQA issues.



4. Scoping Meeting



A scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, January 27, 1994 from 1:30 to 4:30 and then again from 6:30 to 8:00 to assess
preliminary issues relative to the Coast Rock Mining and Reclamation Plan. The scoping meeting will be held at the
County Government Center, Board of Supervisors Hearing Room, 511 East Lakeside Parkway, City of Santa Maria, County
of Santa Barbara, California. Participation in the scoping meeting by Federal, State and local agencies, and other
interested private citizens and organizations is encouraged.



5. DEIS Schedule



The current schedule estimates that the DEIS will be available for public review and comment in May 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision: Relocation of the Woodbridge Research Facility Electromagnetic Pulse Simulators</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Availability of record of decision.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This announces the availability of the Record of Decision (ROD) regarding the relocation of the Army's electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) simulators currently located at the Woodbridge Research Facility (WRF), in Woodbridge, Virginia, to
a new location selected from six candidate relocation sites evaluated for the facility. The Army has decided to relocate
its four existing simulators, construct a new simulator, the Vertical EMP Simulator-Second Generation (VEMPS II),
and operate the new facility at the Orogrande Site at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 27, 1989, the Army announced a proposal to relocate the WRF EMP simulators to a new site, citing the following
reasons: The need to continue simulated EMP testing in accordance with Army requirements, the desire to use the economics
of collocation of test operations, and the concern to adjust to the rapidly expanding population in the Woodbridge
and Northern Virginia areas. In 1991, after the Army announced its proposal to relocate the WRF EMP simulators, the
WRF was designated for closure in accordance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (Pub. L. 101-510).
The Army is planning to close the WRF in September 1994. 



As presented in the Final EIS, the Department of the Army's proposed action is to relocate its existing electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) simulators from the Woodbridge Research Facility, Woodbridge, Virginia, construct a new simulator,
the Vertical EMP Simulator II (VEMPS II), and operate them at a site selected from six candidate sites at Army installations
in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. This action entails the dismantling of the existing EMP simulators at the WRF, transporting
the equipment to the selected new site, preparation of the site facilities at the new location and the construction
and operation of the EMP simulators at the new site.

Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1505.2) for implementing the provisions of the National Environmental
Policy Act direct the preparation of a public Record of Decision concerning decisions reached on actions considered
in Environmental Impact Statements. The relocation of the 
WRF EMP simulators to a new location and its potential impacts have been discussed in the final environmental documents
filed with the Environmental Protection Agency, as announced on November 26, 1993 (58 FR, No. 226; p. 62345).

The ROD identifies the Orogrande Site as the site for construction of the new facility and summarizes the alternatives
considered, the basis for selection of this site, and measures that will be undertaken to minimize environmental
effects. This site was both the Army's preferred site and the environmentally preferred site because Orogrande is
the location of the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command Nuclear Effects Directorate, and essentially all Army scientists
and engineers who perform EMP testing are located in this area, thus simplifying logistics for operating the site.
Further, the availability of these technologists and easily accessible operations and maintenance support from
the main post area at WSMR simplifies test support logistics, thereby, minimizing the costs and time required to complete
tests. Additionally, laboratory and administrative space is available at the existing Nuclear Effects Directorate
offices, thereby minimizing the dollar investment to construct the site. The utilization of these spaces also eliminates
the ground disturbance and loss of biological habitat and archeological resources associated with constructing
the administrative staging areas and buildings, the need to construct four miles of security fencing and perimeter
roadways, thus reducing cost and additional loss of biological habitat and archeological resources, and the impact
to biological species. Also the roadways and test areas of the EMP facilities can be sited to avoid archeological resources
and their operation at the Orogrande Site will have the least impact on the operations and facilities at WSMR.

Interested individuals or organizations may obtain copies of the ROD by contacting: U.S. Army Research Laboratory,
Attn: David Davison (AMSRL-CP-S-PA), 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adephi, MD 20783-1145, (301)

Electric Rate Filings Made Between December 22, 1993 and January 3, 1994, Including Amnesty Filings; Notice of Certain
Rate Filings 



January 11, 1994.



The Commission has received 438 rate filings, made under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, during the period December
22, 1993 through January 3, 1994. Many of the filings reflect the submission of multiple agreements for Commission
review. Most of the filings have been made to take advantage of a general amnesty period, announced on July 30, 1993,
for the filing of agreements under which jurisdictional service was being provided as of that date under previously-unfiled
rates, terms and conditions. See Prior Notice and Filing Requirements Under Part II of the Federal Power Act, 64 FERC
  61,139, reh'g denied, 65 FERC   61,081 (1993). 

Attachment A to this notice lists all of these rate filings in chronological and numerical order, starting with filings
made on December 22, 1993. Attachment B to this notice lists all of these filings in alphabetical order, by applicant.


Because of the extremely large number of rate filings made during the period December 22, 1993 through January 3, 1994,
the Commission is unable to issue individual notices of filing for each of the filings made during this period. In order
to ensure issuance of notice of filings at the earliest possible date, and to allow sufficient time for review and response,
the Commission hereby issues this single notice for all of the filings listed in the Attachments.

1

 Any person desiring to inspect a copy of any of the filings may do so during normal business hours in the Commission's
public reference room, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. (Of course, customers to the
filed agreements and, in many cases, affected state commissions already have actual notice of the contents of the
filings by virtue of the Commission's regulations, see 18 CFR 35.2(d)). 





Any person desiring to be heard or to protest any of the enumerated filings should file a motion to intervene or protest
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC. 20426, in accordance
with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211, 385.214. Protests will
be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to any of the proceedings. Any person desiring to become a party must file a motion to intervene. 

Motions or protests in response to filings made from December 22, 1993 through December 27, 1993, as indicated in the
Attachments, should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Motions or protests in response to filings made from December
28, 1993 through December 29, 1993 should be filed on or before January 20, 1994. Motions or protests in response to
filings made from December 30, 1993 through January 3, 1994 should be made on or before January 21, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Appalachian Power Company; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



January 10, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Byllesby-Buck Hydroelectric Project, located on the New River
in Carroll County, Virginia, near the city of Galax, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA). In the
DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project
and has concluded that licensing the project, with appropriate environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. For further information,

<DOCTITLE>NUI Corporation; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. NUI Corporation Pennsylvania & Southern Gas Company



[Docket No. CP94-156-000]



January 5, 1994.



Take notice that on December 22, 1993, NUI Corporation (NUI), 550 Route 202-206, P.O. Box 760, and Pennsylvania
& Southern Gas Company (PSGC), 102 Desmond Street, Sayre, Pennsylvania 18840, filed in Docket No. CP94-156-000
a joint application requesting a certificate pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) permitting NUI
to acquire and operate the jurisdictional facilities of PSGC, abandonment authorization pursuant to Section 7(b)
for PSGC regarding the same facilities, and a service area determination for NUI pursuant to Section 7(f) of the NGA,
all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

NUI proposes to merge with PSGC and acquire certain minor natural gas facilities in New York and Pennsylvania used
by PSGC to transport gas in interstate commerce in conjunction with PSGC's local distribution activities. It is stated
that in order to operate the facilities acquired from PSGC, NUI requests a declaration that it qualifies as a local
distribution company in the service area to be determined for purposes of Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act
(NGPA). NUI also requests a waiver of the regulatory requirements ordinarily applicable to a natural gas company
under the NGA and the NGPA. 

It is stated that the facilities are minor in nature and involve only a few gas consumers along the New York-Pennsylvania
border. It is asserted that NUI does not intend to make any physical modifications to the facilities. 
It is further asserted that the Commission authorizations must be received in order to consummate the transfer of
facilities. 



Comment date: 

January 26, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

2. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company 



[Docket Nos. CP94-151-000 and CP90-1050-002] 



January 6, 1994. 



Take notice that on December 21, 1993, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas
77001, filed an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for authority to abandon by transfer to
its subsidiary, Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), gathering systems located on its West End System
in the states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Panhandle states that, as a result of its compliance with Order No. 636 and the required unbundling of its transportation
and gathering rates together with its customers' elections to cease purchasing natural gas from Panhandle, the utilization
of Panhandle's gathering facilities has declined and is expected to continue to decline. It also indicated that Order
No. 636 has intensified the competition for gathering services in the Anadarko Basin Area where the bulk of Panhandle's
facilities are located. It is alleged that because of its status as a ``natural gas company'' under the provisions
of the Natural Gas Act, Panhandle cannot compete with gatherers that are not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.
Panhandle proposes to transfer its gathering facilities to Field Services which would not be subject to the Commission's
jurisdiction. Panhandle then contends that Field Services could then compete as a gatherer on a more level playing
field with the competition. 

Panhandle states that approval would permit Panhandle to eliminate its existing gathering rates and would result
in a decrease in Field Zone transportation rates. Panhandle also indicates that its customers would not be exposed
to the potential of Order No. 636 transition costs associated with the stranded investment of any gathering facilities
in the future. It is then indicated that, upon transfer of the facilities to Field Services, the facilities would be
operated on a stand-alone, open-access basis. It is also indicated that Field Services would be responsible for all
of the financial, economic, operational and business risks associated with the facilities. 

Panhandle proposes to transfer at net book value 54 distinct gathering systems. Panhandle indicates that as of April
30, 1993, the net book value of the facilities to be transferred was $39,012,101. 

Panhandle also proposes to further amend in Docket No. CP90-1050-002 a pending application filed in Docket
No. CP90-1050-000, 

et al,

 to conform its application to reflect the abandonment of its gathering facilities to Field Services and to update
the list of facilities proposed to be certificated 

nunc pro tunc

 and/or refunctionalized, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection. Panhandle proposes to reduce from 283 to 94 the facilities proposed to be refunctionalized
from gathering to transmission in the application to amend filed in Docket No. CP90-1050-001. Panhandle
also proposes to refunctionalize from gathering to transmission 74 other facilities not previously requested to
be refunctionalized. Panhandle estimates the book value of the facilities proposed to be refunctionalized from
gathering to transmission in the amended application in Docket No. CP90-1050-002 at $4,623,276. 



Comment date:

 January 27, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



3. Panhandle Field Services Company 



[Docket No. CP94-152-000] 



January 6, 1994.

 


Take notice that on December 21, 1993, Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), 5400 Westheimer Court,
Houston, Texas 77056-5310, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-152-000,
requesting that the Commission declare that neither Field Services' proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation
of certain natural gas gathering systems and related facilities presently owned by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company
(Panhandle), Field Services' affiliate, nor any of Field Services' facilities or services would subject Field Services
or any portion of its facilities or services to the jurisdiction of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in
the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<DOCNO> FR940114-2-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-2-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Specifically, Field Services seeks a declaratory order from the Commission finding that: 




(1) Panhandle's West End gathering systems are facilities used for the gathering of natural gas and therefore exempt
from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; 
(2) Field Services would not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2(6) of the Natural Gas Act by virtue of
its proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; 
(3) The gathering services that Field Services seeks to perform as described in the petition would be exempt from the
Commission's jurisdiction under section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; and 
(4) Field Services' rates and charges for gathering services would not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction
pursuant to sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. 




In support of its request, Field Services states that the primary function of the facilities is gathering as defined
under the modified 

Farmland

 test, as set forth in 

Amerada Hess Corporation,

 52 FERC   61,268 (1990), and as exhibited by the size, pressure, length, configuration, and utilization of each
of the gathering systems or groups of gathering systems. It is indicated that each of the 54 gathering systems (1) operates
at low-gathering-line pressure, (2) consists of discrete sections of generally small-diameter pipe, (3) is in a
typical ``spider-web'' or ``rib-like'' gathering configuration in appearance, (4) has wells along its length,
(5) is located behind compression which boosts pressures from low, wellhead pressures so that the gas can enter Panhandle's
mainline transmission system, or (6) is located behind a processing plant. 

Field Services states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panhandle. Field Services describes the facilities
to be transferred as the West End Systems of Panhandle in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Field Services indicates
that these facilities are the subject of Panhandle's companion abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP94-151-000
and Panhandle's application in Docket No. CP90-1050-002 to further amend its pending application in
Docket No. CP90-1050-000, 

et al.

 



Comment date:

 January 27, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Ohio Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (Region 5).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on application of Ohio for full program adequacy determination, public hearing
and public comment period. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste will comply with the revised Federal
Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule
for such determinations. The USEPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which the USEPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal MSWLF
permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of
the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities
and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.
The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs
provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions.
Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved MSWLF permit programs can use the site-specific
flexibility provided by the revised Federal Criteria to the extent the State/Tribe MSWLF permit program allows such
flexibility. The USEPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility,
the revised Federal Criteria apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.


Ohio applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. At the same time, Ohio proposed modifications
to current regulations that will facilitate full approval of its solid waste program. The rules contained in the proposed
revisions to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), Chapter 3745-27, add definitions and requirements that are
no less stringent than portions of the revised Federal Criteria. The specific revised Federal Criteria that Ohio
will incorporate are identified in the Ohio Solid Waste Program Application for U.S. EPA Authorization, October
1993. The USEPA reviewed Ohio's application and has made a tentative determination that the combination of Ohio's
existing MSWLF permit program and the incorporation of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria will be adequate
to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. The Ohio application for program adequacy determination
is available for public review and comment.
The USEPA has also received the proposed revisions to the regulations for review. See 

Proposed Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations, OAC-3745-27

, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), December 23, 1993. Review of the finalized OEPA regulations will
occur prior to the USEPA's final determination of program adequacy. If the OEPA regulations, when fully promulgated
and effective, are essentially unchanged from proposed and are comparable to the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA
may approve the Ohio solid waste program.
Although RCRA does not require USEPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribal MSWLF permit
program, the USEPA Region 5 may schedule an opportunity for a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details
appear below in the ``DATES'' section.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


A. Background


On October 9, 1991, the USEPA promulgated revised Federal Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA,
as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs
to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the revised Federal Criteria. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that the USEPA
determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. To
fulfill these requirements, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.
The USEPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. The USEPA interprets
the requirements for States or Tribes to develop adequate programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to
impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to the revised Federal Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority
to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe
also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, the USEPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator who fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
The USEPA will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined
above. The USEPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule. The USEPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF permit program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF permit program. 
As provided in the revised Federal Criteria, USEPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993.
On October 1, 1993, USEPA published a final ruling which modified the effective date of the landfill criteria for certain
classifications of landfills (58 FR 51536). Thus, for certain small landfills that accept less than 100 tons of waste
per day, the Federal landfill criteria will not be effective until April 9, 1994, instead of October 9, 1993. The exact
classifications of landfills and details on the effective date extensions are contained in the final rule. See 58
FR 51536 (October 1, 1993).



B. State of Ohio


On October 9, 1993, Ohio submitted an application for program adequacy determination. The USEPA has reviewed Ohio's
application and has tentatively determined that the combination of the State's existing permit program and the incorporation
of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria will ensure full compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria.
The Ohio regulations, contained in OAC-3745-27, currently contain the following elements that are considered
equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria:



1. Consideration of other Federal laws (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40
CFR 258.3);
2. Location restrictions for floodplains, fault areas, seismic impact zones, and unstable areas (USEPA approval
is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.11, 258.13, 258.14, and 258.15); 
3. Operating criteria for daily cover material, disease vector control, air criteria, access restrictions, and
liquids restrictions (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.21, 258.22,
258.24, 258.25, and 258.28); 
4. Design criteria (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.40); 
5. Financial assurance criteria for closure, post-closure care, and allowable mechanisms (USEPA approval is for
current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.70, 258.71, 258.72, and 258.74).
In addition, the proposed modifications to the OEPA Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations contain the following
elements that are considered equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria:



1. General requirements and definitions (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable
to 40 CFR 258.1 and 258.2); 
2. Location restrictions for airport safety and wetlands (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements
that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.10 and 258.12);
3. Closure of existing MSWLFs (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR
258.16);
4. Operating criteria for excluding the receipt of hazardous waste, explosive gases control, run-on/run-off control
systems, and surface water requirements (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable
to 40 CFR 258.20, 258.23, 258.26, and 258.27);
5. Recordkeeping requirements (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40
CFR 258.29);
6. Groundwater monitoring applicability, systems, sampling and analysis, detection monitoring program, assessment
monitoring program, assessment of corrective measures, selection of remedy, and implementation requirements
(USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.50, 258.51, 258.53, 258.54,
258.55, 258.56, 258.57, and 258.58); 
7. Closure and post-closure care requirements (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that are comparable
to 
 40 CFR 258.60 and 258.61);
8. Financial assurance criteria for corrective action (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that
are comparable to 40 CFR 258.73). 
The elements of the revised Federal Criteria to be incorporated into the Ohio permit program (1-8 above) are
contained in the proposed regulations currently under promulgation by the OEPA. See 

Proposed Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations, OAC-3745-27

, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, December 23, 1993.
For purposes of implementation of the revised Federal Criteria, Ohio is incorporating a ``unit concept'' into its
current landfill permitting process. Currently, large areas of unprepared land are permitted for a MSWLF facility
as opposed to discrete areas or units prepared for actual waste placement. Landfill owners and operators will be designating
``existing units'' at MSWLF facilities according to a specific procedure and guidelines established by the proposed
OEPA regulations. The procedure involves a clear delineation of the limits of waste placement, design components,
significant boundaries, and what the owner or operator designates as an existing unit or new unit(s) at a MSWLF facility
as of April 1994. The guidelines require that all areas designated as an existing unit are geographically contiguous
and the unfilled areas of the existing unit meet, at a minimum, specific design requirements which are equivalent
to the revised Federal Criteria. The revised OEPA regulations, when effective, will then apply to existing units,
which have been designated by the landfill owner or operator, as well as all new units. 
The revised Federal Criteria require a final cover system with an erosion layer underlain by an infiltration layer
comprised of at least 18 inches of earthen material with a permeability less than or equal to any bottom liner system
or no greater than 10

-5

 cm/sec, whichever is less. Ohio's final cover design allows for a composite liner involving a flexible membrane liner
and a geocomposite clay liner in lieu of 18 inches of recompacted clay. The geocomposite component of the final cover
must be demonstrated to have a permeability less than or equal to 18 inches of recompacted clay with a permeability
of 10

-6

 cm/sec, which exceeds the Federal Criteria. The use of an alternative final cover design to achieve an equivalent
reduction in infiltration is allowed pursuant to 40 CFR 258.60(b).
In addition, the revised Federal Criteria require unfiltered groundwater samples to be used in laboratory analysis.
Currently, Ohio regulations require sampling and analysis procedures which ensure monitoring results that provide
an ``accurate representation'' of groundwater quality. This requirement can be interpreted to require unfiltered
samples. The USEPA intends to revisit this issue during a proposed rulemaking. If the proposed rulemaking upholds
the ban on field filtering, the State will be required to incorporate the provisions of 40 CFR 258.53(b) into its policy
regarding groundwater sampling and analysis procedures. 
The Ohio program will differ from the revised Federal Criteria with respect to the general effective date of the requirements.
The planned effective date of the currently proposed Ohio regulations, which incorporate the Federal Criteria,
is April 1994. The rulemaking process in Ohio is extensive, involving the widespread circulation of draft regulations
to all interested parties, public comment periods and hearings, and legislative review and approval, a process which
takes a minimum of 8 to 12 months. The USEPA understands that State law cannot be retroactive and feels that an effective
date of April 1994 for revised State rules incorporating the Federal Criteria will be adequate. However, as stated
previously, the effective date of the revised Federal Criteria remains October 9, 1993, unless a facility qualifies
for the extension granted to certain small MSWLFs. See 58 FR 51536 (October 1, 1993). All landfill owners and operators
in Ohio were notified directly by USEPA that MSWLFs will be regulated under both existing State rules as well as the
revised Federal Criteria contained in 40 CFR part 258 from October 9, 1993, until the date that the revised Ohio rules
are fully promulgated and effective.
As previously discussed, the USEPA has a final draft of the proposed OEPA regulations. If the OEPA regulations, when
fully promulgated and effective, remain unchanged from proposed and adequately incorporate the revised Federal
Criteria listed above, the USEPA may approve the Ohio solid waste program.
The public may submit written comments on USEPA's tentative determination until March 1, 1994. The USEPA will consider
all public comments on its tentative determination that are received during the public comment period and during
any public hearing, if held. Issues raised by those comments will be the basis for a final determination of adequacy
for Ohio's program. The USEPA will make a final decision on whether or not to fully approve Ohio's program by April 29,
1994, and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the revised Federal Criteria in 
40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As the 
USEPA explained in the preamble to the final revised Federal Criteria, the
USEPA expects that any owner or operator complying with the provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by the USEPA
should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).



Compliance With Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this tentative approval will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This proposed
notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.





Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>


January 7, 1994.


The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-0276. Persons wishing
to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.


OMB Number: 

None.


Title: 

Section 90.673, Modification of EMSP License.


Action: 

New collection.


Respondents: 

Individuals or households, state or local governments, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden: 

6,120 responses; .50 hours average burden per response; 3,060 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses: 

Section 90.673 requires any Expanded Mobile Service Provider (EMSP) to submit, along with any application for modification
of its EMSP license to include new base station facilities, certain information necessary to determine whether the
proposed modification complies with applicable rules. Specifically, the applicant for EMSP license modification
must submit a list of all co-channel facilities and previously filed applications for such facilities, not under
the control of the EMSP licensee, within 113 km of the proposed base station, a description of how the proposed base
station provides protection to these co-channel facilities as required under  90.621(b) or 90.675, and certification
that the proposed station or modification will afford such protection to the other facilities. The request for modification
must include the co-channel stations' call signs, coordinates, effective radiated power and directional antenna
height above average terrain. This data is necessary to ensure that the Commission will not authorize EMSP operations
where they could cause harmful interference to the SMR systems of co-channel licensees. Furthermore, the information
collection will lessen the administrative burdens and delays that would be created if the Commission performed the
engineering analyses that produce this information.





OMB Number: 

None.


Title: 

Section 90.677, Authorization, Construction and Implementation of EMSP Systems.


Action: 

New collection.


Respondents: 

Individuals or households, state or local governments, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response: 

One time filing requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden: 

135 responses; .50 hours average burden per response; 68 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses: 

Section 90.677 requires any Expanded Mobile Service Provider (EMSP) to submit certain information necessary to
determine whether the EMSP has constructed a system that serves 80 percent of the geographic area or 80 percent of the
population in the Rand-McNally Major Trading Area (MTA) covered by the EMSP license. Specifically, the applicant
for EMSP license modification must submit a U.S. Geological Survey map(s) of the MTA, depicting the licensee's authorized
base station sites within the MTA and their respective 40 db contours, a description of how the stations serve the required
land area or population, and an explanation and justification of any alternative method used to calculate contours
aside from the Commission's R6602 F(50,50) curves with a 9 db adjustment. This data is necessary to ensure that licensees
construct and place into operation their authorized channels so as to provide effective service to the public. Furthermore,
the information collection will lessen the administrative burdens that would be created if the Commission required
EMSP licensees, like traditional Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) licensees, to demonstrate efficient use of their
authorized spectrum by submitting information on loading.

SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

. The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of these receivership
estates are insufficient to satisfy all classes of claims, asserted or unasserted against the receivership estate.
Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable state law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution
or payment to any other creditor and therefore the claim of any such creditor is worthless.

<DOCTITLE>Improvements in the Drug Master File System; Notice of a Public Workshop</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public workshop on possible improvements in the drug master
file (DMF) system. The purpose of this workshop is to exchange ideas with interested persons about ways of improving
the drug substance and drug substance intermediate Type II DMF review process.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A DMF is a submission to FDA that may be used to provide confidential, detailed information about facilities, processes,
or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs (see 21 CFR 314.420).
The submission of a DMF is not required by law or FDA regulation. A DMF is submitted solely at the discretion of the holder.
The information contained in the DMF may be used to support an investigational new drug application, a new drug application,
an abbreviated new drug application, another DMF, an export application, or amendments and supplements to any of
these. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) reviews the DMF only when it is referenced in such submissions.



Five types of DMF's exist regarding the following topics: Type I_ manufacturing site, facilities, operating procedures,
and personnel; Type II_drug substance, drug substance intermediate, and material used in their preparation, or
drug product; Type III_packaging material; Type IV_excipient, colorant, flavor, essence, or material used in their
preparation; and Type V_FDA-accepted reference information. 
CDER is considering ways to improve the DMF system, especially Type II DMF's, which often constitute a critical part
of a submission. The workshop will focus on alternative ways for CDER to review Type II DMF's for drug substances and
intermediates. CDER's Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Coordinating Committee has recommended changes
to the DMF review process in a report entitled ``Recommendations for Improvement in FDA's Drug Master File System,''
dated November 2, 1993. The report is available from the Freedom of Information Office (address above) or may be viewed
at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) [Docket No. 90S-0308 (document #M-203)].
A tentative agenda for the public workshop is as follows:
 Morning session, 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
1. FDA presentations:


Recommended review processes for Type II DMF's (drug substances and intermediates)


a. existing DMF system; 
b. suggested improvements to the existing DMF system; 
c. abbreviated antibiotic application model_approval; and
d. Type II DMF ``authorization.'' 
2. Presentations by industry representatives:


Perspectives on the Type II DMF review process and proposals.


3. Presentations by other interested persons/Questions for presenters/ Open discussion 


Approvals/nonapprovals/other_pros/cons.


Afternoon session, 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
1. Overview_Other DMF systems for drug substances and intermediates_foreign models.
a. European Community Drug Substance DMF Format and Content; and
b. Canadian Drug Substance DMF Format and Content.
2. Presentations by other interested persons/Questions for presenters/Open discussion.
A transcript and summary of the workshop will be available from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
approximately 10 days after the workshop at a cost of 10 cents per page.
Interested persons may submit comments on the workshop to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies
of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with
the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

001To permit time for all interested persons to submit data, information, or views on this subject, the docket for
the workshop will remain open until March 14, 1994. Persons who wish to provide additional materials for consideration
should file these materials with the Dockets Management Branch (address above).

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Meetings of Panel</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given of the first meeting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Research Panel,
a panel of special consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), NIH, established to recommend guidelines
for Federal funding of human embryo research. The Panel's first meeting will be held February 2-3, 1994, from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the 2nd, and 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on the 3rd. The meeting will be held at the Bethesda Marriott Hotel,
5151 Pooks Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland. Dates of subsequent Panel meetings will be determined at the first meeting.

Until June 1993, Federal regulations governing research on human subjects (45 CFR part 46) required research involving
in vitro fertilization (IVF) to be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). Because of the absence of an EAB since
1980, Federal funding of IVF protocols was not possible. With the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub.
L. 103-43), the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals was nullified. As a result, IVF proposals,
as well as research involving human embryos that result from IVF or other sources, may now be considered for Federal
funding.

The NIH has received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis.
However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the
NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines
to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. Panel members will be asked to consider various areas
of research involving the human embryo and provide advice as to those areas they view to be acceptable for Federal funding,
areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research
considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will be asked to recommend specific guidelines for the review
and conduct of this research. Ethical issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's
purview. The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review.

The NIH invites public input into this process. Those who wish to share their views about Federal funding of human embryo
research may address the Panel during public comment periods that will be scheduled during each meeting. The public
comment period during the first meeting is scheduled to take place February 2 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Those who wish to address
the Panel at this or subsequent meetings are asked to contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor, by telephoning 301-496-1454
or by sending a facsimile message to 301-402-0280 or 301-402-1759. Oral statements must not
exceed five minutes in length, and opportunities to present statements will be determined by the order in which requests
are received. Those who wish to present oral statements should forward a one-page summary of their remarks in advance
of the scheduled presentation date. Individuals and organizations may also submit written comments of any length
to the Panel. These should be forwarded to the NIH in care of Ms. Schnoor at 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 1, room 218,
Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals
are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed
above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number.
General questions about the Panel or the first meeting should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor.

Future meetings of the Panel will be announced in this publication.

<DOCTITLE>Prospective Grant of Exclusive License: Cell Stress Transcriptional Factors</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application SN 07/617,910, entitled ``Cell Stress Transcriptional
Factors'' to StressTech Biomedical, Inc. of San Francisco, CA. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned
to the United States of America.



The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. It is anticipated that this license will be limited to the fields of commercial screening assay
services and kits provided to third parties. This prospective exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days
from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant
of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

The patent application is based upon the observation that activation of heat shock proteins in an organism indicates
elevated or environmental temperatures or a variety of other environmental stresses. Activation involves binding
of a heat shock factor (HSF) to heat shock elements (HSE) and consequent transcription of heat shock genes. This method
for detecting the accumulation of HSF in the nucleus of stressed cells involves novel activators for 

Drosophilia

 and human HSF, polynucleotides encoding those activators, and antibodies to natural and recombinant DNA. The method
may also be used to monitor and diagnose the effects of abnormal stresses, including disease, on cells.

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Acetaminophen
</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of acetaminophen, which is a widely consumed analgesic found in several nonprescription
pharmaceuticals. 

Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering to both sexes of rats and mice doses
of 0, 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm acetaminophen in feed for 104 weeks. 

Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity 
 of acetaminophen in male F344/N rats that received 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic
activity of acetaminophen in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There
was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of acetaminophen in male and female B6C3F1 mice that received 600, 3,000,
or 6,000 ppm. 





Nonneoplastic lesions associated with exposure to acetaminophen included increased severity of nephropathy and
increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia and parathyroid hyperplasia in male rats, increased severity
of nephropathy in female rats, and increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia in male and female
mice. 

Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O. Box 12233,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541-3419.

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Furan
</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of furan, used primarily as an intermediate in the synthesis and preparation of other organic
compounds and also in the preparation of numerous polymeric compounds used for preparation of temperature-resistant
structural laminates. Copolymers of maleic acid and furan form complexes with alkaline earth ions and are used in
metals, foodstuffs, and machine dishwashing products as alternatives to phosphorus- and nitrogen-containing
detergents. 

Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering to both sexes of rats doses of 0,
2, 4, or 8 mg furan per kg body weight and 0, 8, or 15 mg/kg furan to both sexes of mice in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week
for 2 years. 

Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity
 of furan in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular neoplasms
of the liver and on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity
of furan in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and
benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland. 





Nonneoplastic liver lesions associated with furan administration in rats and mice included biliary tract fibrosis,
hyperplasia, inflammation, and proliferation, as well as hepatocellular cytomegaly, degeneration, hyperplasia,
necrosis, and vacuolization. In rats, increased severity of nephropathy with an associated increased incidence
of parathyroid hyperplasia was associated with exposure to furan. 

The study scientist for this bioassay is Dr. R. D. Irwin. Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be
directed to Dr. Irwin at P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541-3340.

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of o-Nitroanisole</DOCTITLE>




The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of o-nitroanisole which is used as an intermediate for the preparation of o-anisidine and
in the manufacture of azo dyes.


Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by feeding groups of 60 F344 rats of each sex diets containing
0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole and groups of 60 B6C3F1 mice of each sex diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000
ppm o-nitroanisole for 103 weeks. In a companion study, male and female rats were fed 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole
for 6 months and maintained on untreated feed for 11/2 years.

Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity1 of o-nitroanisole
in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 to 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased
incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney,
and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear
cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years.
Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male
and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole
in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some
evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular
adenomas.

Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule
epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal
hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female
rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole.

Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O. Box 12233,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541-3419.

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Pentachloroanisole</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of pentachloroanisole, a chlorinated aromatic compound which is widely distributed at
low levels in the environment and in food products. Formation of pentachloroanisole in the environment may result
from the degradation of structurally related, commercially important, ubiquitous chlorinated aromatic compounds
such as pentachlorophenol and pentachloronitrobenzene which are known rodent toxins or carcinogens.

Two year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering pentachloroanisole in corn oil
by gavage 5 days per week for up to 2 years to groups of 70 male and 70 female rats and mice of each sex. Male rats received
doses of 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of pentachloroanisole; female rats and mice received doses of 0, 20, and 40 mg/kg pentachloroanisole.

Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
 of pentachloroanisole in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal
medulla. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in female F344/N rats based
on marginally increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla. There was some evidence
of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidence of benign pheochromocytomas
of the adrenal medulla and hemangiosarcomas of the liver. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole
in female B6C3F1 mice given doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg.





Pentachloroanisole administration was associated with increased incidences of adrenal medulla hyperplasia in
female rats and increased incidences of pigmentation in the renal tubule epithelium, olfactory epithelium, and
hepatocytes of male and female rats. In addition, decreased incidences of pancreatic adenomas and focal hyperplasia
in male rats and decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenomas and uterine stromal polyps and sarcomas (combined)
in female rats were observed. Hyperthermia-related lesions in male rats receiving 20 or 40 mg/kg were considered
indirectly related to pentachloroanisole administration.

Pentachloroanisole administration was associated with increased incidences of adrenal medulla hyperplasia and
hypertrophy and hepatocellular mixed cell foci in male mice. In male and female mice, nonneoplastic liver lesions
associated with pentachloranisole administration included hepatocellular cytologic alteration, Kupffer cell
pigmentation, biliary tract hyperplasia, and subacute inflammation.

fall chinook salmon run size and harvest, and water needs for fish and farmers. Comments from the public will again
be invited.

At the Council's meeting on February 3, members will hear reports from the Council's Technical Advisory Team on issues
involving incidental salmon harvest in the Pacific whiting fishery and data on the spring chinook salmon harvest.
The Council will also draft a list of tasks to be addressed by the spring chinook salmon workgroup, comment on on-going
issues, and set priorities for salmon harvest management recommendations to be made in 1994. The Council will take
action by adopting a process for identifying high-priority data needs and adopting a meeting schedule and agenda
items for 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Twin Falls County, Idaho has made application to purchase 1083.77 acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), on which they propose to construct, operate and maintain a state of the art ``Subtitle D'' solid
waste facility. The proposed project is located near Hub Butte, 10 miles south of the City of Twin Falls, Idaho. The
purpose of the proposed facility would be to bring Twin Falls County into compliance with the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) and its associated regulations, 40 CFR 257 and 258 ``Subtitle D''. These regulations set forth
many new requirements for solid waste facilities that are in operation after April 9, 1993 that the existing facilities
in Twin Falls County do not meet. The proposed facility would be constructed and administered by Twin Falls County
and would be operated by a private contractor.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Draft Plan Amendment (DEIS/DPA) has been prepared which identifies resource
values and analyzes the environmental impacts to these resource that would be expected from the proposed action.
The DEIS/DPA identifies the preferred alternative, which is the proposed action, and a no action alternative. The
Bureau of Land Management is the lead Federal Agency in the preparation of the TFSWF DEIS/DPA.



Copies of the DEIS/DPA are being sent to all individuals and agencies that have participated in the public scoping
process or have otherwise asked to be included on the mailing list.

Additional copies are available from the Burley District of the Bureau of Land Management, Route 3, Box 1, Burley,

Note: 

Publication of this Notice of Realty Action (NORA) terminates and replaces the NORA published under serial number
UTU-65199 on November 23, 1992, in Vol. 57, No. 220, Pages 53927 & 53928 of the 

Federal Register.




The purpose of the land exchange is to acquire private land located in the Book Cliffs region of southeastern Uintah
County, Utah in exchange for public land. The offered private land, known locally as the Cripple Cowboy Ranch, is needed
to consolidate public land ownership within the Book Cliffs. Acquisition of the offered ranch property will enhance
resource management objectives to preserve crucial Rocky Mountain elk calving areas; protect habitat for mule deer,
black bear, and other wildlife species; improve and protect riparian habitat; enhance native fisheries and provide
for public access and recreational opportunities for future generations in the Book Cliffs region.

The public land will be used to equalize land values for the offered private lands within the Book Cliffs pursuant to
the exchange agreement between RMEF and BLM. The exchange would proceed until such time as the values of the public
and private lands reach full equalization.

In addition to acquiring part of the Cripple Cowboy Ranch via land exchange, riparian lands and associated water rights
for portions of the offered ranch property may be removed from the above described pool of private lands to allow direct
purchase by the United States.

Disposal of the selected public lands would be subject to the following reservations and third party rights:

<DOCTITLE>Chickasaw National Recreation Area; Park Boundary</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Park Service, Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; correction of park boundary.





Public Law 94-235 established Chickasaw National Recreation Area on March 17, 1976. The legislation specified
that the total acreage of the recreation area may not exceed 10,000 acres. On December 9, 1991, a notice of a change in
the boundary was published in the 

Federal Register

, Vol. 56, No. 236, page 64272. This notice revised the boundaries of the area as depicted on a map entitled ``Boundary
Map, Chickasaw National Recreation Area,'' Drawing No. 107/80027, dated April 1991. 
During the process of transferring jurisdiction from the Bureau of Reclamation to the National Park Service in accordance
with the 1965 Memorandum of Agreement, three errors were made in mapping the original boundary and these errors were
perpetuated in subsequent mapping. The three areas requiring correction are described as follows: 
Boundary Area ``A'' is located in the NW1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray County,
Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to exclude 41.16 acres which were never acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation
from H.H. Thomas or C.W. Purtle. This parcel was never intended to be a part of the Arbuckle Reservoir Project according
to the Memorandum of Agreement and the deed records for the project. 
Boundary Area''B-1'' is located in the NE1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray
County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to delete 10.10 acres that were conveyed to Glenn Haines by
the United States of America, as recorded on May 27, 1966, in Book 159, page 619, of the deed records of Murray County,
Oklahoma. 
Boundary Area ``B-2'' is located in the NE1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray
County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to include 10.00 acres that were conveyed to the United States
of America by Glenn Haines and Janetta Haines, as recorded on May 27, 1966, in Book 159, page 617, of the deed records
of Murray County, Oklahoma. 
In summary, one change will add 10.00 acres and 2 changes will delete 51.26 acres, creating a net decrease of 41.26 acres.
With these corrections made to the recreation area boundary, the current total acreage is 9,888.83. The authority
for implementing this action is Public Law 94-235 (90 Stat. 235.) 
Therefore, notice is hereby given that the boundary of Chickasaw National Recreation Area should be revised as described
above and delineated on a map entitled ``Boundary Map, Chickasaw National Recreation Area,'' numbered 107/80,030
and dated January 1993. This map is on file and available for inspection in the Office of the National Park Service,
Department of the Interior, the Office of the Southwest Region, National Park Service, and the Office of the Superintendent,
Chickasaw National Recreation Area.

AGENCY: 

Bureau of Reclamation, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the draft environmental impact statement/draft environmental impact report: INT DES-94-03.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and section 21002 of the
California Environmental Quality Act, Reclamation and the Coachella Valley Water District (Coachella) have issued
a joint draft environmental impact statement/draft environmental impact report (DEIS/DEIR) on a proposed canal
lining project. The project involves lining the remaining unlined sections of the 70-foot-wide Coachella Canal
between Siphons 7 and 14, and Siphons 15 and 32, while the canal continues to deliver irrigation water. The canal, which
delivers Colorado River water to Coachella, lies in Riverside and Imperial Counties. The preferred alternative
in the DEIS/DEIR is to line the existing canal while diverting the waterflow around the construction area by temporary
pipes.




Public Law 100-675 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to allow lining the unlined sections
of canal in order to make the conserved water available in California. No Federal funds have been authorized for the
project. In accordance with Public Law 100-675, Coachella and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California may provide non-Federal funding for the project under contract with the Secretary. Lining the canal would
reduce seepage by approximately 31,000 acre-feet per year.

Mitigation of impacts to wetlands habitat could require approximately 5,000 acre-feet per year from the canal, resulting
in a net amount of approximately 26,000 acre-feet of conserved water per year.

<DOCTITLE>Patrick D. Broe_Continuance in Control Exemption_Central Kansas Railway, Limited Liability Co.</DOCTITLE>



Patrick D. Broe (Mr. Broe), a noncarrier, has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Central Kansas Railway,
Limited Liability Company (CKRLLC), upon CKRLLC's becoming a rail carrier. 

CKRLLC, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32430, Central Kansas Railway,
Limited Liability Company_Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Central Kansas Railway, Inc., and Certain Incidental
Line Segments of The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company and Burlington Northern Railroad Company, to acquire
and operate: (1) All of the rail lines of Central Kansas Railway, Inc. (CKR), located in Kansas and Oklahoma; (2) two
rail lines in Kansas from The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe); (3) one rail line in Kansas from
the Burlington Northern Railroad Company; and (4) incidental trackage rights over six segments of track owned by
Santa Fe, one segment of track owned by Union Pacific Railroad Company, one segment of track owned by Missouri Pacific
Railroad Company, and one segment of track owned by St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company. The parties intended
to consummate that transaction on December 28, 1993, or later. 

Mr. Broe is a noncarrier individual who will directly control CKRLLC upon its becoming a carrier. Mr. Broe also directly
controls Panhandle Northern Railroad Company (exempted in Finance Docket No. 32377), The Broe Companies, Inc.,
a holding company that directly controls CKR, and noncarriers Great Western Railway Company (Great Western) and
Railco, Inc. (Railco). Great Western directly controls rail carriers, Great Western Railway of Colorado, Inc.,
Great Western Railway Company of Iowa, Inc., and Great Western Railway of Oregon, Inc. Railco controls noncarrier
Chicago West Pullman Transportation Company, which in turn, controls six class III railroads: Chicago West Pullman
& Southern Railroad Company, Georgia Woodlands Railroad Company, Newburgh & South Shore Railroad Company,
Chicago Rail Link, Manufacturers' Junction Railway Company, and Kansas Southwestern Railway Company. The existing
common control relationship among these carriers is discussed in Finance Docket No. 32362. 

This is a transaction within a corporate family of the type specifically exempted from prior review and approval under
49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). It will not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or
a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family. The purpose of this transaction is
to have the assets of CKR transferred to CKRLLC, a limited liability corporation, for estate planning purposes. 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Karl Morell,
Taylor, Morell & Gitomer, suite 210, 919 18th St., NW., Washington, DC 20006. 







Decided: 

January 6, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Consolidated Rail Corporation_Abandonment_Between Warsaw </DOCTITLE>
and Valparaiso, in Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke, La Porte and 
Porter Counties, IN 



The Commission has found that the public convenience and necessity permit Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail),
to abandon its 61-mile rail line known as the Fort Wayne Line, from milepost 363.0 near Warsaw to milepost 424.0 near
Valparaiso, in Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke, La Porte and Porter Counties, IN. 
A certificate will be issued authorizing abandonment unless within 15 days after publication of this notice the Commission
finds that: (1) A financially responsible person has offered financial assistance (through subsidy or purchase)
to enable rail service to continue; and (2) it is likely that such assistance would fully compensate Conrail. 
Requests for public use conditions must be filed with the Commission and Conrail within 10 days after publication.

Any offers of financial assistance must be filed with the Commission and Conrail no later than 10 days from the date
of publication of this Notice. The following notation must be typed in bold face on the lower left-hand corner of the
envelope containing the offer: ``Section of Legal Counsel, AB-OFA''. Any offer previously made must be remade within
this 10-day period. 

Information and procedures regarding financial assistance for continued rail service are contained in 49 U.S.C.
10905 and 49 CFR 1152.27. Requests for public use conditions must conform with 49 CFR 1152.28(a)(2). 






Decided: 

December 21, 1993.

<DOCTITLE>Peter A. Gilbertson, Et al._Continuance in Control Exemption_Louisville & Indiana Railroad Co.</DOCTITLE>



Peter A. Gilbertson, H. Terry Hearst, Bruce A. Lieberman, R. Lawrence McCaffrey, Jr., and Harold F. Parmly, noncarrier
individuals, have filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Louisville & Indiana Railroad Company
(LIRC) when it becomes a carrier. 

LIRC concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Louisville & I. R. Co._Acq. and Oper. Exemp._Consolidated Rail
Corp., Finance Docket No. 32440, to acquire and operate approximately 115 miles of rail line owned by Consolidated
Rail Corporation in Indiana and Kentucky. LIRC expects to consummate the transaction on or about March 12, 1994. 

Four of the filing parties are officers or directors of the Chicago, SouthShore & South Bend Railroad (CSS), a
class III rail carrier operating in Indiana and Illinois. All are minority shareholders in CSS's corporate general
partner, SouthShore Corporation (a noncarrier), and three are officers and directors of that entity as well. The
parties state that: (1) The railroads will not connect with each other or with any railroads in their corporate family;
(2) the continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads
with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier.
The transaction is therefore exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).

<DOCTITLE>Summit View Corp._Continuance in Control Exemption_The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Co.</DOCTITLE>



Summit View Corporation (Summit), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control
of the Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company (WTRM), upon WTRM becoming a class III rail carrier. 

WTRM has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company_Operation Exemption_Rail
Line in Trumbull County, OH, Finance Docket No. 32438, to operate over 5.28 miles of rail line under contract with the
Mahoning Valley Economic Development Rail Corporation (EDRC). The parties intend to consummate the transaction
on or soon after the effective date of the exemption. 

Summit controls three other nonconnecting class III rail carriers operating in Ohio: Ohio Central Railroad, Inc.,
Ohio Southern Railroad, Inc. and the Youngstown & Austintown Railroad, Inc. 

Summit states that: (1) The properties operated by these four carriers do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance
in control is not a part of a series of transactions that would connect the four railroads with each other or any other
railroad currently controlled by Summit; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the
transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed by with the Commission and served on: Kelvin
J. Dowd, Esq., Slover & Loftus, 1224 Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036.

The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Co._Operation Exemption_Rail Line in Trumbull County, OH 

Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company (WTRM), a noncarrier, has filed a notice of exemption to operate over 5.28
miles of rail line between milepost 89.10 at Deforest Junction, OH and milepost 94.38 at North Warren, OH, under a contract
with the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Rail Corporation (EDRC). The parties intend to consummate the transaction
on or soon after the effective date of the exemption. 

The subject line, currently owned by CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), was approved for abandonment by the Commission
in CSX Transportation, Inc._Abandonment_Between Deforest Junction and North Warren in Trumbull County, OH, Docket

will purchase the line from CSXT prior to WTRM's commencement of rail carrier service. WTRM will operate over the line
as a common carrier by rail serving shippers local to the line, and will interchange traffic with CSXT at Deforest Junction.


The transaction is related to a notice of exemption concurrently filed in Summit View Corporation_Continuance in
Control Exemption_The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company, Finance Docket No. 32439 wherein Summit View Corporation
(Summit) seeks to continue in control of WTRM and three other class III railroads upon WTRM becoming a class III rail

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein. 

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. 

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. 

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics. 

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Penetrators, Inc., Midland and Houston, Texas; Negative Determination on Reconsideration



On December 13, 1993, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68440).

The former workers stated that the workers produced crude oil and natural gas and should be certified.

New findings on reconsideration show that the workers perform downhole drilling and stimulation services to rejuvenate
new and existing oil wells. These services are provided to unaffiliated production firms in the oil and gas industry.
The predominate portion of their services is performed on old wells. Only a small portion of their work is performed
on new wells. Accordingly, the workers do not meet the on-site requirements for drilling exploration services necessary
for a worker group certification.

Further, the price of oil is not a worker group eligibility criterion for certification under the Trade Act of 1974.
Accordingly, a decline in the price of crude oil, in itself, would not form a basis for a worker group certification.

The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by increased imports but
only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like or directly
competitive products which contributed importantly to declines in sales or production and employment.



Conclusion



After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for adjustment
assistance to workers and former workers of Penetrators, Inc., in Midland, Texas and Houston, Texas.

The notice will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

.

Investigation findings show that the company submitted corporate sales and production data instead of data for the
Southern District of Plains Petroleum Operating Company in Midland, Texas.

The new findings on reconsideration show that crude oil and natural gas sales and production decreased in the 12 month
period ending in July 1993 compared to the same period in 1992.

Other findings on reconsideration show substantial worker separations in 1993.

U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased in 1992 compared to 1991 and in the first six months of 1993 compared
to the same period in 1992.

The Department's survey showed major customers reducing their purchases of crude oil from the Midland facility and
increasing their purchases of imported crude oil.



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration it is concluded that increased imports
of articles like or directly competitive with the production of crude oil and natural gas in the Southern District
of Plains Petroleum Operating Company in Midland, Texas contributed importantly to the total or partial separation
of workers at the Plains Petroleum Operating Company. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I
make the following revised determination:




All workers of the Plains Petroleum Operating Company Southern District, in Midland, Texas who became totally or
partially separated from employment on or after August 3, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under
section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






North Atlantic Energy Service Corp.; Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1; Order Approving Transfer of License



I



Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative, Inc., (Vermont) is the holder of a 0.41259-percent ownership
share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is governed by License No.
NPF-86 issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC) pursuant to 10 CFR part 50 on March 15, 1990,
in Docket No. 50-443. Under this license, only North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (North Atlantic),
acting as agent and representative of 12 joint owners listed in the license, has the authority to operate Seabrook
Station, Unit No. 1. Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.



II



By letter dated August 27, 1993, North Atlantic proposed an amendment to License No. NPF-86 which would change
the license to reflect the transfer of Vermont's 0.41259-percent ownership share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1,
to North Atlantic Energy Corporation (NAEC).

In 1990, Vermont filed a claim against Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) with the United States Bankruptcy
Court which was then hearing a petition from PSNH for reorganization under Chapter II of the United States Bankruptcy
Code. Vermont's claim sought redress for damages that were alleged to have been incurred while PSNH had been the managing
agent for the Seabrook Station. In November 1990, the two parties reached a settlement which included an agreement
by PSNH or its designee to purchase Vermont's share of the Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, subject to obtaining the necessary
approvals from all regulatory agencies. In December 1990, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the stipulation
that PSNH and Vermont had filed describing the settlement.

In June 1992, in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization for PSNH that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Northeast
Utilities (NU) acquired PSNH in merger transactions and, after receipt of NRC approval, NAEC (a weekly formed and
wholly owned subsidiary of NU) acquired PSNH's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. The transfer of Vermont's
ownership share in Seabrook to NAEC will consummate the settlement entered into by Vermont and PSNH.

The transfer of rights under License No. NPF-86 is subject to the NRC's approval under 10 CFR 50.80(a). After
reviewing information submitted in the August 27, 1993, letter and other information before the Commission, the
NRC staff has determined that the transfer of Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1 to NAEC (which is already
a licensee) does not affect NAEC's technical or financial qualifications to be a holder of License No. NPF-86,
and the license transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued
by the Commission.



III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, 51.32, and 51.35, an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 605). Accordingly, based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has determined
that issuance of this order will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 161b and 161i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended), 42 U.S.C. 2201, and 10
CFR 50.80, 

it is hereby ordered 

that the transfer of control of Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative, Inc.'s 0.41259-percent
undivided ownership interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, to North Atlantic Energy Corporation is approved subject
to the following: (1) Should the transfer not be completed by May 30, 1994, this Order will be null and void and (2) on
application and for good cause shown, this Order may be extended for a short period beyond May 30, 1994.




Dated at Rockville, MD, this 7th day of January 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant seeks an order declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.





Applicant's Representations




1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust.
On January 15, 1992, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(1) of the Act and a registration
statement under section 8(b) of the Act and under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared
effective on April 13, 1982, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that date.





2. On June 14, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved, subject to shareholder approval, an Agreement and Plan
or Reorganization and Liquidation (the ``Reorganization'') providing for the transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of applicant to Gradison Cash Reserves Trust (the ``Acquiring Fund'') in exchange
for shares of the Gradison-McDonald U.S. Government Reserves Series of Gradison Cash Reserves Trust (``GM-US
Shares'') and the assumption of liabilities. According to a registration statement filed by the Acquiring Fund on
July 1, 1993, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, the Board of Trustees of applicant, including the trustees
who are not ``interested persons'' of applicant as that term is defined in the Act, concluded that the Reorganization
would be in the best interests of the shareholders of applicant, and that the interests of applicant's shareholders
would not be diluted as a result.


3. The registration statement on Form N-14 and the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein was furnished
to applicant's shareholders on or about August 15, 1993. At a special meeting of shareholders held on September 15,
1993, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the Reorganization.




4. On September 24, 1993, 24,964,000 shares of applicant were outstanding at a net asset value of $1.00 per share. At
such date, aggregate net assets of applicant were $24,964,000. As of September 24, 1993, GM-US Shares were distributed
to applicant's shareholders. Each shareholder received the proportion of GM-US Shares received by applicant
that the number of applicant shares owned by each such shareholder bore to the number of outstanding applicant shares.


5. Applicant's investment adviser paid expenses incurred in the reorganization totalling $54,222.


6. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement; Asotin County, WA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Recission of notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that, based on environmental studies and comments received during
the scoping process and public information meetings for the proposed project, it has been decided to prepare an Environmental
Assessment (EA) in lieu of an Environmental Impact Statement. The Notice of Intent which appeared in the 

Federal Register

 /Vol. 58, No. 149/Thursday, August 5, 1993, regarding a proposed highway project in Asotin County, Washington, is
hereby rescinded.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

An EA for the proposed project was approved for circulation on December 28, 1993. Subsequent distribution included
State and Federal agencies and interested parties identified during project planning and scoping. The EA discusses
a proposal (build alternative) to construct a new 1.1 mile Fleshman Way roadway on a route north of 16th Avenue in Asotin
County, Washington. The proposed improvements would also involve the reconstruction of the existing 15th Street
between 16th Avenue and Bridge Street (U.S. Highway 12) for a distance of about 1.5 miles. It would also include a new
interchange or intersection in the vicinity of 13th Street and a new intersection on 16th Avenue and Fleshman Way.




Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to address existing traffic operations problems, to meet
projected traffic demand and to improve safety. Existing deficient features include lane and shoulder widths, horizontal
and vertical alignments, and pavement structure. The proposed project is included in the Asotin County and the City
of Clarkston Comprehensive Plans as a link between U.S. Highway 12 west of Clarkston and the Southway Bridge, and provides
a southern connection between the Cities of Clarkston and Lewiston.

Several alternatives were evaluated as part of the environmental studies conducted for the project. However, only
one build alternative and the no-build are under consideration at present. The build alternative includes a four-lane
roadway on a new location, generally north of 16th Avenue, as described above, and intersecting 15th Street south
of Highland Avenue. It also includes widening 15th Street to three lanes (two travel lanes and a continuous left-turn
lane).

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments, have been sent to appropriate Federal, State, and
local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest
in the proposal. A series of public meetings were held in Asotin County between January and August 1993. A public hearing
has been scheduled for January 27, 1994. The EA is currently available for review and comments.

Comments on the EA and the proposed action will be accepted until ten days after the public hearing. To ensure that the
full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and any significant issues identified, comments
and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action
and the EA should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Contra Costa County and Solano County, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that a supplement to a Draft Environmental Impact Statement will
be prepared for a proposed highway project in Contra Costa County and Solano County, California.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), will prepare a supplement
to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on a proposal to construct a new toll bridge across the Carquinez
Strait at Interstate 680 between the City of Benicia and the City of Martinez. The proposed new toll bridge will be parallel
to the existing Benicia-Martinez Bridge. The original DEIS for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge System (FHWA-CA-EIS-91-03-D)
was approved October 17, 1991. The proposed improvements will provide a new five-lane bridge, including one auxiliary
lane and one slow-vehicle lane, a new toll plaza and new freeway-to-freeway connectors between I-680 and I-780.
These are considered necessary to improve operation and safety, relieve freeway congestion and accommodate projected
traffic volumes.




The proposed project limits include I-680, from 2000 feet south of the Marina Vista Interchange in Contra Costa
County to Bayshore Road in Solano County, and I-780, from East 5th Street to include the I-680/I-780
Interchange in Solano County. The scope of the traffic study includes: (1) I-680 from Route 4 to I-80, (2)
I-780 between I-680 and I-80, (3) I-80 between Red Top Road and the Route 12 East Interchange,
(4) Freeway-to-freeway as well as local interchanges, and (5) Freeway ramp-end and local street intersections potentially
affected by proposed improvements. Modifications to the I-680/Marina Vista Interchange and the I-680/I-780
Interchange will be required, and will be considered in the preliminary engineering and environmental studies.


A Draft EIR/EIS for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge System Project was circulated and a public hearing was held in December
1991. One hundred thirty (130) written comments were received. Substantial comments involved: (1) Matching the
scope of the project with the available funding, (2) providing for future rail transit on the new bridge, (3) location
of the new bridge and toll plaza, (4) the direction of toll collection, and (5) construction impacts. Based on this
information the decision was made to down-scope the project to the current proposal and prepare a Supplemental Draft
Environmental Impact Statement.

Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Taking no action, (2) providing for mass transit and (3) providing
for multi-modal transportation modes including bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Incorporated into the studies
with the build alternatives will be design variations of grade and alignment.
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in
this proposal. A public meeting (open house/map display) will be held to provide information and discuss features
of the project. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meeting
and hearing. The Supplemental Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public
hearing. No formal scoping meeting will be held.
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are
identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning
this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address previously provided in this document.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared
for a proposed highway project located in Johnson County, Kansas, Cass County, Missouri, and Jackson County, Missouri.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Kansas Department of Transportation, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department,
Cass County, and Johnson County will prepare an EIS for a proposed highway project known as the 21st Century Transportation
Corridor. If constructed, the project would be primarily on new location and developed initially as a two-lane road
(ultimately as a four-lane roadway). The study corridor begins at the existing K-7/Shawnee Mission Parkway
interchange, passes to the east side of DeSoto, extends southerly along the west side of the Cedar Creek development
and the Johnson County Industrial Airport, extends southeasterly to U.S. 169 north of Spring Hill, and then extends
easterly across the southern part of Johnson County passing south of Stilwell and intersecting the State Line in the
vicinity of 195th Street. The corridor will then enter Cass County, Missouri, and connect with Highway 71 south of
Belton; a distance of approximately 74 kilometers (46 miles).



The project is intended to provide relief for projected traffic demands in western and southern Johnson County, Kansas,
northern Cass County, Missouri, and southern Jackson County, Missouri. Several alternatives will be considered
including the no build. Also incorporated into the study will be various alignments within the corridor.

One public information and two 

Citizen's Group

 meetings have been held to keep the local citizens informed of the study. These meetings have provided early coordination
with appropriate Federal, State, local agencies, and private organizations who have expressed interest in this
proposed project.

Public hearing(s) will be held during the development of the EIS. Public notice will be given for the time and place
of the hearing(s) and the location of where the Draft EIS will be available for review and comment.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA, Johnson County, or the Kansas Department of Transportation at the
addresses provided.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in Miller County, Arkansas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department and Louisiana Department
of Transportation, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a four-lane,
divided, fully controlled access highway facility located on new alignment. The proposed project along U.S. 71,
from Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas south to the Louisiana State Line, includes several alternatives based on new location
corridors and varying termini. The approximate length of the project is 53.1 kilometers (33.0 miles).





The proposed improvements would improve the capacity of the existing route and increase regional mobility along
a proposed ultimate route extending from Kansas City, Missouri to Shreveport, Louisiana. This project is one of several
projects identified as ``high priority corridors'' on the National Highway System that would provide a transportation
corridor of national significance from Kansas City to Shreveport. The proposed improvements will draw new traffic
through southwest Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and northeast Texas and serve as both a short-term and long-term
economic stimulus, promoting development in this currently rural area. Major metropolitan areas lying along this
``high priority corridor'' include Kansas City, Kansas-Missouri; Joplin, Missouri; Fayetteville, Arkansas,
Fort Smith, Arkansas; Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana.

The northern terminus of the proposed improvements will connect to the proposed Loop 151/245 in Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas.
Loop 151/245 is currently being designed and/or constructed around the south side of Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas.
The southern terminus will be at the Louisiana state line, and its location determined based on existing and new location
U.S. 71 corridors.

Alternatives to be considered are:

(1) The ``Do-Nothing'' Alternative, where roads are constructed according to the regional plan with the exception
of the proposed facility;

(2) The ``Reconstruction'' Alternative, where existing U.S. 71 and roads on the regional plan are upgraded to handle
traffic forecast for the proposed facility, but with less than full control of access; and

(3) The ``New Location'' Alternative, considering several different alignments and full control of access.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, state, and local
agencies and to private organizations, including conservation groups and groups of individuals who have expressed
interest in the project in the past, and to major Arkansas, Louisiana and northeast Texas newspapers. A series of public
involvement sessions will be held in the areas to be affected. In addition, a formal public hearing will be held. Public
notice will be given of the time and place of the public involvement sessions and the public hearing. The draft Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. An agency
scoping meeting was held on December 7, 1993 at the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department offices
in Little Rock, Arkansas.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that two Environmental Impact Statements will be prepared for
a proposed highway that will traverse the northern section of the State of Alabama.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the State of Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare two Environmental
Impact Statements (EIS's) for Project DPS-A002(001). The proposal is to construct a multi-lane, limited access
roadway that will function as a major segment of a Memphis to Atlanta transportation corridor. The facility will provide
a direct link between the two metropolitan areas.




The facility, approximately 273.58 kilometers (170 miles) in length, will be divided into two segments for location
studies and assessment of environmental impacts. Two Environmental Impact Statements will be prepared, one for
the western part of the route, approximately 120.7 kilometer (75 miles) in length, from the Alabama/Mississippi
State line and extending to an undermined point near Interstate Highway 65 near the center of Alabama and the second
Impact Statement written for the eastern part of the project, approximately 152.9 kilometers (95 miles) in length,
beginning at an undetermined point near Interstate Highway 65 near Huntsville, Alabama, and extending to the Alabama/Georgia
border. There will be coordination in the location and environmental studies to establish a common location at I-65.


Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Alternate route locations, (2) a no action alternative, and (3) postponing
the action Alternative.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest
in this proposal. A series of public meetings will be held beginning in early 1994. In addition, public hearings will
also be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearings. The Draft Environmental
Impact Statements will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearings.

<DOCTITLE>Application for Approval of Discontinuance or </DOCTITLE>
Modification of a Railroad Signal System or Relief From the 
Requirements of 49 CFR Part 236


Pursuant to 49 CFR part 235 and 49 U.S.C. App. 26, the following railroads have petitioned the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) seeking approval for the discontinuance or modification of the signal system or relief from the requirements
of 49 CFR part 236 as detailed below. 


Block Signal Application (BS-AP)-No. 3273 




Applicant: 

Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., Mr. R. T. Haley, 
Signal Supervisor C&S, 
201 North Penn Street, 
Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania 15767. 

The Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., seeks approval of the proposed discontinuance and removal of the signal
system, on the single main track, between Macklin, milepost 282.4 and Eidenau, milepost 303.5, near Butler, Pennsylvania,
on the Butler Branch. 
The reason given for the proposed changes is to retire facilities no longer required for present operation. 



Rules Standards & Instructions Application (RS&I-AP)-No. 1089 




Applicant: 

Consolidated Rail Corporation, 
Mr. J. F. Noffsinger, 
Chief Engineer_C&S, 
2001 Market Street, 
P.O. Box 41410, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101-1410. 
Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) seeks relief from the requirements of  236.566 (49 CFR 236.566) of
the Rules, Standard and Instructions to the extent that they be allowed to operate nonequipped locomotives in automatic
cab signal territory, on the two main tracks between ``CP Jacks,'' 
milepost 191.3 and ``CP Gray,'' milepost 223.3, on the Pittsburgh Line, Harrisburg Division, for the following operations:

1. Wire trains, work trains, wreck trains, and ballast cleaners to and from work; 
2. Engines and diesel cars moving to and from shops; and 
3. Engines used in switching and transfer service, with or without cars, not exceeding 20 miles per hour. 
The reason given for the proposed changes is that exemptions are already authorized for operation of nonequipped
locomotives under the same circumstances in cab signal territory at other locations on Conrail, and that this relief
request would be an extention of those already existing exemptions. 


RS&I-AP-No. 1090 




Applicants: 

Union Pacific Railroad Company, 
and Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 
Mr. E. J. McCaddon, 
Director of Locomotive Maintenance Operations, 
Harriman Dispatching Center, 
850 Jones Street, 
Omaha, Nebraska 68102-2920. 
 
The Union Pacific Railroad Company and Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (UP&MP) jointly seek relief from the
requirements of Section 236.590 (49 CFR 236.590) of the Rules, Standard and Instructions for all locomotives owned,
leased, or operated under contract by the UP&MP, equipped with Automatic Train Control Systems (including automatic
train control, automatic train stop, and coded cab signals), to the extent that the carrier be permitted to extend
the current 2 year time limit (736 days) to 3 years, for change out or removal and cleaning of the following pneumatic
valves associated with Automatic Train Control Systems: 
1. ``EBPS''_Engine Brake Pressure Switch 35/20 PSI. 
2. ``SBPS''_Service Brake Pressure Switch 35/20 PSI. 
3. ATC_Magnet Valve. 
4. CCS_Magnet Valve. 
Applicant's justification for relief: To allow easier scheduling of air brake work since time limits would coincide
with other locomotive valves, providing improved inventory control, reducing required inventory, and reducing
locomotive down-time. The carrier also states the failure frequency is less than air brake valves currently changed
and cleaned on a 
3 year basis. 
 

Any interested party desiring to protest the granting of an application shall set forth specifically the grounds
upon which the protest is made, and contain a concise statement of the interest of the protestant in the proceeding.
The original and two copies of the protest shall be filed with the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 within 45 calendar days of the date of 
issuance of this notice. Additionally, one copy of the protest shall be furnished to the applicant at the address listed
above. 
FRA expects to be able to determine these matters without oral hearing. However, if a specific request for an oral hearing
is accompanied by a showing that the party is unable to adequately present his or her position by written statements,
an application may be set for public hearing. 



Issued in Washington, DC on January 7, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of a proposed general permit.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed general permit is intended to regulate placer mining activities in the state of Alaska. EPA, Region
10 has issued almost identical individual permits to these facilities in the past and intends to relieve some of the
administrative burden of issuing individual permits by issuing this general permit. When issued, the proposed permit
will establish effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions and other conditions on discharges from the covered
facilities. These conditions are based on existing national effluent guidelines and material contained in the administrative
record. A description of the basis for the conditions and requirements of the proposed general permit is given in the
fact sheet published below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Executive Order 12866



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the review requirements of Executive Order 12866
pursuant to section 6 of that order.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



After review of the facts presented in the notice printed above, I hereby certify pursuant to the provision of 5 U.S.C.
605(b) that this general NPDES permit will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Moreover, the permit reduces a significant administrative burden on regulated sources.

Technical Information
 


I. Background Information 



A. Permit Coverage 



1. 

General Permit. 

a. Section 301(a) of the CWA provides that the discharge of pollutants is unlawful except in accordance with a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Although such permits have been issued to individual dischargers,
EPA's regulations do authorize the issuance of ``general permits'' to categories of discharges (40 CFR 122.28) when
a number of point sources are: 

(1) Located within the same geographic area and warrant similar pollution control measures; 

(2) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 

(3) Discharge the same types of wastes; 

(4) Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions; 

(5) Require the same or similar monitoring requirements; and 

(6) In the opinion of the Director, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual
permits. 

b. Like individual permits, a violation of a condition contained in a general permit constitutes a violation of the
Act and subjects the owner or operator of the permitted facility to the penalties specified in section 309 of the Act.


c. A Notice of Intent (NOI) to be covered under this General Permit is required (40 CFR 122.28(b)(2)(i)). The requirements
are outlined in Part I.E. of the permit. An Annual Placer Mining Application would be acceptable if it contains all
the items specified in the permit.

<PARENT> FR940114-2-00102 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

d. Coverage under this permit will expire five (5) years from the date of issuance. It is EPA's position (40 CFR 122.28(b)(1))
that an expired general permit continues in force and effect until a new general permit is issued. Only those facilities
authorized to discharge under the expiring general permit and submit an NOI 90 days prior to the expiration of this
general permit are covered by the continued permit. 

2. 

Types of Placer Mine Operations Covered by the Permit. 

EPA is proposing to issue a General NPDES permit for Alaska placer mining operations which are facilities that mine
and process gold placer ores using gravity separation methods to recover the gold metal contained in the ore. This
permit applies to all open-cut and mechanical dredge (not suction dredges) gold placer mines except those open-cut
mines that mine less than 1,500 cubic yards of placer ore per mining season and dredges that remove less than 50,000
cubic yards of placer ore per mining season. These operations are covered by the effluent guidelines and described
in 40 CFR 440.140(b). EPA has completed a literature research project considering the environmental effects of all
suction dredge operation and potential controls that could be placed on them. Based on this research, EPA has concluded
that suction dredges with intake hoses of greater than 4 inches will be covered by this permit. 

Operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden are covered by this permit. 

This permit does not authorize discharges resulting from beneficiation methods utilizing cyanidation, froth flotation,
heap or vat leaching and mercury amalgamation. 

3. 

Limitations on Coverage. 

Many streams and stream reaches in Alaska have been designated as part of the federal wild and scenic rivers system
or as a Conservation System Unit (CSU) by the federal government. Additional conditions may be required by the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game in resident and anadromous fish streams. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important
for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat permit
from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Because this permit does not relieve a permittee of the requirements of
other applicable federal, state or local laws, permittees should contact the appropriate state or federal agencies
to inquire about additional permits that may be required. 

4. 

Individual Permits. 

Owners or operators authorized by a general permit may be excepted from coverage by a general permit by applying to
the Director of the NPDES program for an individual permit. This request may be made by submitting an NPDES permit application,
together with supporting documentation for the request no later than 90 days after publication by EPA of the final
general permit in the 

Federal Register

, or 180 days prior to the commencement of operation of a new source or new discharger. The Director may require any person
authorized by a general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit, or any interested person may petition
the Director to take this action. The Director may consider the issuance of individual permits when: 

a. The single discharge or the cumulative number of discharges is/are a significant contributor of pollution; 

b. The discharger is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the general permit; 

c. A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement
of pollutants applicable to the point source;

d. Effluent limitations guidelines are subsequently promulgated for the point sources covered by the general permit;


e. A Water Quality Management plan containing requirements applicable to such point sources is approved; or 

f. The requirements listed in the previous paragraphs are not met. 



B. Description of the Industry 



1. 

Mechanical Operations (Traditional Sluicing). 

Placer mining involves the mining and extraction of gold or other heavy metals and minerals primarily from alluvial
deposits. These deposits may be in existing stream beds or ancient often buried stream deposits, i.e. paleo or fossil
placers. Many Alaskan placer deposits consist of unconsolidated clay, sand, gravel, cobble and boulders that contain
very small amounts of native gold or other precious metals. Most are stream deposits and occur along present stream
valleys or on benches or terraces above existing streams. Beach placer deposits have been and continue to be important
producers in Alaska. These deposits, most notable near Nome, include both submerged and elevated beach placer deposits.


Essential components of placer mining include overburden removal, mining of the gold placer gravels and processing
(gold recovery). 

a. 

Overburden Removal. 

Various types of overburden include barren alluvial gravels, broken slide rock or glacial deposits. In some parts
of Alaska the pay gravels are overlaid by silty, organic-rich deposits of barren, frozen material generally comprised
of wind-blown particles (loess). Particularly high ice content is common. Most facilities utilize mechanical methods
for removal of overburden because they generally use the same excavating equipment for mining.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940114-2-00163 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-2-00102 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Overburden can also be removed by hydraulicking. 
 Hydraulicking consists of the loosening of material by water 
 delivered under pressure through a hydraulic giant (monitor). 
 The material then flows, usually by gravity, to the sluice box if the 
 overburden is to be processed with the mineral bearing material 
 below. Overburden consisting of barren material may be directed 
 away from the sluice box so that only mineral bearing material is 
 processed in the sluice. 
b. 

Mining Methods. 

Placer mining methods range from dredging systems to open-cut mining. Dredging systems are classified as hydraulic
or 
mechanical, depending on the methods of digging. A floating dredge consists of a supporting hull with a mining control
system, excavating and lifting mechanism, gold recovery circuits, and waste disposal system. They are all designed
to work as a unit to dig, classify, beneficiate ores and dispose of waste. Suction dredges, the most common hydraulic
dredging system, are quite popular in Alaska with the small or recreational gold placer miner. 
A bucket-line dredge has been the traditional gold placer 
 mechanical dredging tool in Alaska. Excavation equipment 
 consists of a chain of buckets, traveling continuously around a 
 truss or plate-girder ladder, that scoop up a load as they are 
 forced against the mining face while pivoting around the lower 
 tumbler and then dump as they pivot around the upper tumbler. 
 The ladder is raised or lowered as required by a large hoisting 
 winch through a system of cables and sheaves. About six placer 
 miners operate bucket-line dredges in Alaska. 
c. 

Processing Methods. 

A large percentage of the present gold placer mining operations use some type of sluice box to perform the primary processing
function, beneficiation. An increasing number of jig plants are 
also being used. Many operations make use of feed size classification which involves the physical separation of large
rocks and boulders from smaller materials such as gravel and sand. The object of classification is to prevent the processing
of large-sized material which is unlikely to contain gold values. Commonly used classification equipment includes:
grizzlies, 
trommels and static or vibrating screens. The most common gold recovery method is sluicing. A sluice is a long, sloped
trough into which water is directed to effectuate separation of gold from ore. A slurry of water and ore flows down the
sluice and the gold, due to its relatively high density, is trapped in riffles along the sluice. 
2. 

Suction Dredging. 

A suction dredge is a mechanical device which floats on the stream surface and which pumps stream water and stream bed
material through a suction intake conduit to a sluice box from which gold or 
other minerals may be recovered. 
The discharge from suction dredges consists totally of stream water 
and bed material. These discharges are becoming numerous in the 
state. The discharge limits and monitoring requirements are identical 
for the majority of these discharges. This category of discharges 
meets the qualifications of 40 CFR 122.59 for the issuance of General 
Discharge Permits. This general discharge permit will expedite 
processing the numerous applications and provide the same regulatory 
controls over the discharges as an individual permit would. 


II. Effluent Characteristics 


Discharges from placer mining operations consist of water and the naturally occurring materials found in the alluvial
deposits (e.g. sand, silt, clay, trace minerals and metals, etc.). Some of the elements measured in placer mine effluent
are derived principally from sulfide, oxide, carbonate, and silicate mineral species, and include antimony, arsenic,
cadmium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc. Most of these parameters are found in trace amounts
and are of little significance. 
Based on review of sampling data collected by EPA and upon evaluation of 
 Alaska Water Quality Standards (WQS), EPA has concluded that the pollutants 
 of primary concern are settleable solids, turbidity, and arsenic. Arsenic is the only toxic pollutant of concern
due to its naturally occurring abundance in most Alaskan soils. 


III. Basis for Effluent Limitations 


A. Background 


Effluent limits required in this permit for the control of pollutants are 
 published in 40 CFR part 440, Subpart M_Gold Placer Mine Subcategory, which 
 was promulgated May 24, 1988, in 53 FR 18764. Additional information 
 regarding the basis for establishing the effluent limits is summarized in the 
 EPA publication titled ``Development Document for Effluent Limitations 
 Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Ore Mining and 
 Dressing Point Source Category_Gold Placer Mine Subcategory'' (May 
 1988). 
This final rule establishes effluent limitations guidelines and standards based on the best practicable control
technology currently available (BPT), the best available technology economically achievable (BAT), and new source

 performance standards (NSPS) based on the best available demonstrated 
 technology. The BAT and NSPS limitations represent the minimum 
 technology required to be in place for all placer mining operations covered 
 under 40 CFR part 440, subpart M.

<DOCNO> FR940114-2-00164 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-2-00102 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 402(o) of the Act stipulates that NPDES permits may not be reissued to contain effluent limitations that are
less stringent than comparable water quality standards and technology based effluent limitations in the previous
permit. EPA has determined that this general permit complies with these anti-backsliding provisions of the Act.

 

B. Technology-Based Limitations 
 

1. 

Mechanical Operations. 

The CWA requires industries to apply treatment technology representing BAT that is economically achievable. The
BAT 
requirements specify the use of settling ponds plus total recirculation of 
process wastewater as the selected treatment technology. However, 
the regulation does allow the discharge of incidental waters (including 
waters that enter a mine through precipitation, snow melt, drainage 
water, ground water infiltration and the melting of permafrost) which 
have commingled with process waters, provided that these incidental 
waters are in excess of the make-up water required, are treated in 
settling ponds and do not exceed 0.2 ml/l settleable solids prior to 
discharge. 
For the purpose of this permit, discharged wastewater consists of 
incidental waters commingled with process waters used to move the 
ore to and through the beneficiation process, water used to aid in 
classification, and water used in gravity separation. Pursuant to 40 
CFR 440.143, BAT requirements are as follows: 
a. The concentration of settleable solids in wastewater discharged 
from an open-cut mine plant or a dredge plant site must not 
exceed an instantaneous maximum of 0.2 ml/l. 
b. The volume of wastewater which may be discharged from an 
open-cut mine plant or dredge plant site must not exceed the 
volume of infiltration, drainage and mine drainage waters which is 
in excess of the make-up water required for operation of the 
beneficiation process. 
These technology-based requirements are specified in Parts II.A.1.a. 
and b. of the proposed permit. 
The effect of requirement II.A.2. of the proposed permit is to prohibit 
the discharge of any wastewater during periods when new water is 
allowed to enter the plant site. 


C. Water Quality Based Limits 


In addition to the BAT effluent limitations, the permit includes effluent 
limitations which are required to ensure compliance with WQS (Alaska 
Regulations 18 AAC 70). These standards vary with the beneficial use they 
are established to protect. In water bodies with more than one designated 
beneficial use, the more restrictive criteria apply. 
The WQS protect most fresh water sources for use in drinking, agriculture, 
aquaculture and industrial water supply, contact and secondary recreation, 
and the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic life 
(Alaska Regulations 18 AAC 70.050). All permits being issued in this round 
of permitting must protect for all the above uses. 
EPA has concluded, based on review of the WQS and available sampling 
data, that the parameters of turbidity and arsenic must be limited in order to 
meet the State WQS. Also, the sediment standard must be applied to 
discharges from operations utilizing the hydraulic removal of overburden. 
The arsenic, turbidity and sediment limits were established pursuant to 
section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA, which requires imposition of ``* * * any more 
stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet water quality 
standards, * * * or required to implement any applicable water quality 
standard established pursuant to this Act.'' The NPDES regulations, at 40 
CFR 122.44(d), require NPDES permits to include conditions to ``Achieve 
water quality standards established under section 303 of CWA 
* * *.'' 
1. 

Turbidity: 


a. Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden According to the WQS, the most restrictive turbidity criteria
applies to fresh water sources classified for water contact recreation uses. These criteria (18 AAC 70.020(b)(1)(B)(i)(4))
state that turbidity * * * ``Shall not exceed 5 NTU above natural conditions when the natural turbidity
is 50 NTU or less; and more than 10% increase in turbidity when the natural condition is more 
than 50 NTU, not to exceed a maximum increase of 15 NTU.'' The proposed draft permit contains a turbidity limit that
would assure compliance with water quality standards under worst case conditions. That is, the turbidity in the effluent
must not exceed 5 NTUs above the background turbidity level in the receiving stream. This condition accounts for naturally
occurring turbidity 
in the receiving water and allows the effluent to contain an additional 5 NTUs of turbidity where the receiving water
is naturally turbid. The permit condition does not account for those situations where naturally occurring turbidity
would allow an increase of up to 15 NTUs, nor does it account for the dilution effects of the receiving stream. The reason
for assuming worst 
case conditions is that EPA does not have current site-specific 
information to establish end-of-pipe limitations for each of the permits being processed. 
Although worst case conditions are assumed in the proposed 
draft permit, EPA will consider modifying the NTU limitation to 
account for the dilution effects of the receiving stream. EPA's 
approach in setting higher turbidity limitations is dependent upon 
receipt of the NOI with information from the permittee or from the 
Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR) acting on behalf 
of the permittee demonstrating that the dilution effect of the 
receiving water justifies a less stringent limit. EPA is operating 
under the assumption that the permit applicant bears the burden 
of providing information necessary to issue the permit (40 CFR 
124.85(a)(1)). Where the applicant does not provide the 
site-specific information that would justify a less stringent turbidity 
limit, the permit issued to a site will contain the turbidity limit 
proposed in the draft permit.

<TEXT>
 

The procedures used to calculate a higher turbidity limit are the 
 same as those used in the placer mining permits issued since 
 1986. The turbidity limit is based on utilizing a mass balance 
 equation which relates upstream receiving water flow and 
 turbidity to effluent flow and turbidity. The basic form of this 
 equation is: 





Q

1

C

1

+Q

2

C

=Q

C

,




where 




C

1

 = upstream turbidity; 
C

2

 = effluent turbidity; 
C

3

 = downstream turbidity after mixing where the allowable increase is 5 NTU above background (C

1

+5 NTU); 
Q

1

 = stream flow downstream from any diversion and upstream from the discharge; 

Q

2

 = effluent flow*; and, 
Q

3

 = total stream flow downstream from discharge after complete mixing. 




*A default value of 10 gallons per minute (GPM) will be 
 used if the NOI states that zero discharge will be achieved. 
 The information that must be submitted by the permittee to 
 determine the appropriate turbidity limit for the facility is the 
 effluent and receiving stream flow rates. The receiving stream 
 flow rate must be measured upstream from the discharge point 
 and downstream from any diversions. Receiving stream flow 
 values can be obtained from the ADNR, Division of Mining, upon 
 request by the permittee. ADNR methodology for determining 
 upstream flow uses equations developed by Ashton and Carlson 
 (1984). The maximum effluent discharge flow must be estimated 
 by the permittee and must account for the effects of all excess 
 incidental waters. 

Permittees requesting a higher turbidity limitation must submit the 
 necessary information to EPA with the NOI. This applies to all 
 permittees, including those who have submitted this type of 
 information in the past, in order to assure that all site-specific 
 information is up-to-date. 
b. 

Suction Dredging.

 The daily visual inspection during operation of an area 
 downstream of the suction dredge is based on research 
 published in the scientific literature (Griffith and Andrews 1981, 
 Hassler et al. 1986, Harvey 1986, Huber and Blanchet 1992, 
 Thomas 1985) and on monitoring done by Alaska Department of 
 Environmental Conservation (ADEC) (Ron McAlister, ADEC, 
 personal communication). In most cases, water quality 
 recovered rapidly below the dredge. ADEC found that turbidity 
 was elevated 1 to 4.5 NTU 500 feet downstream of an operating 
 10 inch dredge. The daily visual inspection during operation 
 should assure that the water quality standard for turbidity is met. 
2. 

Arsenic_Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden. 

EPA has concluded, based on available sampling data, that arsenic is 
 commonly associated with placer mining wastes. Locally, it is the most 
 abundant toxic metal present. For this reason, EPA has determined 
 that arsenic is a pollutant of concern. Additionally, although several studies by EPA have indicated a reduction
in levels of arsenic in placer mining effluent as a result of reducing settleable solids to 0.2 ml/l, EPA has concluded
that these reduced levels of arsenic are not consistently adequate to achieve 
 WQS.

In establishing the arsenic limit, the ``Amendments to the Water Quality 
 Standards Regulation; Compliance with CWA section 303(c)(2)(B); 
 Final Rule'' (57 FR 6084, Tuesday, December 22, 1992) are used. This 
 rulemaking promulgated the chemical-specific numeric criteria for 
 priority toxic pollutants necessary to bring all States into compliance 
 with the requirements of the CWA section 303(c)(2)(B). The primary 
 focus of the rule is the inclusion of the federal water quality criteria for 
 pollutant(s) in State standards as necessary to support water quality-based control programs (e.g. NPDES permits).
The federal standard 
 of 0.18  u g/l total recoverable arsenic is applicable to Alaska and this 
 number has been used to derive the end-of-pipe limitation for the draft 
 permits. 
Mixing zones are allowed under the Alaska standards for some 
 pollutant discharges. However, 18 AAC 70.032(a) states * * * ``In 
 applying the water quality criteria set out in this chapter, the 
 department will, upon application and in its discretion, prescribe in its 
 permits or certifications a volume of dilution for an effluent or 
 substance within a receiving water unless pollutants discharged could 
 bioaccumulate; concentrate or persist in the environment; cause 
 carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects; or otherwise present a 
 risk to human health * * *'' Arsenic is a carcinogen. In a letter, dated 
 March 24, 1992, from the Alaska Department of Environmental 
 Conservation Commissioner, John Sandor, to EPA Water Division 
 Director, Charles Findley, the State has interpreted this to mean that 
 ``* * * a mixing zone may be prescribed where there is no reasonable 
 expectation of an adverse effect on human health or aquatic life, based 
 on site-specific, chemical, physical and biological characteristics.'' EPA 
 is not proposing a mixing zone for arsenic but would include a method 
 for determining a mixing zone in the permit if the Department 
 determines that such a mixing zone is appropriate and is in compliance 
 with WQS. 

Two options are given to the permittee to determine the arsenic limit. 
 If the ``natural'' background is not measured, the effluent limit is set 
 according to federal standard at 0.18
  u g/l. The other option depends 
 on the ``natural'' background levels of arsenic present in the receiving 
 water. The ``natural'' background is defined as the total recoverable 
 arsenic level upstream from all mining and other man-made 
 disturbances. The WQS, 18 AC 70.010(a), states that ``[n]o person 
 may conduct an operation that * * * contributes to a violation of the 
 water quality standards * * *'' If the ``natural'' background levels are 
 already above the federal standard, any discharge at or below the 
 ``natural'' background level will not elevate the existing concentrations in 
 the stream thus not contributing further to a violation of WQS. The 
 ``natural'' background data must be provided with the annual Discharge 
 Monitoring Report (DMR). 
Because the effluent limitation of 0.18  u g/L is not quantifiable using the 
 EPA approved analytical method (206.2), EPA has set a reporting 
 threshold to measure the highest acceptable quantification level for this 
 parameter. When results cannot be quantified, values below the 
 method detection level (1  u g/L) shall be report as zero and values 
 above the method detection level but below the minimum level 
 (4  u g/L) reported at 1/2 the minimum level or 2  u g/L. This reporting 
 threshold does not authorize the discharge of this parameter in excess 
 of the effluent limitation. 

3. 

Sediment. 

 The sediment standard (18 ACC 70.020) is a narrative standard which 
 reads, ``No increase in concentration of sediment, including settleable 
 solids, above natural conditions.'' The method indicated for measuring 
 sediments is the use of an Imhoff cone. The detection limit, the lowest 
 measurable value, of an Imhoff cone is 0.2 ml/l. Therefore the 
 maximum limit for sediment will be 0.2 ml/l measured as settleable 
 solids for operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden. 



IV. Basis for Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 
 


A. 

Monitoring:

 All self-monitoring requirements considered the remoteness of 
 the mining operations, the magnitude of the pollutants discharged, and the 
 practicability of maintaining a valid quality assurance program. 

1. The measurement of settleable solids is an indication of overall 
 treatment efficiency. The permit requires monitoring for settleable 
 solids once per day during periods of discharge. If there is a 
 discharge to waters of the United States, permittees are required to 
 sample for settleable solids on a daily basis, even if sluicing does not 
 occur. This is required because the operator is responsible at all times 
 for the condition of the wastewater entering the receiving stream. Also, 
 the results from settleable solids sampling can give the operator an 
 immediate indication of the overall effectiveness of the treatment 
 system and thus allow advanced planning for treatment system 
 maintenance. 

2. EPA has concluded that the monitoring frequency for turbidity and 
 arsenic will be once per season. Monitoring for these pollutants have 
 been established at less frequent intervals because sampling and 
 analysis for these parameters are more difficult and costly. Samples 
 for monitoring purposes must be taken during sluicing or discharge at 
 a time when the operation has reached equilibrium. For example, 
 samples should be taken when sluice paydirt loading and effluent 
 discharge are fairly constant.

3. Effluent flow monitoring is also required in the proposed permit. The purpose of this requirement is to assess the
pollutant loading discharged into the receiving water. 

4. The visual inspection provision in Part II.D.1. of the proposed permit is required to assure against discharges
resulting from structural failure of berms, dikes, dams and other water control structures. A visual inspection
is an effective tool for assuring proper operation and maintenance. 

5. Monitoring provisions for turbidity, arsenic, settleable solids, and flow (in Parts II.D.1.c., d., e., and f.,
respectively) are included in the proposed permit. These provisions are included to explain how, when, and where
to collect these samples. 

B. 

Reporting. 

1. Reporting of effluent violations is required in writing within a reasonable time period. This is found in Permit
Part IV.G.2.c. 

2. Reporting of visual violations from suction dredges is required in writing within a reasonable time period. This
is found in Permit Part II.D.2.b. 

3. The results of all monitoring or notice of no discharge must be reported to EPA by November 30 of each year. This is
found in Permit Part IV.B. 



V. Best Management Practices (BMPs) 



A. Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden 



1. BMP conditions in Permit Parts III.A.1. to III.A.5. of the proposed permit were developed pursuant to section 304(e)
of the CWA. These BMPs are established in 40 CFR 440.148 and are necessary for control and treatment of the drainage
and infiltration water at gold placer mines and to prevent solids and toxic metals from being released to the receiving
streams. 

a. The intent of Permit Part III.A.1. is to avoid contamination of nonprocess water, reduce the volume of water requiring
treatment and maximize the retention time and the settling capacity of the settling ponds. The diversion must totally
circumvent any gold recovery units, treatment facilities, etc. Any mine drainage sources that pass through the actual
mining area and are subject to transporting pollutants must be treated prior to discharge. 

b. Permit Part III.A.2. is required to assure that water retention devices are constructed appropriately. This may
be achieved by utilizing on-site material in a manner that the fine sealing material (such as clays) are mixed in the
berms with coarser materials. Berms should be toed into the underlying earth, constructed in layers or lifts and each
layer thoroughly compacted to ensure mechanical and watertight integrity of the berms. Other impermeable material
such as plastic sheets or membranes may be used inside the berms when sealing fines are unavailable or in short supply.
The side slope of berms should not be greater than the natural angle of repose of the materials used in the berms or a slope
of 2:1, whichever is flatter. 

c. The intent of Permit Part III.A.3 is to ensure that the investment in pollution control pay the maximum benefit in
terms of reduced pollutant volumes reaching water of the United States. These measures may include location of the
storage ponds and storage areas to assure that they will not be washed out by reasonably predictable flooding or by
the return of a relocated stream to it original stream bed. Materials removed from settling ponds should be placed
in bermed areas where liquids from the materials cannot flow overland to waters of the United States. It may be necessary,
in some cases, to collect such liquids and pump or divert them back to the settling pond for treatment. This requirement
applies both during the active mining season and at all other times until reclamation is completed. 

d. Permit Part III.A.4. is required to assure that the amount of wastewater that is discharged is kept to a minimum.


e. The provisions of Permit Part III.A.5. will ensure that water control devices are adequately maintained. This
specifies that structures should be inspected on a regular basis for any signs of structural weakness or incipient
failure. Whenever such weakness or incipient failure becomes evident, repair or augmentation of the structure to
reasonably ensure against catastrophic failure shall be made immediately. 

2. BMP condition Permit Part III.A.6. of the proposed permit is required pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). The purpose
of this requirement is to assure that all reasonable measures are taken to decrease the amount of pollutants being
discharged to waters of the United States. 

3. The same BMPs are required of operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3).
The purpose of these requirements is to assure that reasonable measures are taken to decrease the amount of pollutants
being discharged to waters of the United States.

<DOCNO> FR940114-2-00168 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940114-2-00102 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

B. Suction Dredging 



The BMPs are required pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). 

1. Dredging is permitted only in the active stream channel where the dredging spoils are relatively clean and will
cause minimum turbidity when returned to the stream. The material that runs through a suction dredge flows downstream
and settles among gravel and rocks in the streambed. Too much silt and sand make it difficult for the salmon to dig suitable
gravel nests (redds) and can also smother fish eggs already deposited. 

2. Wherever practicable, the dredge shall be set to discharge into a quiet pool where settling of dredge spoils can
occur more rapidly. This will cause in-stream turbidity to be minimized and localized to the general area of the dredging
activity. 

3. The purpose of this requirement is to control the potential discharge of pollutants, resulting from fuel spills,
from entering receiving waters. 

4. Dredging is not permitted during the periods that fish eggs could be in the gravel at the dredge site. The greatest
single effect a suction dredge has on the environment is the danger it poses to fish. The dredge pump forces water and
gravel through the nozzle and hose. Fish eggs taken up with gravel cannot survive the shock, pressure, and battering
and pounding that comes with moving through the hose and sluice. If a fish egg should somehow survive the hose and sluice,
the chances for being buried in the gravel at the right depth and in the correct gravel composition necessary for incubation
are nonexistent. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous
Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat permit from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This
catalog is quite extensive but is available for viewing at many agencies including Alaska Department of Fish and Game,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Anchorage Operations Office of EPA.




VI. Other Requirements 



A. Spill Prevention Control and Containment (SPCC) Plan 



Part III.C. of the proposed permit was established in accordance with 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). The purpose of this requirement
is to control the potential discharge of pollutants, resulting from fuel spills, from entering receiving waters.




B. Endangered Species 



A species list was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the state of Alaska. The recommended protection
measures for the species of concern during the nesting period prohibits alterations of limited, high quality habitat
which could detrimentally and significantly reduce prey availability. Since this general water discharge permit
is written to protect aquatic life or human health criteria (whichever is more stringent), no alterations of habitat
due to water discharges authorized by this permit should occur. Because of this, EPA has determined that formal consultation
for section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not necessary for existing facilities. Environmental Assessments
will be completed for each new source discharge as is stated in Part I.A.3. of the permit. Any consultation necessary
to comply with the Endangered Species Act will be performed at this time. 



VII. Storm Exemption 



Part III.D. of the proposed permit establishes a storm exemption provision which authorizes exceedences of technology-based
effluent limitations and standards provided that the permittee meets certain design and operational criteria.
This provision is required pursuant to 40 CFR 440.141(b). 

This provision allows for the unavoidable exceedence of technology-based effluent limitations during storms of
intensity greater than or equal to a 5-year, 6-hour storm event. The storm exemption will be allowed provided that
(1) the settling ponds are designed, constructed, and maintained to contain the volume of process water generated
during four hours of normal operation plus the drainage water resulting from a 5-year, 6-hour storm event, (2) the
operator takes all reasonable steps possible to maintain treatment of the wastewater and minimize overflow from
the settling ponds, (3) the permittee must be in compliance with the BMPs in Part III.A. of the proposed permit, and
(4) the operator complies with all the notification requirements for bypasses and upsets as established in Parts
III.G. and H. of the proposed permit. Part III.D. of the proposed permit establishes the specific conditions which
must be met in order to be eligible for the storm exemption. 

This exemption is designed to provide an affirmative defense to an enforcement action. Therefore, the operator has
the burden of demonstrating to the appropriate authority that the above conditions have been met. 



VIII. Prohibitions

<TEXT>
 

A. Part I.C. has been incorporated into the proposed permit to further clarify the discharges that will be authorized
under this permit. 

B. Part II.A.2. of the proposed permit is required to assure compliance with the technology-based requirements established
in Part II.A.1.a. of the proposed permit. 



IX. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) 



Pursuant to section 301 of the CWA, NSPS (40 CFR 440.144) were promulgated 
 for gold placer mine facilities. NSPS apply to new mines determined to be new 
 sources by virtue of their activities occurring after promulgation of the rule (May 24, 1988). The NSPS for gold placer
mining facilities are based on the same treatment technology as BAT, which consists of simple settling plus recirculation
of all process water. Since BAT is based on the most stringent demonstrated technology that is available for treating
gold placer mine wastewater, those mines which are new sources will not be subject to controls more stringent than
those applicable to existing mines. 

In accordance with section 511(c)(1) of the CWA, NPDES permits for new 
 sources are subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act 
 (NEPA). NEPA requires that, prior to the issuance of an NPDES permit to a new 
 source facility, an Environmental Assessment (EA) must be prepared to determine 
 the potential for any significant impacts on the quality of the human environment 
 resulting from operation of the new source. Permit part I.E.1. requires that new 
 facilities submit a notice of intent by January 1 of the year of discharge. This will 
 allow adequate time to complete EAs for each new source prior to the mining 
 season. If the EA indicates that significant adverse environmental impacts may 
 occur, then the applicant must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). 
 However, if the EA indicates that significant impacts are not anticipated, a Finding 
 of No Significant Impact (FNSI) shall be issued and the facility will be covered by 
 the existing general permit. The FNSI may be based, in part, on required 
 permit conditions or mitigation measures necessary to make the recommended 
 alternative environmentally acceptable. 



X. State Certification 



Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act requires that an NPDES permit contain conditions 
 which ensure compliance with applicable State water quality standards or 
 limitations. The limitations for turbidity and arsenic were established pursuant to 
 WQS and federal standards, respectively. Section 401 requires that States certify 
 that Federally issued permits are in compliance with State law. No permits can be 
 issued until the requirements of Section 401 are satisfied. 

These are permits for operations discharging to waters (inland waters) of the State 
 of Alaska. EPA is requesting State officials to review and provide appropriate 
 certification to these draft permits pursuant to 40 CFR 124.53.

Finding of No Significant Impact 



To all interested government agencies, 
 public groups, and individuals: 

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
 procedures for complying with the National Environmental Policy 
 Act (NEPA), 40 CFR part 6, subpart F, EPA has completed an 
 environmental review of the following proposed action: Issuance of a General National Pollutant Discharge 
 Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. AK-G-37-0000 
 for Alaskan Placer Miners.

The proposed action is issuance of a General NPDES Permit covering both 
existing and new source facilities in Alaska which mine and process, using gravity 
separation methods, gold placer ores. The proposed effluent limitations, monitoring 
provisions, and other conditions are specified in the draft General NPDES permit. The 
Fact Sheet, accompanying the draft permit, describes the basis for these 
requirements. The proposed General NPDES Permit would replace the existing 
individual NPDES permits.

<PARENT> FR940114-2-00102 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An environmental assessment (EA) of this proposed action has been completed 
(enclosed). Based on the EA, and in accordance with the guidelines for determining 
the significance of proposed federal actions (40 CFR 1508.27) and EPA criteria for 
initiating an environmental impact statement (EIS) (40 CFR 6.605), EPA has concluded 
that the proposed General NPDES permit will not result in a significant effect on the 
human environment. The proposed permit will not significantly affect land use patterns 
or population, wetlands or floodplains, threatened or endangered species, farmlands, 
ecologically critical areas, historic resources, air quality, water quality, noise levels, fish 
and wildlife resources, nor will it conflict with local, regional, or state land use plans or 
policies. The proposed permit conforms with all applicable federal statutes and 
executive orders. 

The proposed General Permit includes the same technology-based permit limits, 
established by regulation (40 CFR part 440, subpart M), as the individual permits 
currently do. The recirculation of process wastewater is required and the settleable 
solids concentration of the allowable discharge (i.e. excess water) is limited to 0.2 
milliliters per liter. Water quality-based limits are also included in the proposed permit. 

The proposed permit covers, in addition to conventional open-cut placer mining 
operations, placer mining operations utilizing hydraulic methods to remove 
overburden, and suction dredges. The proposed permit limits for the hydraulic 
overburden removal operations are based on the state sediment standard and best 
professional judgment and are the same as the limits for the conventional operations. The limits for the suction dredge
operations would be based on best professional 
judgment. 

The proposed General Permit would reduce the yearly administrative burden of 
EPA associated with the processing of numerous individual permits. Because the 
proposed General Permit and individual permits include essentially the same 
requirements, the primary impact related to permit type is expected to be 
administrative. No negative impacts to EPA, other agencies or operators are 
expected. 

The proposed General NPDES Permit may contribute to an improvement in 
environmental conditions because it would reduce the permitting administrative 
workload thus making available limited time that could be used for higher priority 
activities, such as permit compliance and inspections. The inclusion of suction dredge 
operations in the General Permit will improve the monitoring and compliance of these 
operations. 

Under the proposed action, the new source placer mining proposals requesting 
coverage under the General Permit would continue to be subject to individual NEPA 
reviews. This will enable EPA to evaluate the site-specific and cumulative impacts 
associated with the individual projects. Where an EA concludes that significant 
impacts are not anticipated, a Finding of No Significant Impact would be issued and 
the new source project would be granted coverage under the General Permit. If EPA 
determines that significant impacts from a proposed new source project may occur, an 
EIS would be prepared prior to EPA's final permit decision. Therefore the site-specific 
impacts of those projects would continue to be evaluated and considered prior to the 
permit actions. An individual permit may also be required by EPA in lieu of coverage 
under the General Permit. 

For the above reasons EPA has determined that an EIS will not be prepared for 
the proposed action. 

Comments pertaining to this Finding of No Significant Impact may be submitted to: Rick Seaborne, Environmental Protection
Agency, Environmental Review Section, 1200 Sixth Avenue, WD-126, Seattle, WA 98101. 

No administrative action will be taken for at least 30 days after the release of this 
Finding of No Significant Impact. EPA will fully consider all comments before taking 
final action.

of this permit upon the submittal of a Notice of Intent (NOI) to gain coverage under this permit. Coverage will be granted
according to Permit Part E.4. 
2. 

Pending Applications: 

Upon submittal of an NOI all facilities which have submitted applications in accordance with 40 CFR 122.21(a) are
authorized under the terms and conditions of this permit. Coverage will be granted according to Permit Part E.4. 
3. 

New Facilities: 

New facilities that are determined to be new sources under the CWA will be required to have an Environmental Assessment
(EA) completed pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). A finding of no significant impact (FNSI)
by EPA is necessary prior to receiving coverage under this permit. If there will be a significant impact, the facility
will be required to submit, to EPA, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Facilities determined to be new dischargers
will be covered by the terms and conditions of this permit if they meet all the necessary requirements of the coverage.

4. 

Expanding Facilities: 

Facilities that contemplate expanding shall submit a new NOI that describes the new discharge. The old permit will
be terminated and a new permit issued in its place if the facility meets all the necessary requirements of the coverage.



B. Types of Placer Mine Operations Covered


1. Facilities that mine and process gold placer ores using gravity separation methods to recover the gold metal contained
in the ore. 
a. Open-cut gold placer mines except those open-cut mines that mine less than 1,500 cubic yards of placer ore per mining
season. 
b. Mechanical dredge gold placer mines (not suction dredges) except those dredges that remove less than 50,000 cubic
yards of placer ore per mining season. 
2. Suction dredges with intake hoses of greater than 4 inches. 
3. Operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden. 


C. Limitations on Coverage 


Many streams and stream reaches in Alaska have been designated as part of the federal wild and scenic rivers system
or as Conservation System Units (CSUs) by the federal government. Permittees should contact the district offices
of the federal agencies that administer the designated area for additional restrictions that may apply to operating
within the area. Many streams in Alaska where placer mining occurs have been designated by Alaska Department of Fish
and Game (ADFG) as needing an ADFG Habitat permit with additional restrictions. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters
Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat
permit. 


D. Prohibitions 


Discharges from the following beneficiation processes are not authorized under this permit: Mercury amalgamation,
cyanidation, froth floatation, heap and vat leaching. 


E. Requiring an Individual Permit 


1. The Regional Administrator may require any person authorized by this permit to apply for and obtain an individual
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit when: 
a. The single discharge or the cumulative number of discharges is/are a significant contributor of pollution; 
b. The discharger is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the general permit; 
c. A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement
of pollutants applicable to the point source; 
d. Effluent limitations guidelines are subsequently promulgated for the point sources covered by the general permit;

e. A Water Quality Management plan containing requirements applicable to such point sources is approved; or

f. An Individual Control Strategy (ICS) is required under section 304(L) of the Act. 

2. The Regional Administrator will notify the operator in writing that a permit application is required. If an operator
fails to submit in a timely manner an individual NPDES permit application as required, then the applicability of this
general permit to the individual NPDES permittee is automatically terminated at the end of the day specified for application
submittal. 

3. Any owner or operator authorized by this permit may request to be excluded from the coverage of this permit by applying
for an individual permit. The owner or operator shall submit an individual application (Form 1 and Form 2C or 2D) with
reasons supporting the request to the Regional Administrator no later than 90 days after the effective date of the
permit. 

4. When an individual NPDES permit is issued to an owner or operator otherwise covered by this permit, the applicability
of this permit to the facility is automatically terminated on the effective date of the individual permit. 

5. When an individual NPDES permit is denied to an owner or operator otherwise covered to this permit, the permittee
is automatically reinstated under this permit on the date of such denial, unless otherwise specified by the Regional
Administrator. A new facility can receive coverage under this general permit by submitting a NOI. See Permit Part
I.A.3. for details. 

6. A source excluded from a general permit solely because it already has an individual permit may request that the individual
permit be revoked and that it be covered by the general permit. Upon revocation of the individual permit, the general
permit shall apply to the source. 



F. Notification Requirements 



1. Owners or operators of facilities authorized by this permit shall submit a NOI to be covered by this permit. The information
required for a complete NOI is in appendix A of this permit. Notification must be made: 

a. Within 90 days of issuance of this permit; or 

b. By January 1 of the year of discharge from a new facility or a facility established since 1988 that has not previously
been covered by a permit; or 

c. Ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of an existing individual permit. Authorization to discharge requires
written notification from EPA that coverage has been granted and that a specific permit number has been assigned to
the operation. 

2. The NOI shall be signed by the owner or other signatory authority in accordance with Part VI.H. (Signatory Requirements),
and a copy shall be retained on site in accordance with Part IV.F. (Retention of Records) of this permit. The address
for NOI submission to EPA is: United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10, 1200 Sixth Avenue, WD-134,
Seattle, Washington 98101. 

3. A copy of the NOI must also be sent to the regional office of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
(ADEC) that has jurisdiction over the mine. The addresses are:

Alaska 99503 


 


4. A copy of the general permit will be sent to the permittee when it is determined that the facility can be granted coverage
under this general permit. If it is determined that coverage cannot be granted under this permit, the applicant will
be informed of this in writing. 



G. Permit Expiration 



Coverage under this permit will expire five (5) years from the date of issuance. For facilities submitting a new NOI
90 days prior to expiration of this general permit, the conditions of the expired permit continue in force until the
effective date of a new permit. 



II. Effluent Limitations 



A. Mechanical Operation (Traditional Sluicing) 



During the term of this permit, no wastewater discharges are authorized except as specified below. 

1. Effluent Limitations.

a. The volume of wastewater which may be discharged shall not exceed the volume of infiltration, drainage and mine
drainage waters which is in excess of the make-up water required for operation of the beneficiation process. 

b. The wastewater discharged shall not exceed the following:

2. Effluent discharges are prohibited during periods when new water is allowed to enter the plant site. Additionally,
there shall be no discharge as a result of the intake of new water. 



B. Hydraulic Removal of Overburden 



During the term of this permit, no wastewater discharges are authorized except as specified below. 

1. Effluent Limitations. a. The volume of wastewater which may be discharged shall not exceed the volume of infiltration,
drainage and mine drainage waters which is in excess of the make-up water required for operation of the hydraulicking
process. 

b. The wastewater discharged shall not exceed the following: 



 


2. Effluent discharges are prohibited during periods when new water is allowed to enter the plant site. Additionally,
there shall be no discharge as a result of the intake of new water. 



C. Suction Dredging 



1. At any point in the receiving stream 500 feet downstream of the dredge's discharge point, the maximum allowable
increase in turbidity over the natural receiving stream turbidity while operating is 5 NTUs. 

2. A visual increase in turbidity (any cloudiness or muddiness) 500 feet downstream of the suction dredge during operations
would be considered a violation of the 5 NTU limit. 

3. If noticeable turbidity does occur 500 feet downstream of the work site, operation of the suction dredge must decrease
or cease so that a violation as defined above does not exist. 



D. Monitoring Requirements 



1. Mechanical Operations and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden. a. During the period beginning on the effective date
of this permit and lasting until the expiration date, the following monitoring shall be conducted: 



 


b. Visual Inspection. The Permittee shall institute a comprehensive visual inspection program to facilitate proper
operation and maintenance of the recycle system and the wastewater treatment system. The Permittee shall conduct
an inspection of the site once per day during the mining season. The Permittee shall maintain records of all information
resulting from any visual inspections. These records shall include, but are not limited to, an evaluation of the condition
of all water control devices such as diversion structures and berms and all solids retention structures such as berms,
dikes, pond structures, and dams. The records shall also include an assessment of the presence of sediment buildup
within the settling ponds. The Permittee shall examine all ponds for the occurrence of short circuiting. 

c. Turbidity Monitoring. The Permittee shall monitor the turbidity values of the effluent stream and the background
turbidity values of the receiving stream then compare the two samples. The sample results shall be reported on the
Annual Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR). The Permittee shall take one sample at a point that is representative of
the discharge prior to entering the receiving stream. The Permittee shall take another sample above the discharge
point at a location that is considered to be the ``natural'' background of the receiving stream as defined in permit
part V.I. Both samples shall be taken within a reasonable time frame. Monitoring shall be conducted in accordance
with accepted analytical procedures. See attachment 1 for sampling protocol. 

d. Arsenic Monitoring. Arsenic samples shall be representative of the discharge and shall be taken at a point prior
to entering the receiving stream. Arsenic samples taken to determine ``natural'' background shall be representative
of the receiving water upstream from any man-made disturbances. Monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with
accepted analytical procedures. The Permittee shall report the sample results on the Annual DMR. See attachment
2 for sampling protocol.

The effluent limitation for total recoverable arsenic is not quantifiable 
 using the EPA approved analytical method, EPA method 206.2. 
 
Thus, EPA has set forth reporting thresholds to measure the 
 highest acceptable quantification level for this parameter. This 
 reporting threshold does not authorize the discharge of this 
 parameter in excess of the effluent limitation. For more information, 
 see special conditions in Part IX. of this permit. 

e. Settleable Solids Monitoring. Settleable solids samples shall be representative of the discharge 
 and shall be taken at a point prior to entering the receiving stream. 
 Monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with accepted 
 analytical procedures (Standard Methods, 16th Edition, 1985). The 
 Permittee shall report the sample results on the Annual DMR. See 
 attachment 3 for sampling and analysis protocol. 
 
f. Flow Monitoring. Effluent flow shall be measured at the discharge prior to entering 
 the receiving water. Effluent flow shall be measured at least once 
 per day, for continuous discharges, or once during each discharge 
 event if discharges are intermittent. The flow shall be measured in 
 gallons per minute (gpm). The flow measurements, the number of 
 discharge events, and the duration of each discharge event shall be 
 reported in the Annual DMR for each day of the mining season. 

2. Suction Dredges. a. Suction Dredge operations shall visually monitor for turbidity as 
 described in Part II.C. once per day of operation. The Permittee 
 shall maintain records of all information resulting from any visual 
 inspections. 
 
b. The Permittee will report the period of suction dredging on the 
 DMR. Visual violation occurrences will also be reported on the 
 DMR along with the measures taken to comply with the provisions 
 of Permit Part II.C.3. 



III. Management Practices 



 A. Mechanical Operations and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden 



1. The flow of surface waters (i.e., creek, river, or stream) into the plant 
 site shall be interrupted and these waters diverted around and away to 
 prevent incursion into the plant site. 

2. Berms, including any pond walls, dikes, low dams, and similar water 
 retention structures shall be constructed in a manner such that they are 
 reasonably expected to reject the passage of water. 

3. Measures shall be taken to assure that pollutant materials removed 
 from the process water and wastewater streams will be retained in 
 storage areas and not discharged or released to the waters of the 
 United States. 

4. The amount of new water allowed to enter the plant site for use in 
 material processing shall be limited to the minimum amount required as 
 makeup water for processing operations. 

5. All water control devices such as diversion structures and berms and all 
 solids retention structures such as berms, dikes, pond structures, and 
 dams shall be maintained to continue their effectiveness and to protect 
 from failure. 

6. The operator shall take whatever reasonable steps are appropriate to 
 assure that, after the mining season, all mine areas, including ponds, 
 are in a condition which will not cause additional degradation to the 
 receiving waters over those resulting from natural causes. 



B. Suction Dredges 



1. Dredging in waters of the United States is permitted only within the 
 active stream channel. 

2. Wherever practicable, the dredge shall be set to discharge into a quiet 
 pool, where settling of dredge spoils can occur more rapidly. 

3. Care shall be taken by the operator during refueling of the dredge to 
 prevent spillage into public waters or to groundwater. 

4. Dredging is not permitted during the periods that fish eggs could be in 
 the gravel at the dredge site and harassment of fish in the stream is 
 prohibited. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, 
 Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State 
 which require a Habitat permit from the Alaska Department of Fish and 
 Game. 



C. Other Requirements_Mechanical Operations and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden 



The operator shall maintain fuel handling and storage facilities in a manner 
 which will prevent the discharge of fuel oil into the receiving waters or on 
 the adjoining shoreline. A Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure 
 Plan (SPCC Plan) shall be prepared and updated as necessary in 
 accordance with provisions of 40 CFR part 112 for facilities storing 660 
 gallons in a single container above ground, 1,320 gallons in the aggregate 
 above ground, or 42,000 gallons below ground. 

The permittee shall indicate on the DMR if an SPCC Plan is necessary and 
 in place at the site and if changes were made to the Plan over the previous 
 year.

D. Storm Exemption 



The permittee may qualify for a storm exemption from the technology-based effluent limitations in Part II.A.1.b.
of this NPDES general permit if the following conditions are met: 

1. The treatment system is designed, constructed and maintained to contain the maximum volume of untreated process
wastewater which would be discharged, stored, contained and used or recycled by the beneficiation process into the
treatment system during a 4-hour operating period without an increase in volume from precipitation or infiltration,
plus the maximum volume of water runoff (drainage waters) resulting from a 5-year, 6-hour precipitation event. In
computing the maximum volume of water which would result from a 5-year, 6-hour precipitation event, the operator
must include the volume which should result from the plant site contributing runoff to the individual treatment facility.


2. The operator takes all reasonable steps to maintain treatment of the wastewater and minimize the amount of overflow.


3. The source is in compliance with the Best Management Practices in Part III.A. of this permit. 

4. The operator complies with the notification requirements of Parts IV.G. and H. of this permit. 



IV. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 



A. Representative Sampling 



All samples for monitoring purposes shall be representative of the monitored activity, 40 CFR 122.41 (j). To determine
compliance with permit effluent limitations, ``grab'' samples shall be taken as established under Part II.D. of
this permit. Specifically, effluent samples for settleable solids, turbidity, and arsenic shall be collected from
the settling pond or other treatment systems outlet prior to discharge to the receiving stream. Additionally, turbidity
samples shall also be taken above the discharge point at a location that is representative of the receiving stream.
Samples for arsenic and turbidity monitoring must be taken during sluicing at a time when the operation has reached
equilibrium. For example, samples should be taken when sluice paydirt loading and effluent discharge are constant.




B. Reporting of Monitoring Results



Monitoring results shall be summarized each month and reported on EPA Form 3320-1 (DMR). The DMR shall be submitted
to the Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Enforcement Section WD-135, Seattle,
Washington 98101-3188, no later than November 30 each year. 

If there is no mining activity during the year or no wastewater discharge to a receiving stream, the permittee shall
notify EPA of these facts no later than November 30 of each year. 

The DMR shall also be sent to the regional office of ADEC that has jurisdiction over the mine. The addresses can be found
in permit part I.E.3. 



C. Monitoring Procedures



Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures approved under 40 CFR part 136, unless other test procedures
have been specified in this permit. 



D. Additional Monitoring by the Permittee



If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by this permit, using test procedures approved
under 40 CFR part 136 or as specified in this permit, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the calculation
and reporting of the data submitted in the DMR. Such increased frequency shall also be indicated.

 3. Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including 
 monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations regulated 
 or required under this permit; and 
 4. Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purpose of assuring 
 permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Act, any 
 substances or parameters at any location. 



V. Compliance Responsibilities 



A. Duty to Comply 



The permittee must comply with all conditions of this 
 permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is 
 grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and 
 reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application. 
 The permittee shall give advance notice to the Director and ADEC of any 
 planned changes in the permitted facility or activity which may result in 
 noncompliance with permit requirements. 



B. Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions 



1. Administrative Penalty. The Act provides that any person who violates a 
 permit condition implementing sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or

Except as provided in permit conditions in Part V.G., Bypass of Treatment 
 Facilities and Part V.H., Upset Conditions, nothing in this permit shall be 
 construed to relieve the permittee of the civil or criminal penalties for 
 noncompliance. 
 


C. Need to Halt or Reduce Activity not a Defense 



It shall not be a defense 
 for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary 
 to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with 
 the conditions of this permit. 


D. Duty to Mitigate 



The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize 
 or prevent any discharge in violation of this permit which has a reasonable 
 likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment. 


E. Proper Operation and Maintenance 



The permittee shall at all times 
 properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and 
 control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the 
 permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper 
 operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls and 
 appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the 
 operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems which are 
 installed by a permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve 
 compliance with the conditions of the permit. 


F. Removed Substances 



Solids, sludges, or other pollutants removed in the 
 course of treatment or control of wastewaters shall be disposed of in a 
 manner so as to prevent any pollutant from such materials from entering 
 waters of the United States.

G. Bypass of Treatment Facilities



1. Bypass not exceeding limitations. The permittee may allow any bypass 
 to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but 
 only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. 
 These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 
 3 of this section. 

2. Notice: 

a. Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance of the need 
 for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least 10 days 
 before the date of the bypass. 

b. Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit notice of an 
 unanticipated bypass as required under Part III.G., Notice of 
 Noncompliance Reporting. 

3. Prohibition of bypass. 

a. Bypass is prohibited and the Director or ADEC may take 
 enforcement action against a permittee for a bypass, unless: 
(1) The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal 
 injury, or severe property damage; 

(2) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the 
 use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated 
 wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment 
 downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up 
 equipment should have been installed in the exercise of 
 reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which 
 occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or 
 preventive maintenance; and 

(3) The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph 2 
 of this section. 

b. The Director and ADEC may approve an anticipated bypass, after 
 considering its adverse effects, if the Director and ADEC determine 
 that it will meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph 3.a. 
 of this section. 



H. Upset Conditions 



1. Effect of an upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an 
 action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit 
 effluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this section are 
 met. An administrative review of a claim that noncompliance was 
 caused by an upset does not represent final administrative action for 
 any specific event. A determination is not final until formal 
 administrative action is taken for the specific violation(s). 

2. Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A permittee who 
 wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, 
 through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other 
 relevant evidence that: 

a. An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) 
 of the upset; 

b. The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; 

c. The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required under Part 
 IV.G., Notice of Noncompliance Reporting; and 

d. The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under 
 Part V.D., Duty to Mitigate. 

3. Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking 
 to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof. 


I. Toxic Pollutants 



The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or 
 prohibitions established under section 307(a) of the Act for toxic pollutants 
 within the time provided in the regulations that establish those standards or 
 prohibitions, even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the 
 requirement. 



VI. General Requirements 



A. Changes in Discharge of Toxic Substances



Notification shall be 
 provided to the Director and ADEC as soon as the permittee knows of, or 
 has reason to believe: 

1. That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result in the 
 discharge, on a routine or frequent basis, of any toxic pollutant which is 
 not limited in the permit, if that discharge will exceed the highest of the 
 following ``notification levels'':

a. One hundred micrograms per liter (100  u g/l); 

b. Two hundred micrograms per liter (200  u g/l) for acrolein and 
 acrylonitrile; five hundred micrograms per liter (500  u g/l) for 
 2,4-dinitrophenol and for 2-methyl-4, 6-dinitrophenol; and one 
 milligram per liter (1 mg/l) for antimony; 

c. Five (5) times the maximum concentration value reported for that 
 pollutant in the permit application in accordance with 40 CFR 
 122.21(g)(7); or 

d. The level established by the Director in accordance with 
 40 CFR 122.44(f). 

2. That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result in any 
 discharge, on a non-routine or infrequent basis, of a toxic pollutant 
 which is not limited in the permit, if that discharge will exceed the 
 highest of the following ``notification levels'': 

a. Five hundred micrograms per liter (500  u g/l); 

b. One milligram per liter (1 mg/l) for antimony; 

c. Ten (10) times the maximum concentration value reported for that 
 pollutant in the permit application in accordance with 40 CFR 
 122.21(g)(7); or 

d. The level established by the Director in accordance with 
 40 CFR 122.44(f). 



B. Planned Changes



The permittee shall give notice to the Director and 
 ADEC as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions 
 to the permitted facility. Notice is required only when: 

1. The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the 
 criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source as determined 
 in 40 CFR 122.29(b); or 

2. The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or 
 increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This notification applies 
 to pollutants which are subject neither to effluent limitations in the 
 permit, nor to notification requirements under part VI.A.1. 



C. Anticipated Noncompliance



The permittee shall also give advance notice 
 to the Director and ADEC of any planned changes in the permitted facility 
 or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements. 



D. Permit Actions



This permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or 
 terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit 
 modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of 
 planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit 
 condition. 



E. Duty to Reapply



If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated 
 by this permit after the expiration date of this permit, the permittee must 
 apply for and obtain a new permit. The application should be submitted at 
 least 180 days before the expiration date of this permit. 



F. Duty to Provide Information



The permittee shall furnish to the Director 
 and ADEC, within a reasonable time, any information which the Director or 
 ADEC may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, 
 revoking and reissuing, or terminating this permit, or to determine 
 compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Director 
 or ADEC, upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this 
 permit. 



G. Other Information



When the permittee becomes aware that it failed to 
 submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or submitted incorrect 
 information in a permit application or any report to the Director or ADEC, it 
 shall promptly submit such facts or information. 



H. Signatory Requirements



All applications, reports or information submitted 
 to the Director and ADEC shall be signed and certified. 

1. All permit applications shall be signed as follows: 

a. For a corporation: by a responsible corporate officer. 

b. For a partnership or sole proprietorship: by a g
