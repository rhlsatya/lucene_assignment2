Airworthiness Directives: Rockwell 
International/Collins Air Transport Division DME-700 
Distance Measuring Equipment 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
directive (AD) that applies to Rockwell 
International/Air Transport Division (Collins) 
DME-700 distance measuring equipment (DME) installed on 
aircraft. This action requires modifying these DME 
units to ensure they are functioning properly. Several 
reports of the affected DME units failing to process 
and update distance outputs, and reports of these units 
establishing a continuous restart mode upon power 
application prompted this AD. The actions specified by 
this AD are intended to prevent improper operation of 
this equipment, which could result in navigational 
errors. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD 
that applies to certain Collins DME-700 distance 
measurement equipment installed on aircraft was 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 25, 1993 
(58 FR 5949). The action proposed to require 
modifying these DME units to ensure that they are 
functioning properly. The proposed modifications would 
be accomplished in accordance with the following 
Collins service bulletins (SB) (1) SB 20, Revision 1, 
DME-700-34-20, dated August 30, 1991, which when 
incorporated prevents a condition known as ``sleeping 
DME's''; and (2) Collins SB 24, DME-700-34-24, dated May 
15, 1992; Collins SB 25, DME-700-34-25, dated November 
11, 1992; and Collins SB 26, DME-700-34-26, dated 
October 21, 1992, as applicable, which when 
incorporated prevent a condition known as ``deaf DME's''. 


Interested persons have been afforded an 
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
amendment. Based on the comments received, the 
proposal was changed to add a modification that went 
beyond the scope of that which was originally proposed. 
Accordingly, the FAA issued a supplementary NPRM 
that incorporated minor revisions and added the 
additional modification. The proposed actions 
specified in the Supplemental NPRM would be 
accomplished in accordance with the following, as 
applicable:

Interested persons were again afforded an 
opportunity to comment on the proposed action. Due 
consideration has been given to the five comments 
received. 
Two commenters concur with the proposed rule as 
written. 
Another commenter (Collins) states that there are 
two errors in the part numbers referenced in the 
proposed AD: (1) part number (P/N) 
622-4540-022 was referenced as P/N 622-4540-22 in the 
Applicability section of the AD; and (2) in the chart 
in paragraph (c) of the proposed AD, the sentence that 
consists of the following words: ``All applicable DME-700 Units, Converts -022, -021, or -022
to -023.'' should be changed to ``All applicable DME-700 Units, Converts -020, -021, or -022
to -023.'' The FAA 
concurs and has changed the proposed AD accordingly. 
One commenter reports that the Airbus Model A330 
airplane is not yet certificated, and should not be 
included in the list of affected airplane models. The 
FAA concurs that this airplane is not certificated and 
has deleted it from the list of possible affected 
airplanes. However, the Applicability section of the 
proposed AD is worded as ``DME equipment that is 
installed on, but not limited to, the following model 
airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any 
category:''. If this airplane would become 
certificated for operation with the Collins DME-700 
equipment, then this action would apply to these 
airplanes.

Another commenter states that these DME units were 
never certificated on Boeing Model B757 airplanes, and 
should therefore be removed from the applicability of 
the proposed AD. The FAA concurs and has revised the 
proposed AD accordingly. 
This same commenter suggests several minor 
editorial revisions and corrections to increase the 
understanding of the proposed AD. The FAA concurs that 
these changes would improve clarity and has revised the 
proposed AD accordingly. 
After careful review of all available information 
including the comments noted above, the FAA has 
determined that air safety and the public interest 
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for 
the changes referenced above and minor editorial 
corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes 
and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD 
nor add any additional burden upon the public than was 
already proposed. 
The condition specified by the required action is 
not caused by actual hours time-in-service (TIS) of the 
airplane that the equipment is installed in. There is 
no correlation between improper operation of the 
equipment and the age or number of times the equipment 
is utilized. Based on this, the compliance time of 
this AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours 
TIS. 
The FAA estimates that 518 DME-700 units installed 
on airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by 
this AD, that it will take approximately 7 workhours 
per unit to accomplish the required action, and that 
the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. 
Parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost 
to the owner/operator. Based on these figures, the 
total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is 
estimated to be $199,430. This cost figure is based on 
the assumption that none of the affected airplane 
owners/operators have accomplished the required action. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) 
will not have a significant economic impact, positive 
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action 
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location 
provided under the caption ``

Delegation of Authority To Accept Checks and Waive 
Penalties 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Treasury decision, final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Authority delegation. This Treasury decision 
expands the responsibilities of the ``Chief, Tax Processing 
Center'' by giving the chief the authority to accept checks 
and waive penalties. It also removes certain regulations 
dealing with tax collection activities under 27 CFR part 
70 that have been determined to be outside of the 
authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On July 1, 1972, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms (ATF) was established by Treasury Department 
Order No. 120-01 (formerly Order No. 221). This Order 
transferred from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the 
newly-formed Bureau the functions, powers and duties 
relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives 
laws. The Order specifically stated that ``all existing 
activities relating to the collection, processing, 
depositing, or accounting for taxes * * * shall continue 
to be performed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to 
the extent not now performed by the Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms Division * * * until the Director shall otherwise 
provide with the approval of the Secretary.'' ATF assumed 
responsibility for the collection of taxes imposed by 
subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code in July 1987, by 
means of Treasury Decision (T.D.) ATF-251, and adopted 
provisions in 27 CFR part 70 similar to those found in 26 
CFR part 301 which concerned the deposit and assessment of 
taxes. The remaining collection functions with respect to 
taxes administered by ATF were transferred by way of T.D. 
ATF-301, at which time ATF adopted regulations similar to 
those used by IRS relating to the examination, assessment, 
and collection functions. These provisions are also found 
in 27 CFR part 70. Under existing regulations, the 
regional directors (compliance) are authorized to accept 
checks and waive penalties associated with the collection 
of taxes administered by ATF. This final rule amends 
27 CFR part 70 by vesting the authority to accept checks 
and waive penalties with the Chief, Tax Processing Center, 
in addition to the regional directors (compliance), in 
order to ease the burden on the regional directors 
(compliance), simplify the waiver process for taxpayers, 
and permit the more efficient functioning of ATF's tax 
collection activities. 

This final rule also removes the following 
regulations dealing with tax collection activities that 
have been determined to fall outside of ATF's authority: 
27 CFR 70.166(a), 70.201, 70.211, 70.212 and 70.487. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980, Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to 
this final rule because no requirement to collect 
information is imposed. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
relating to a final regulatory flexibility analysis 
(5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rule 
because the agency was not required to publish a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any 
other law. A copy of this final rule was submitted to the 
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 7805(f). No 
comments were received. 



Executive Order 12866 



It has been determined that this rule is not a 
significant regulatory action, because (1) it will not 
have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, 
the environment, public health or safety, or State, local 
or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious 
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the 
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or 
loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising 
out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the 
principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. 



Administrative Procedures Act 



Because this final rule is a rule of agency 
management that merely transfers the authority relating to 
the acceptance of checks and waiver of penalties, it is 
unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision with notice 
and public procedure thereon under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2) and 
(b)(B) or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 
U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Genitourinary System Disabilities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulation. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its Schedule for Rating Disabilities of the Genitourinary System.
This amendment is based on a General Accounting Office (GAO) study noting that there has been no comprehensive review
of the rating schedule since 1945, and recommending that such a review be conducted. The effect of this action is to
update the genitourinary portion of the rating schedule to ensure that it uses current medical terminology, unambiguous
criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In December 1988, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recommended that VA prepare a plan for a comprehensive review
of the rating schedule and, based on the results, revise the medical criteria accordingly. As part of the process to
implement these recommendations, VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 4.115 and 4.115a in the 

Federal Register

 of December 2, 1991 (56 FR 61216-20). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections on or before January 2, 1992. We received comments from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American
Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and VA employees. 



We have made a number of editorial changes, primarily of syntax and punctuation, throughout the final rule. These
changes are intended to clarify the rating criteria and represent no substantive amendment. Generic terms such as
``severe,'' ``moderate,'' and ``mild,'' which preceded various evaluation criteria in the proposed regulations,
have been removed. Rather than helping to explain or clarify the specific evaluation criteria which they precede,
these terms inject an element of ambiguity not otherwise present. Under diagnostic code 7524, we have deleted the
phrase ``other than undescended or congenitally undeveloped'' for the noncompensable evaluation criteria since
the NOTE following adequately explains that an undescended or congenitally undeveloped testis is not ratable.

We proposed that  4.115 be amended to allow separate evaluation of coexisting ``heart disease'' in the event
of an absent kidney, or when chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required.
One commenter pointed out that in addition to heart disease, hypertension is often manifested in cases of renal disease,
but that the proposed regulatory language would preclude a separate evaluation for hypertension. He suggested that
we substitute the term ``cardiovascular disease'' for ``heart disease.'' Although we agree that this provision
should apply to hypertension as well as heart disease, we believe that the term ``cardiovascular'' is too broad since
it might be interpreted to include cardiovascular conditions unrelated to renal dysfunction. We have therefore
amended  4.115 to specify that coexisting heart disease or hypertension may be separately evaluated in the
absence of one kidney or when the claimant requires dialysis. 

Our proposed rating formula for renal dysfunction under  4.115a included a requirement at the 100 percent level
for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds of more than 100mg% and 10mg%, respectively. One commenter
felt that the proposed requirements are too high and suggested that 80mg% and 8mg% would be more appropriate. Upon
further review, we have concluded that measurements over 80/8mg% suggest a need for dialysis and would therefore
be a more appropriate threshold. We have accordingly amended the criteria for a 100 percent evaluation in  4.115a.
In keeping with that change, we have also amended the ranges of BUN and creatinine readings required for an 80 percent
evaluation to 40-80mg% and 4-8mg%, respectively. 

Two commenters felt that the word ``invalidism'' in the proposed criteria for the 100 and 80 percent levels for renal
dysfunction is inappropriate because it is archaic, too subjective, and in fact suggests a level of severity more
consistent with entitlement to special monthly compensation. VA agrees, and has substituted the phrase ``precluding
more than sedentary activity'' for the 100 percent evaluation, and the phrase ``generalized poor health characterized
by * * *'' for the 80 percent evaluation. 

Under the 60 percent evaluation level for renal dysfunction, we had proposed that qualifying manifestations of hypertension
be referred to as ``moderate hypertension'' whereas under the 30 percent level we had proposed that hypertension
be ``minimally compensable under diagnostic code 7101.'' One commenter recommended that hypertension be described
consistently in terms of diagnostic code 7101 throughout the criteria for renal dysfunction. We agree. Such a change
would promote not only a clearer understanding of the rule, but internal consistency within the rating schedule as
well. We have therefore modified the criteria for a 60 percent evaluation to require hypertension at least 40 percent
disabling under diagnostic code 7101, for a 30 percent evaluation to require hypertension at least 10 percent disabling
under diagnostic code 7101, and the zero percent evaluation to include hypertension non-compensable under diagnostic
code 7101. 

One commenter felt that either albumin and casts with a history of acute nephritis or renal dysfunction with mild hypertension
warrants a 10 percent evaluation rather than the zero percent we had proposed under the criteria for renal dysfunction.
We do not concur. Albuminuria and granular casts are clinical findings which may or may not indicate active kidney
disease, but which themselves are not inherently disabling. Since the level of compensation is determined primarily
by the extent to which a condition is disabling, and since an asymptomatic condition, or combination of asymptomatic
conditions, imposing no discernible industrial impairment does not warrant a compensable evaluation, we find no
reason to assign these conditions a compensable evaluation in the absence of chronic kidney disease or hypertension
which is compensable under diagnostic code 7101. 

Two commenters questioned the reduction of the evaluation for loss of a single kidney from 30 percent to zero percent
disabling. Although long-term renal function returns to near normal due to hypertrophy of the remaining kidney,
the significant anatomical alteration caused by removal of a 
kidney, the resulting surgical scar, and the precautions which must be taken to protect the remaining kidney, could
reasonably be expected to prevent a veteran from engaging in certain, but by no means all, occupations. Upon further
reconsideration, we have therefore elected to retain the minimum 30 percent evaluation for loss of a single kidney
under diagnostic code 7500. 

One commenter felt that the proposed criteria for rating voiding dysfunction under  4.115a would be inadequate
for evaluating veterans with neurogenic bladders who use either indwelling or intermittent catheterization to
void, and suggested a separate diagnostic code for neurogenic bladder. Although a need for separate rating criteria
was implied, the commenter offered no alternative criteria for our consideration. 

VA agrees that it would be useful to have a separate diagnostic code for this disability, which is common in cases of
severe spinal cord injury. We have therefore added diagnostic code 7542 for neurogenic bladder with instructions
to rate the condition under the criteria for voiding dysfunction, which we believe are adequate to evaluate neurogenic
bladder. Neurogenic bladder is manifested as urine leakage or frequent urination, both of which correspond to categories
of voiding dysfunction as proposed. In addition, the word ``appliance'' as used in the criteria for incontinence
clearly includes all types of catheters as well as any other assistive device for urination.

Under the general rating criteria for urinary frequency in  4.115a, we had proposed separate sets of evaluation
criteria for daytime and nighttime frequency. The criteria for daytime frequency were assigned evaluations of 40,
20, and 10 percent. For nighttime frequency, awakening to void five or more times per night was proposed as 20 percent,
awakening to void three to four times was assigned 10 percent, and one to two times was non-compensable. One commenter
felt that the evaluations for nighttime frequency should be higher than proposed, while another believed that the
distinction between daytime and nighttime frequency is artificial and should be eliminated. 

Separate criteria for nighttime frequency were proposed since a patient may be more likely to report this symptom
to an examining physician, especially in the early stages of renal disease. Upon further review, however, VA agrees
that nighttime frequency is just as indicative of significant disease as daytime frequency, and that different evaluation
levels are not warranted. We have therefore incorporated the three levels originally proposed for nighttime frequency
with the 40, 20, and 10 percent levels under daytime frequency. Instances in which a person is awakened to void only
once a night, however, have not been made compensable, since this degree of frequency does not, in our judgment, impose
a disability significant enough to warrant the payment of compensation. 

One commenter felt that the frequency of the need to change absorbent materials under the criteria for rating voiding
dysfunction is not a useful measure of incontinence because: (1) The changing of absorbent materials does not accurately
quantify the degree of disability, (2) the wearing of absorbent materials may be inappropriate for paraplegics,
and (3) there is no objective method to determine the frequency of the need to change absorbent materials. 

We do not concur. A person who needs to change absorbent materials often has a greater loss of voluntary control than
one who needs changes less frequently. The frequency of changes can be objectively reported either by the veteran
or the person providing care, with the frequency of the need for such changes determined by an examining physician.
These criteria represent, in our judgment, a satisfactory means to measure urinary incontinence and, since no reasonable
alternative has been suggested, we have elected to retain them. For some persons, wearing absorbent materials may
be inappropriate; such people require the use of a catheter or some other means to compensate for the loss of control.
As previously discussed, the criteria at the 60 percent level addressing the use of such an appliance are adequate
to evaluate the disabilities of those for whom the use of absorbent materials is inappropriate.

One commenter remarked that the words ``increased to the next higher'' were unclear in the instruction for arteriolar
nephrosclerosis following diagnostic code 7507. We agree that this language, which was retained from the prior rating
schedule, is ambiguous. The intended effect is to recognize that heart disease or hypertension is more serious when
the claimant also has renal disabilities. We have amended the instruction following diagnostic code 7507 to clarify
this principle. 

Under the diagnostic codes for nephrolithiasis (7508), ureterolithiasis (7510), and stricture of the ureter (7511),
a 30 percent evaluation was proposed for recurrent stone formation requiring diet therapy, drug therapy, or frequent
surgical therapy. One commenter believed a higher evaluation should be assigned for ``frequent surgical therapy,''
since frequent surgery implies a condition more severe than one controlled through diet or drug therapy. By ``surgical
therapy'' we meant to include extraction through a catheter or fragmentation through such means as extracorporeal
shock wave lithotripsy. To remove any ambiguity and thus avoid confusion, we have amended the criteria under diagnostic
codes 7508, 7510, and 7511 to refer to ``invasive or non-invasive procedures'' rather than ``surgical therapy,''
and we have replaced the term ``frequent'' with the more objective measurement of more than twice per year. 

One commenter stated that the words ``multiple urethroperineal'' in the evaluation criteria for fistula of the urethra
(7519) were unclear. Once again, we agree that a term retained from the prior rating schedule is vague and potentially
confusing. We have added the word ``fistulae'' to indicate that when there are two or more fistulous tracts draining
from the perineum a 100 percent evaluation will be assigned. 

Under diagnostic code 7531 (kidney transplants), we originally proposed that a follow-up examination be conducted
six months after surgery in the same manner as for malignancies (diagnostic code 7528). Diagnostic code 7531 previously
required assignment of a 100 percent evaluation with a prospective reduction two years after surgery. Three commenters
stated that a period longer than six months is warranted because of the fragile condition of these patients, the complications
of surgery, the side-effects of immunosuppressive therapy, and the risk of transplant rejection. One commenter
suggested that a one year period would be reasonable. 

Considering the possibility of late immunologic, medical, and surgical complications, we believe it is more reasonable
to assess residual disability one year after surgery instead of six months. We have therefore amended the NOTE following
diagnostic code 7531 to state that a mandatory VA examination will be conducted one year after hospital discharge
instead of the six months originally proposed. 

A minimum rating of 30 percent was proposed under the diagnostic code for kidney transplant for as long as a patient
is on immunosuppressive medication. One commenter stated that almost all persons who have undergone transplant
surgery permanently require immunosuppressive medication. Upon further review, VA agrees that it is so seldom that
immunosuppressive therapy can be stopped after transplantation, that the proposed exception to the minimum evaluation
under diagnostic code 7531 is not necessary. We have deleted that exception from the final rule. 

One commenter believed that there should be an evaluation level of 30 percent in addition to the 20 percent level proposed
under diagnostic code 7532, Renal tubular dysfunctions, since various renal tubular nephropathies may have severe
disabling effects. Another commenter suggested that the category of renal tubular dysfunctions was too vague and
seemed to embrace a variety of conditions which should be singly listed, and that they often render veterans unemployable
due to the combination of treatment and symptoms. 

Renal tubular disorders include disorders of the proximal nephron function, disorders of function of the ascending
limb of the loop of Henle, and disorders of distal nephron function. We have amended the parenthetical portion of the
heading of diagnostic code 7532 to include additional examples of these diseases, which have common characteristics
and should therefore be rated under the same criteria to ensure consistency. These conditions generally cause metabolic
imbalances which can be adequately treated by replacement therapy; as such, in our judgment, they do not warrant an
evaluation greater than 20 percent. They may on occasion, however, result in more severe kidney dysfunction. For
that reason we have added an instruction to alternatively rate this disability as renal dysfunction, which will allow
evaluations greater than 20 percent. 

One commenter stated that in keeping with ``current BVA [Board of Veterans Appeals] policy,'' the diagnostic code
for penile deformity with loss of erectile power (7522) should provide a 20 percent evaluation even when erectile
power has been restored by means of a penile implant.

VA does not concur. Under diagnostic code 7522, two distinct elements are required for a 20 percent evaluation: (1)
Penile deformity and (2) loss of erectile power. If either element is absent following insertion of a penile implant
or for any other reason the criteria for a 20 percent evaluation under this code are not met, and the instruction which
the commenter requests is therefore not warranted. VA regulations are binding upon all agencies within the Department
of Veterans Affairs, and neither BVA nor any other VA agency is free to adopt an official policy which is contrary to
established regulations. 

The same commenter also requested that we add a NOTE to diagnostic code 7522 indicating entitlement to special monthly
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). 

Although loss of erectile power establishes entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k),
we do not believe that a NOTE to such effect in the rating schedule is warranted. The criteria regarding entitlement
to special monthly compensation are extensive, very complicated, and seldom correspond exactly to evaluation criteria
in the rating schedule. For that reason, it is important that raters refer to the regulations governing special monthly
compensation rather than relying on cross-references in the rating schedule. 

One commenter objected to the proposed elimination of a compensable evaluation for loss of a single testicle under
diagnostic code 7524, alleging that such loss disrupts normal endocrine function and interferes with the maintenance
of secondary sex characteristics. VA does not concur. In fact, any retrogressive changes in secondary sex characteristics
even following removal of both testes after sexual maturity would occur slowly, if at all (Oswald S. Lowsley and T.J.
Kirwin, ``Clinical Urology'' 230 (Williams and Wilkins 1956)). A solitary testis is in most cases adequate to sustain
normal endocrine function without hormone replacement therapy. No significant employment handicap would likely
result from this condition and a compensable evaluation, in our judgment, is not warranted. 

The same commenter objected to the proposed elimination of the minimum rating of 20 percent for removal of the prostate
gland (diagnostic code 7526). VA does not concur. Because of the development of improved surgical techniques for
extraction of the prostate through the perineum, bladder, surrounding capsule, or urethra, a minimum disability
evaluation of 20 percent is not warranted. Often the only residual of this surgery is sterility, which is compensated
not under the rating schedule but by means of special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k). Should any other
disability result, it would be rated under the diagnostic code for injuries, infections, hypertrophy, and postoperative
residuals of the prostate gland (7527), with evaluations based on the criteria for voiding dysfunction or urinary
tract infections. In our judgment, this provision allows for a broad enough range of evaluations to rate residual
disability as established by medical examination. 

Three commenters urged that the previous convalescent period of one year following cancer treatment (diagnostic
code 7528) be retained, stating that the complexity of certain medical procedures, the wide variety of possible side-effects,
and the time required to recover from treatment precludes any realistic reduction of these recuperative periods.


The commenters appear to have misinterpreted the proposed rule to mean that a convalescent evaluation will terminate
after six months. The rule actually requires an examination, not a reduction, six months after the assignment of total
benefits. If the claimant remains totally disabled, the 100 percent evaluation will continue without interruption.
If a reduction in evaluation is warranted, it will be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). 

This application of total convalescence evaluations will take into account the wide array of possible side-effects
and complications of treatment by ensuring that any changes in evaluation are supported by the specific findings
of a current medical examination. A total evaluation will extend indefinitely after treatment is discontinued,
with a required VA examination six months thereafter. If the results of this or any subsequent examination warrant
a reduction in evaluation, the reduction will be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). There can be
no reduction at the end of six months since any proposed reduction would be based on the examination and the notification
process can begin only after the examination is reviewed. This method also has the advantage of offering the veteran
more contemporary notice 
of any proposed action and, under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e), expanding the opportunity to present evidence
showing that the proposed action should not be taken. We have revised the wording of the NOTE based upon the concerns
of the commenters, however, to ensure that it cannot be misinterpreted as requiring a reduction six months after treatment
is terminated.

Several commenters objected to the elimination of a minimum 10 percent evaluation following treatment of cancer
under diagnostic code 7528. One commenter stated that malignancies of this kind result in a ``permanent mental fixation.''
Another commenter stated that there may be residual damage to the genitourinary system from radiation treatment.

VA acknowledges that disability often follows cancer treatment, and residual impairment of the genitourinary system
will accordingly be rated as either voiding or renal dysfunction. Although any residual warranting compensation
would be ascertainable on VA examination, the existence of such residuals cannot be presumed in every case. Psychiatric
or any other complications are subject to service connection under 38 CFR 3.310(a) of this chapter. The recurrence
of cancer at any time would warrant restoration of the 100 percent evaluation. Rating the actual residuals will in
our judgment allow assignment of an evaluation reflecting the true severity of the individual disability. 
One commenter stated that because the proposed amendments included reductions in certain percentage evaluations,
VA was exceeding the GAO mandate to review the rating schedule for the purpose of updating medical terminology and
evaluation criteria. 
VA does not concur. VA's mandate to review the rating schedule derives from the statutory authority which Congress
has granted the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adopt a schedule of ratings, including the authority to establish
percentage evaluations (38 U.S.C. 1155). Although GAO may recommend that the Secretary review the schedule from
a particular perspective, it has no authority to limit the scope of any review which the Secretary subsequently conducts
under that statutory authority. The GAO recommendations resulted from a study finding that the rating schedule uses
outdated medical terminology, contains ambiguous rating criteria, and does not reflect recent medical advances.
If it is to conduct a good faith review, particularly when considering medical advances, VA cannot preclude the possibility
that some evaluations may be changed. Congress, in fact, specifically foresaw such a possibility when it enacted
legislation to amend 38 U.S.C. 1155 in order to protect the level of evaluations assigned under superseded rating
criteria. (See 137 Cong. Rec. H5928 (daily ed. July 29, 1991) (statement of Rep. Montgomery).)

One commenter implied that the proposed changes could not be made without statistical studies showing the economic
impact of genitourinary impairments on disabled individuals. He cited a statistical study conducted in the 1960s
which he contends does not support the proposed reductions. 
The statute authorizing establishment of the schedule directs that ``[t]he Secretary shall from time to time readjust
the schedule of ratings 

in accordance with experience

'' (emphasis supplied). Rather than requiring statistical studies or any other specific type of data, the statute
clearly leaves the nature of the experience which warrants an adjustment, and by extension the manner in which any
review is conducted, to the discretion of the Secretary. Although during the 1970s VA considered adjusting the rating
schedule based on the same statistical studies cited by the commenter, that approach proved to be unsatisfactory
and the proposed changes were not adopted. 
To allow as much public participation in the process as possible, we published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on August 21, 1989 (54 FR 34531-2). We received responses from VA employees, the Naval Physical Evaluation Board,
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Director of Urology Programs at the National Institutes
of Health, and the general public. We also contracted with an outside consultant to suggest revisions. In formulating
recommendations, the consultant convened a five-member panel of physicians, each specializing in a different aspect
of urology. We developed our proposed changes only after reviewing all of the material received in response to the
ANPRM, from the consultant, and from specialists from the Veterans Health Administration in renal diseases. 
One commenter believed that the proposed changes did not reflect the average person's ability to cope with genitourinary
disorders as 38 U.S.C. 1155 requires, but were instead based upon optimum success in overcoming the effects of disease
and the results of surgery. Presumably the commenter was referring to the convalescent periods specified under various
diagnostic codes in this portion of the schedule. 
VA does not concur. 38 U.S.C. 1155 directs that ``ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments
of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.'' The word ``average,'' as used in the statute,
refers to the ``usual or normal kind, amount, quality, rate, etc.'' (``Webster's New World Dictionary,'' Third College
Edition). We have outlined above the range of medical advice available to us when we conducted this review. The convalescent
periods adopted in this change represent in our judgment, based on sound medical advice, neither the longest nor shortest
periods that any individual patient might require for recovery, but the usual or normal periods during which a normal
patient, under normal circumstances, would be expected to recover from a specific condition or surgical procedure.
We also note that these convalescent periods represent the point at which the individual patient's condition is to
be evaluated by examination, and do not preclude an extension of a total evaluation if appropriate based on the individual
patient's condition. (See comments regarding diagnostic code 7528.) 
Another commenter believed that certain changes were proposed ``with an eye towards cost cutting.'' As discussed
above, the revisions were proposed based on medical considerations; no cost studies or projections were conducted
in conjunction with this review. Cost cutting therefore was not an issue, and we believe that these revisions will
prove to have negligible budget impact. 
One commenter stated that VA should consider the effects of genitourinary conditions on life expectancy when revising
this portion of the rating schedule. 
VA does not concur. To consider a factor so far removed from ``the average impairments of earning capacity'' as the
effects of various conditions on life expectancy would clearly exceed the parameters established by Congress in
38 U.S.C. 1155.

One commenter contended that it would be unfair for VA to reduce any of the evaluations in the current rating schedule
because doing so could prevent some veterans from maintaining their current levels of evaluation and thereby deprive
them of the protection which would otherwise attach to those evaluation levels after 20 years under the provisions
of 38 U.S.C. 110. 
VA does not concur. In section 103(a) of the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-86),
Congress modified 38 U.S.C. 1155 to provide that a readjustment to the rating schedule will not result in a reduction
of any disability evaluation in effect on the date of the readjustment unless that disability has actually improved.
The statute effectively protects against the situation which the commenter anticipates. Since no evaluation may
be reduced solely due to a readjustment to the rating schedule, a readjustment cannot compromise the potential for
any veteran to have an evaluation preserved under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 110. 
One commenter suggested that VA allow special monthly compensation at the level for aid and attendance whenever a
veteran requires hemodialysis three or more times a week. Another commenter suggested that we allow special monthly
compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) for loss of a single kidney. 
VA does not concur. The entitlement criteria for special monthly compensation are established by Congress and codified
at 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) through (s). Regulations implementing these statutory grants of special monthly compensation
are found in VA's Adjudication regulations (38 CFR part 3) rather than in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38
CFR part 4). This issue is therefore beyond the scope of the current rulemaking. 
VA appreciates the comments submitted in response to the proposed rule, which is now adopted with the amendments noted
above. 
The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretary has determined that this regulatory
amendment is non-major for the following reasons: 
(1) It will not have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. 
(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices. 
(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,
or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export
markets.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, 38 CFR part 4, subpart B, is amended as set forth below:



PART 4_SCHEDULE FOR RATING DISABILITIES

Subpart B_Disability Ratings



1. The authority citation for part 4 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

72 Stat. 1125; 38 U.S.C. 1155.




2. Section 4.115 is amended by adding two sentences at the end of the section to read as follows:



 4.115



Nephritis.



* * * If, however, absence of a kidney is the sole renal disability, even if removal was required because
of nephritis, the absent kidney and any hypertension or heart disease will be separately rated. Also, in the event
that chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required, any coexisting hypertension
or heart disease will be separately rated.

3. Section 4.115a is redesignated and revised as  4.115b and a new  4.115a is added to read as follows:



 4.115a



Ratings of the genitourinary system_dysfunctions.



Diseases of the genitourinary system generally result in disabilities related to renal or voiding dysfunctions,
infections, or a combination of these. The following section provides descriptions of various levels of disability
in each of these symptom areas. Where diagnostic codes refer the decisionmaker to these specific areas dysfunction,
only the predominant area of dysfunction shall be considered for rating purposes. Since the areas of dysfunction
described below do not cover all symptoms resulting from genitourinary diseases, specific diagnoses may include

Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Dental and Oral Conditions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulation. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended that portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities which deals
with dental and oral conditions. This amendment is based on a General Accounting Office study noting that there has
been no comprehensive review of the rating schedule since 1945, and recommending that such a review be conducted.
The effect of this action is to update this portion of the rating schedule to ensure that it uses current medical terminology,
unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In December 1988, the General 
Accounting Office recommended that VA prepare a plan for a comprehensive review of the rating schedule and, based
on the results, revise the medical criteria accordingly. As part of the process to implement these recommendations,
VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 4.150 in the 

Federal Register

 of January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4961-2). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections on or before March 22, 1993. We received one comment from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 



For limited motion of the temporomandibular joint under diagnostic code 9905, we proposed evaluation criteria containing
precise ranges of limited inter-incisal motion and lateral excursion. For a 10 percent evaluation under limited
inter-incisal movement, we proposed a range of 31 to 40 millimeters. The commenter suggested that we replace this
criterion with the phrase ``any limitation of motion interfering with mastication or speech,'' which was essentially
the same requirement for a 10 percent evaluation under diagnostic code 9905 in the 1945 Rating Schedule. 

We do not concur with the suggested change. One of our goals in reviewing the rating schedule is to eliminate ambiguous
rating criteria. One means of accomplishing this is to make the criteria as objective as possible. Inter-incisal
measurements are a commonly accepted standard for objectively assessing movement of the temporomandibular joint,
and their 
use will ensure that comparable medical conditions are assigned comparable evaluations. Since the maximum inter-incisal
opening is between 40 and 60 millimeters, 31 to 40 millimeters represents the lowest range of limitation which might
interfere with mastication or speech while preserving an objective standard. For these reasons, we do not believe
any change in the proposed criteria is warranted. 

VA appreciates the comment submitted in response to the proposed rule, which is now adopted without amendment. 

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 

In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretary has determined that this regulatory
amendment is non-major for the following reasons: 

(1) It will not have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. 

(2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices. 

(3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,
or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export
markets.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Connecticut; State Order No. 7019, United Technologies
Corporation 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Connecticut. This revision
consists of Connecticut State Order No. 7019, which requires The United Technology Corporation (UTC) to limit the
operation of certain boilers, increase certain stack heights, and limit the sulfur content of fuels burned in certain
boilers, as specified in the order. This action is supported by a modeling study prepared by TRC Environmental Consultants,
Inc. in June, 1991. This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air Act.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 11, 1993, the State of Connecticut submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
SIP revision consists of State Order No. 7019.



Background


The Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies Corporation (UTC), located at Windsor Locks, CT, operates
several boilers which emit sulfur dioxide (SO

2

). On April 6, 1990, the Hamilton Standard Division received a notice of violation from the Connecticut Department
of Environmental Protection (CT DEP). Dispersion modeling done by CT DEP showed potential violations of the 3-hour
and 24-hour Connecticut Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) and National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for SO

2

. TRC Consultants, under contract to UTC, performed a subsequent dispersion modeling study to determine which actions
UTC could take to prevent these violations. In June, 1991, TRC provided a report which recommended a compliance strategy
for UTC to follow. On January 7, 1993, CT DEP issued State Order No. 7019, which requires UTC to implement this compliance
strategy.



Summary of SIP Revision


The SIP revision consists of Connecticut State Order No. 7019. The order makes certain recommendations contained
in the TRC report entitled 

Air Quality Modeling Analysis to Demonstrate SO

2

 CAAQS/NAAQS Compliance at the Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies Corporation Windsor Locks, Connecticut
Facility legally binding on UTC. These recommendations are based on modeling done by TRC in accordance with EPA and
Connecticut DEP modeling guidance. The Modeling study used the ISCST and PTMTPA-CONN models.

Under State Order No. 7019, UTC will be required to take the following actions: 



(1) Concerning the four boilers designated 518(41), 519(42), 520(43), and 521(44), not more than three (3) may be
operated simultaneously. 
(2) Boilers 519(42) and 520(43) shall burn only Natural Gas or No. 6 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 1.0%,
and boilers 518(41) and 521(44) shall burn only No. 6 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 1.0%. 
(3) Boilers 506(48) and 505(49) shall burn either natural gas or No. 4 or No. 2 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding
0.3%. 
(4) Test Cell D and Test Cell E shall be restricted to burning Jet-A fuel with sulfur content not exceeding 0.3%.
(5) The stack heights of Boilers 518(41), 519(42), 520(43), and 521(44) shall be increased to not less than 23.4 meters.




Enforcement


State Order No. 7019 contains requirements that UTC keep records of the sulfur content of each purchase of fuel, and
specifies the dates for the commencement and completion of the higher stacks required by the order. These records
will allow the state to monitor compliance. State Order No. 7019 also contains a schedule of fines which UTC must pay
if a violation occurs, as well as the name and address of the person at the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection to whom payments are to be sent.

EPA has reviewed State Order No. 7019 and has determined that the restrictions in sulfur content and the increases
in stack height are sufficient to maintain the NAAQS in the vicinity of UTC's facility in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this 

Federal Register

 notice unless, by February 17, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such
notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent
notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal
of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action
will be effective on March 21, 1994.



Final Action


EPA is approving State Order No. 7019 dated March 11, 1993 and effective in the State of Connecticut on February 19,
1993. The order is supported by a modeling study which demonstrates attainment of the NAAQS.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225).

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2). 
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.


Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Texas; Revision to the State Implementation Plan
(SIP) Addressing PM-10 for El Paso



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves a revision to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) for PM-10 in El Paso. PM-10
is defined as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers. The EPA
is also approving the PM-10 SIP for El Paso, Texas, as meeting the requirements of section 179B of the Clean Air
Act (CAA) regarding implementation plans and revisions for international border areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for PM-10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B)
and 188(a) of the CAA, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990.

1

 Please reference 56 

Federal Register

 (FR) 56694 (November 6, 1991), and 57 FR 13498 and 13537 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements for
moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts one and four of 
part D, title I of the CAA.







The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs
and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those state submittals containing moderate PM-10
nonattainment area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 
57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992).
Those moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4) of the CAA were
to submit SIPs to the EPA by November 15, 1991. The CAA outlined certain required items to be included in the SIPs. These
required items, due November 15, 1991, unless otherwise noted, include: 
(1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of PM-10 in the nonattainment
area (section 172(c)(3) of the CAA); (2) a permit program to be submitted by June 30, 1992, which meets the requirements

of section 173 for the construction and operation of new 
and modified major stationary sources of PM-10 
(section 189(a)(1)(A)); (3) a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan provides for attainment
of the PM-10 NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that
attainment by that date is impracticable (section 189(a)(1)(B)); (4) provisions to assure that Reasonably Available
Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), for control of PM-10
will be implemented no later than 
December 10, 1993 (sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). For sources emitting insignificant (de minimis) quantities
of PM-10, the EPA's policy is that it would be unreasonable and would not constitute RACM to require controls
on the source. Please reference 57 FR 13540. Also, when evaluating RACM and RACT, technological and economical feasibility
determinations are to be conducted (57 FR 13540-13544); (5) quantitative emission reduction milestones which
are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate reasonable further
progress (RFP) toward attaining the PM-10 NAAQS (section 189(c)); (6) contingency measures due November 15,
1993 (please reference 57 FR 13543), that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to make
RFP or to attain the primary standards by the applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); and (7) control requirements for
major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors, unless the EPA determines inappropriate. The CAA, in section
189(e), states that control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 will also be applicable
to major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources
do not significantly contribute to PM-10 levels that exceed the PM-10 ambient standards in the area.


Response to Comments


The EPA received one comment letter from Chevron U.S.A. Products Company on its October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52467-52474),
FR proposal to approve the El Paso moderate nonattainment area PM-10 SIP, including the proposal to approve
the El Paso PM-10 SIP as meeting the requirements of section 179B of the CAA regarding implementation plans and
revisions for international border areas. The letter expressed overall agreement with the EPA's proposal to approve
the El Paso PM-10 nonattainment SIP, but also posed one question regarding the three year progress report discussed
in the section entitled ``Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress'' (58 FR 52472). Chevron expressed overall
support for the three year PM-10 progress report requirement, beginning November 15, 1994, but questioned
whether the EPA should require as a part of the report an evaluation of any additional controls which may be feasible
to reduce exposures and/or bring the area into attainment. Chevron stated that since the EPA has found that the El Paso
area would not need any additional PM-10 control measures but for transborder PM-10, they did not see how
any additional controls could be justified as feasible for El Paso under the CAA.
The EPA, in this final rulemaking action, is approving the El Paso PM-10 SIP because it shows timely attainment
of the PM-10 NAAQS based on United States (El Paso County) emissions alone. Nevertheless, because the PM-10
NAAQS reflects public health and welfare standards, and because PM-10 NAAQS exceedances are still being monitored
in the El Paso nonattainment area, the EPA is encouraging the State of Texas to evaluate the feasibility of further
reductions in El Paso County PM-10 emissions beyond the amounts accounted for by the control measures put in
place by the PM-10 SIP being approved in this action. Additional reductions would further reduce the PM-10
concentrations to which the 
El Paso County population is exposed to by virtue of the additional contribution from international transport. Any
additional control measures found to be feasible by the State of Texas would be subject to full public notice and public
comment. The State of Texas has committed, provided that adequate information becomes available, to develop a contingency
plan for PM-10 in the El Paso area. The State also anticipates the continuation of a cooperative effort to study
PM-10 air quality in the El Paso/Juarez air basin.


Final Action


Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
In this final action, the EPA is granting approval of the El Paso, Texas, moderate nonattainment area PM-10 SIP
because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.
This SIP revision was submitted to the EPA by cover letter from the Governor of Texas dated November 5, 1991. On
October 8, 1993, the EPA announced its proposed approval of the moderate nonattainment area PM-10 SIP for El
Paso (58 FR 52467-52474). In that rulemaking action, the EPA described in detail its interpretations of title
I and its rationale for proposing to approve the El Paso PM-10 SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual
issues presented.
The EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 58 FR 52474), and one comment letter
was received during the comment period, which ended on
November 8, 1993. This final action on the El Paso PM-10 SIP is unchanged from the October 8, 1993, proposed approval
action. The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action that the EPA is now finalizing.
The public is referred to the October 8, 1993, proposed approval FR action for a full discussion of the action that the
EPA is now finalizing.
The EPA finds that the State of Texas' PM-10 SIP for the 
El Paso nonattainment area meets the RACM/RACT requirement. The State of Texas included a listing of RACT, federally
enforceable in approved permits, being used at all major and other stationary sources in the El Paso area. In addition,
the EPA views the State's prescribed burning, fugitive dust, and residential wood combustion control measures in
Regulation I and the El Paso City Ordinance 9.38, as contingency measures that go beyond the core RACM control strategy.
The EPA is also approving the memorandum of understanding between the City of El Paso and the Texas Air Control Board
(TACB) (now the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission), which serves to define the division of responsibility
for, and the commitments to carry out, the provisions of Regulation I and Chapter 9.38 of the City Code (City of El Paso
episodic curtailment program regarding wood combustion).
The State of Texas referenced section 179B of the CAA when presenting their modeling demonstration for El Paso. The
demonstration showed that the El Paso PM-10 moderate nonattainment area would be in attainment of the PM-10
NAAQS both currently and by December 31, 1994, based on dispersion modeling of United States (El Paso County) PM-10
emissions alone. After review, the EPA found the demonstration to be satisfactory. Details of the EPA's evaluation
were discussed in the
October 8, 1993, proposed approval action and in the EPA's Technical Support Document. Accordingly, the EPA is approving
the demonstration as showing that the SIP provides for timely attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS but for emissions
emanating from Mexico.
The EPA is also granting the El Paso PM-10 nonattainment area the exclusion from PM-10 precursor control
requirements authorized under section 189(e) of the CAA. Finally, to satisfy section 189(c) of the CAA (regarding
quantitative milestones and RFP), the State of Texas will report to the EPA every three years, beginning on November
15, 1994, the following information regarding the El Paso nonattainment area: (1) The status and effectiveness of
the existing controls, including quantification of emission reductions achieved relative to those projected in
the El Paso PM-10 SIP submittal; (2) significant changes in the inventory due to new source growth or other activities
(to allow for a comparison with the 1990 base year PM-10 emission inventory, and the projected 1994 PM-10
emission inventory); and (3) an evaluation of any additional controls which may be feasible to reduce exposures and/or
bring the area into attainment.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action makes final the action proposed at 58 FR 52467 (October 8, 1993). As noted elsewhere in this action, the
EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has
reclassified this action from table one to table three under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214,
January 19, 1989, and revised via memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the Regional
Administrators dated
October 4, 1993.


Miscellaneous


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

U.S. E.P.A.

, 
427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)).
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).


Executive Order 


This action has been classified as a table three action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived tables
two and three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two
years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for table two and three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed
to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

modeling techniques (e.g., Urban Airshed Model), future studies will attempt to better define the relative contributions
of 
El Paso and Juarez to the PM-10 problem in the basin. At that time, a contingency plan can more appropriately be
developed in a cooperative effort with Mexico.''

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; 
California State Implementation Plan Revision; 
San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on September 2, 1992. The revisions concern rules from the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District
(SJVUAPCD) which is comprised of the following eight air pollution control districts (APCDs): Fresno County APCD,
Kern County APCD, Kings County APCD, Madera County APCD, Merced County APCD, San Joaquin County APCD, Stanislaus
County APCD, and Tulare County APCD. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved
SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in
accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control
VOC emissions from vegetable oil processing and from can and coil coating operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the
approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On September 2, 1992 at 57 FR 40157, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SJVUAPCD Rule
461.2, Vegetable Oil Processing Operations, and SJVUAPCD Rule 460.4, Can and Coil Coating Operations. Rule 461.2
was adopted by SJVUAPCD on April 11, 1991; and Rule 460.4 was adopted by SJVUAPCD September 19, 1991. The rules were
submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 30, 1991 and January 28, 1992 respectively. The
rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment
areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that
interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above
rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the NPR cited above. 


EPA has evaluated the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPR cited above.
EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluations has been provided at 57 FR 40157 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX
office (TSDs for Rule 461.2 and 460.4 dated April 30, 1992 and March 12, 1992 respectively). 



Response to Comments 




A 30-day public comment period was provided at 57 FR 40157. EPA received no comments on rule 460.4. EPA received comments
on rule 461.2 from three sources: (1) The National Cottonseed Products Association (``NCPA''); (2) the J.G. Boswell
Company (``Boswell''); and (3) the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils, Inc (``Institute''). All three commented
on SJVUAPCD's definition of volatile organic compounds (``VOCs'')_suggesting that the definition not include
vegetable oil emissions. In addition, the NCPA and Institute also recommmended that SJVUAPCD rule 461.2 specify
performance standards or emissions limits rather than specific equipment for RACT controls. 


The comments are discussed below. 



1. 

Definition of VOC




Summary of comments:

 Rule 461.2 defines VOC as ``any compound containing at least one atom of carbon except for the following exempt compounds.''
Vegetable oil is not listed as an exempt compound. The comments stated that the rule should exempt vegetable oil from
the definition of VOC because of its low volatility and because the EPA has determined that vegetable oil should not
be considered a VOC under EPA test methods.

Responses:

 (1) Rule 461.2 does not specify RACT for controlling VOC emissions from vegetable oil; rather, the purpose of the rule
is to establish RACT for controlling the VOC emissions from the processing operations which extract vegetable oil.
Hexane extraction of vegetable oil is known to cause substantial emissions of VOCs, and these are the types of emissions
that are controlled by Rule 461.2, not emissions from vegetable oil. The EPA policy memorandum dated April 1991 (``The
Impact of Declaring Soybean Oil Exempt from VOC Regulations on the Coatings Program'') specifically addresses cooking
processes which use vegetable oil. Besides, Rule 461.2 would not be considered defective even if it adopted a more
stringent definition of VOC than EPA. 
(2) 

Specification of Control Equipment: 

The NCPA and Institute commented that Rule 461.2 was defective because the rule specifies control technology rather
than a performance standard_the NCPA and the Institute argue that this approach will reduce flexibility and discourage
innovation in identifying control equipment. 


Response: 

Rule 461.2 provides that emissions from the desolventizer-toaster or extractor be controlled either by use of a condenser
and mineral oil scrubber with a 90% control efficiency, or with ``[a]n emission control device, with a combined capture
and control efficiency of at least 90 percent by weight, confirmed by source testing.'' EPA interprets this provision
of the rule as establishing a performance standard rather than as establishing a specific control technology in that
alternatives to the condenser and the scrubber are allowed as long as capture and control efficiency performance
standards are met. 
Although the second requirement of Rule 461.2 (which states that emissions from the desolventizer-toaster conveyor,
cooler or tumbler, be controlled with a mineral oil scrubber that has a combined capture and control efficiency of
at least 90 percent by weight) does designate a specific control technology, EPA has not placed regulatory restrictions
on State and local agencies with respect to the range of acceptable measures and/or performance standards that must
be specified in a RACT rule. EPA believes that the State should decide the degree of flexibility to provide to regulated
industry in selecting acceptable control measures and/or performance standards. 


EPA Action 


EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal
under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D of the CAA. This approval action will
incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate
emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which
superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial 
review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994.
Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this
rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may
be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM

10

 Implementation Plan for Montana 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment
of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM

10

 SIP for Missoula. In this final rule, EPA also approves the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, except
several rules regarding emergency procedures, permitting, open burning, wood-waste burners, new source performance
standards, hazardous air pollutant standards, and variances. EPA will propose separate action on these rules when
the State fulfills its related commitments. One commitment has been fulfilled (see the This Action section of this
document for more information). If the State fails to fulfill the remainder of its commitments, EPA will take appropriate
action. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's odor provisions. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


The Missoula, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM

10

 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.

1

 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for
moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.





EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions
submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale.

Those States containing initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas (i.e., those areas designated nonattainment for PM

10

 under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November
15, 1991: 



1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM

10

 also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. 
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified
major stationary sources of PM

10

 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that
become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to
achieve RFP or to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543-13544.
On September 15, 1993, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Missoula, Montana moderate nonattainment area
PM

10

 SIP, including parts of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as meeting those moderate nonattainment
area PM

10

 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 (58 FR 48339-48343). In that proposed rulemaking action and related
Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing
to approve the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.
EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 58 FR 48343), and comments from the
State of Montana and Stone Container Corporation were received during the comment period, which ended on October
15, 1993. (For further discussion of these public comments, please see below and the Addendum to the TSD for EPA's proposed
rulemaking action on this SIP.) This final action on the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP, and portions of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, is unchanged from the September 15,
1993 proposed approval action, except for two typographical errors noted by EPA. First, in the table describing sources,
controls, emission reductions, and effective dates, the effective date for the Louisiana-Pacific permit modification
should have been listed as March 20, 1992 instead of January 23, 1992, as indicated. Second, under the Enforceability
Issues section, the final modification date for Stone Container Corporation's air quality permit #2589-M should
have been January 23, 1992 instead of November 25, 1992, as indicated.
The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the September 15, 1993 proposed rule for a more in-depth discussion of the action now being finalized.


II. Response to Comments


EPA did not receive any adverse public comments regarding its September 15, 1993 proposed approval of the Missoula
moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP (58 FR 48339-48343). However, the State of Montana submitted comments for clarification purposes, and
Stone Container Corporation submitted comments to express general support for EPA's action. Comments were as follows.
In a letter dated September 24, 1993 from Jeff Chaffee, Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences,
to Amy Platt, EPA, and through verbal communications, the State indicated that since submitting the original moderate
nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP for Missoula, it discovered a minor arithmetic error in its 24-hour attainment and maintenance demonstrations,
as well as an error in the way it had addressed background concentrations in both the 24-hour and annual attainment
and maintenance demonstrations. The background concentrations, i.e., naturally occurring PM

10

 concentrations that cannot be controlled, had not been subtracted from the 24-hour and annual design values before
apportioning the credits derived from the outlined control measures. The State has corrected these calculations,
and with the adjustments, the 24-hour and annual attainment values (i.e., ambient PM

10

 air quality levels achieved by 1995

2

) are as follows: 143.8  u g/m

3

 and 44.7  u g/m

3

, respectively. (Before these adjustments, the 24-hour and annual attainment values were 142.1  u g/m

3

 and 45.3  u g/m

3

, respectively.) The adjusted 24-hour and annual maintenance values (i.e., ambient PM

10

 air quality levels maintained through January 1, 1998) are 147.0  u g/m

3

 and 45.5  u g/m

3

, respectively. (Before these adjustments, the 24-hour and annual maintenance values were 145.2  u g/m

3

 and 46.2  u g/m

3

, respectively.)





Since these corrected calculations are based on properly handling the background concentration and since the adjusted
values still adequately demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM

10

 NAAQS and do not represent major changes to those considered in EPA's proposed action, EPA is proceeding with its approval
of this SIP. There is no need to adopt additional control measures based on these adjusted calculations.
Comments were also received in an October 11, 1993 letter from Larry Weeks, Stone Container Corporation, to Amy Platt,
EPA. The comments were not adverse and expressed general support for EPA's action on the Missoula PM

10

 SIP. However, several of Stone Container's comments indicate a misunderstanding of EPA's intended action on this
SIP and need further explanation.
First, EPA did not propose to approve the odor control rules contained in the SIP submittal and Stone Container communicated
its support but referenced ``Montana's odor control rules.'' EPA's action regarding odor regulations applies specifically
to the Missoula City-County regulation (Chapter IX, Subchapter 14, Rule 1427) contained in the SIP submittal. 
Second, Stone Container submitted comments suggesting it viewed the reduction in allowable PM

10

 emissions from its No. 5 recovery boiler as voluntary reductions. Stone Container's recovery boilers were identified
by chemical mass balance receptor modelling to contribute 8.1% of the PM

10

 ambient concentrations in Missoula. The SIP submittal demonstrated that Stone Container is contributing to the
PM

10

 nonattainment problem in the Missoula and vicinity nonattainment area and that reductions in allowable emissions
from recovery boiler No. 5 are part of an enforceable permit that are necessary to demonstrate expeditious attainment
of the PM

10

 NAAQS in the area. EPA agrees with the State's judgement that the reduction in allowable emissions from recovery boiler
No. 5 is necessary to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS in the area. EPA's final approval of this limitation means that it will become part of the federally enforceable
implementation plan. See, e.g., sections 113 and 302(q) of the Act. 
Next, Stone Container commented that because EPA proposed to approve the control requirement exclusion for major
stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors authorized by section 189(e) of the Act, it would not make sense for the SIP to include contingency measures
that would call for limitations on industrial sources. Contingency measures for moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are due to EPA no later than November 15, 1993 and were not submitted by the State as part of the SIP
revisions being addressed in this action. Thus, this comment is misplaced and does not address a matter within the
scope of the September 15, 1993 proposed action on the SIP submittals for the Missoula area. For clarification purposes,
EPA simply notes that EPA's finding that major sources of PM

10

 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Missoula addresses PM

10

 precursors only. Note that this finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing
mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors
in the area. Stone Container has been shown to be currently contributing to primary PM

10

 emissions in Missoula.
Finally, since Stone Container has been shown to contribute to the PM

10

 ambient concentrations in Missoula, contingency measures that include limitations on its emissions could be sought
by the State. Although Stone Container is located outside the nonattainment area, it is still a contributing source
(approximately 8% of the PM

10

 ambient concentrations in Missoula). Therefore, it may be necessary and reasonable to include emission reductions
at Stone Container as part of the contingency measures for Missoula. EPA will reserve judgement on the adequacy of
any contingency measures submitted by the State until such time as EPA receives a contingency measure submittal and
provides public notice and opportunity for public comment on its adequacy. 


This Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
The Governor of Montana submitted the Missoula PM

10

 SIP with a letter dated June 4, 1992, and requested that EPA take action on the June 4, 1992 submittal together with the
August 20, 1991 submittal of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. The submittals taken together
were intended to satisfy those moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP requirements due for Missoula on November 15, 1991. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (58 FR 48339-48343,
September 15, 1993), the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 plan includes, among other things, a comprehensive and accurate emissions inventory, control measures that satisfy
the RACM requirement, a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS will be achieved by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2), provisions for meeting the November 15, 1994 quantitative
milestone and reasonable further progress, and enforceability documentation. Further, EPA proposed to determine
that major sources of precursors of PM

10

 do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Missoula.

 Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 48339) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion
of these elements of the Missoula plan.





In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its approval of those elements of the Missoula, Montana moderate nonattainment
area PM

10

 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted on August 20, 1991 and June 4, 1992. In this final action, EPA is
also announcing its approval of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations (which were
submitted on August 20, 1991 and June 4, 1992) except for the following provisions: Chapter IX-Subchapter 4,
Emergency Procedures; Subchapter 11, Permit, Construction & Operation of Air Contaminant Sources; Subchapter
13, Open Burning; Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners, Rule 1423, Standard of Performance for New Stationary
Sources (NSPS), Rule 1424, Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), and Rule 1427, Control of
Odors in Ambient Air; and Chapter X, Variances. EPA described the deficiencies associated with these rules in its
notice of proposed rulemaking and the TSD for that action.
EPA finds that the State of Montana's PM

10

 SIP for the Missoula moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Five sources/source categories were identified
as contributing to the PM

10

 nonattainment problem in Missoula and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated
that by applying control measures to area sources (re-entrained road dust, residential wood combustion, prescribed
burning, and motor vehicle exhaust), as well as reducing allowable emissions through air quality permit modifications
for Louisiana-Pacific and Stone Container, Missoula will be in attainment by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2). It
does not appear that applying further control measures to these sources would expedite attainment. EPA views the
following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM

10

 emissions reductions in Missoula: (a) Missoula County Rule 1401(7), which sets sanding and chip sealing standards
and street sweeping and flushing requirements; (b) Missoula County Rule 1401(9), which establishes liquid de-icer
requirements; (c) industry permit modifications made to reduce allowable PM

10

 emissions from Stone Container Corporation's recovery boiler No. 5 and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's particle
board dryers; and (d) the Federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover. Further,
although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA is approving the following measures to make them federally enforceable
and to further strengthen the SIP. The measures provide additional PM

10

 air quality protection. These measures are: (a) Missoula County Rule 1428, which sets standards for the regulation
for solid fuel burning devices; and (b) Missoula County Rule 1310(3), which sets standards for the regulation of prescribed
wildland open burning. 
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including
available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented,
can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Missoula moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP (58 FR 48339-48343). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that
it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM

10

 nonattainment plan for Missoula will result in the attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2). By this notice EPA is approving the Missoula PM

10

 moderate nonattainment area plan's control measures as satisfying the RACM, including RACT, requirement.
As noted, EPA did not propose approval, nor is EPA taking final action, on some portions of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program regulations. To address EPA-identified deficiencies in the Missoula and statewide
SIP, the State committed to complete additional tasks to correct these deficiencies (except the concerns EPA raised
regarding the variance provisions). A more detailed explanation of the State's commitments can be found in EPA's
September 15, 1993 proposed approval of the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP (58 FR 48339-48343) and the TSD for that action). Since none of the rules associated with these commitments
has an impact on the attainment demonstration, credited control strategies in the Missoula PM

10

 SIP, or other Federal Clean Air Act SIP requirements for the Missoula moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area due to EPA on November 15, 1991, EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, when such commitments
are fulfilled by the State, and also will address the variances chapter at that time. Further, EPA is declining to take
action on Chapter IX, Subchapter 14: Rule 1427, Control of Odors in Ambient Air. These odor provisions do not have a
reasonable connection to the NAAQS-related air quality goals of the Clean Air Act.
The State has fulfilled one commitment to revise its NSPS and NESHAPs regulations to incorporate all Federal requirements
promulgated through July 1, 1992. In a March 9, 1993 submittal, the State satisfied this commitment, and EPA will announce
its action on these revisions in a separate notice.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.


Final Action


This document announces EPA's final action on the action proposed at 58 FR 48339. As noted elsewhere in this final action,
EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has
reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January
19, 1989. 


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be file, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)


Executive Order (EO) 12866


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and
3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which
superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

ACTION:

 Correcting amendments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document serves to correct the duplicate numbering of paragraphs found in the Identification of Plan Section
of the Maryland State Implementation Plan (SIP). This technical correction is necessary so as to assign an individual
paragraph number for a SIP revision approved by EPA on May 16, 1990. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 16, 1990 (55 FR 20269), EPA approved a revision submitted by Maryland consisting of a bubble for the American
Cyanamid plant in Havre de Grace. EPA's approval action was incorporated by reference (IBR'd) into the Identification
of Plan section (40 CFR 52.1070) of the federally-approved Maryland SIP, and was assigned paragraph  52.1070(c)(87).




Subsequently, it was discovered that 40 CFR 52.1070(c)(87) had already been assigned to a prior EPA approval action
of a revision to the Maryland SIP. Accordingly, an editorial note was published in paragraph  52.1070(c)(87),
explaining that EPA will correctly redesignate in a future notice the (c)(87) paragraph describing EPA's approval
of the American Cyanamid bubble. By this action, EPA redesignates the IBR paragraph associated with the May 16, 1990
approval action as  52.1070(c)(91).

Educational Opportunity Centers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Educational Opportunity Centers program. The Educational Opportunity
Centers program is authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), and these final regulations
implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. In addition to incorporating statutory
changes, the regulations also clarify and simplify requirements governing the program and revise one funding criterion.




The purposes and allowable activities of the Educational Opportunity Centers program support the National Education
Goals. Specifically, the program funds projects designed to improve the academic competency of program participants
(Goal 

#

3). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These regulations implement the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325, enacted July 23, 1992).
The Educational Opportunity Centers program provides grants to institutions of higher education; public and private
agencies and organizations; combinations of institutions, agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools
under special circumstances. The purposes of the program are to (1) provide information regarding financial and
academic assistance available for individuals who desire to pursue a program of postsecondary education; and (2)
assist individuals in applying for admission to institutions that offer programs of postsecondary education, including
preparing necessary applications for use by admissions and financial aid officers. 



On October 26, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57704). The NPRM included a summary of regulations proposed to implement statutory changes and other regulations
proposed to clarify and simplify requirements governing the program.



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 45 persons submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and the changes that have been made in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is published
as an appendix to these final regulations. 



Major Changes in the Regulations 



The major differences between the NPRM and these final regulations are as follows: 



1. Section 644.21 (Selection Criteria_Plan of Operation)



The criterion listed under  644.21(c)(5) has been modified to encourage applicants to include information
about their plan to coordinate with other projects for disadvantaged students. 



2. Section 644.30 (Allowable Costs) 



Section 644.30 has been revised to include, as allowable costs, transportation, lodging, and meals for project participants
and staff during visits to postsecondary institutions or for participation in ``College Day'' and career awareness
activities. Also, fees for college admissions applications and college entrance examination fees are now permissible
under certain circumstances. 



3. Section 644.31 (Unallowable Costs) 



This section has been revised to conform to the changes made in the allowable costs section.

4. Section 644.32 (Recordkeeping) 



The language in  644.32(d)(1) has been modified to lessen the recordkeeping burden on grantees. 



Intergovernmental Review 



This program is subject to the requirement of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.


In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States. 

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered or is available from any other agency
or authority of the United States.

Appendix_Analysis of Comments and Responses 



The following is an analysis of the comments and changes in the regulations since the publication of the NPRM on October
26, 1993 (58 FR 57704). Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.
Minor changes_and suggested changes that the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable statutes_are
not generally addressed. 






How long is a project period? ( 644.6) 

Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the Secretary change the regulations so that a competition for Educational Opportunity
Center (EOC) grants would be held once every two years. The commenter noted that such a schedule would be more efficient
than a 4-year schedule and would be more fair because applicants who were not funded could reapply more quickly. 



Discussion:

 The length of EOC project periods is prescribed in the Higher Education Act. Section 644.6 of these regulations merely
reflects the statutory requirement. 



Changes:

 None. 



What selection criteria does the Secretary use? ( 644.21) 

Comment:

 Several commenters recommended that  644.21(c)(5) be changed to require the Secretary to consider an applicant's
plan to coordinate its EOC project with other projects that serve disadvantaged students. The commenters maintained
that allotting points based on such a plan would encourage coordination among projects. Some commenters offered
specific langauge suggesting that the Secretary evaluate an applicant's plan of operation based in part on ``the
plan, including the project's organization structure, its coordination with other programs for disadvantaged
students sponsored by the sponsoring entity, and the time committed to the project by administrative and other staff,
to ensure the proper and efficient administration of the project.'' 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that an applicant's plan to coordinate activities with other projects should be considered
in the selection criteria and that such consideration will encourage coordination. However, the Secretary recognizes
that in some cases an EOC project may be the only project for disadvantaged students administered by a particular institution
or agency. Therefore, the Secretary has adopted much of the suggested language but has included the modifier ``where
appropriate'' to ensure that applicants who administer only an EOC project will not be disadvantaged by their inability
to coordinate with other projects. 



Changes:

 Section 644.21(c)(5) has been changed to read: ``The management plan to ensure the proper and efficient administration
of the project including, but not limited to, the project's organizational structure, the time committed to the project
by the project director and other personnel, and, where appropriate, its coordination with other projects for disadvantaged
students.'' 



How does the Secretary evaluate prior experience? ( 644.22)

<TEXT>
 



Comment: 

Many commenters suggested that the Secretary change  644.22, relating to prior experience points. None of
the commenters asked the Secretary to change the wording of the criteria; all requested that the Secretary describe
in greater detail how the criteria are applied. Some commenters argued the regulations should require the Secretary
to notify grantees as to the number of points they received for prior experience before the funding determinations
are made. Commenters argued that such a procedure would allow grantees to ``correct errors'' in the Secretary's evaluation
of their prior experience. Other commenters suggested that the regulations should require the Secretary to award
a portion of the prior experience points each year based on a grantee's annual performance report. They suggested
that each grantee should be informed within a specified period as to how well each performance report was scored. 

Commenters also noted that the regulations should require the Secretary to award prior experience points based only
on a grantee's performance during the first two years of its grant. This procedure, they argued, would ensure that
a grantee's prior experience would be measured against actual outcomes rather than speculation about what the grantee
is likely to have accomplished by the end of the project period. Several commenters offered suggestions on how prior
experience points should be allocated under the two-year evaluation schedule. 



Discussion: 

The comments suggest a high degree of anxiety over how the Secretary rates prior experience. The comments imply that
the assessment process should be continuous, extensive, and interactive. The Secretary, however, has no intention
of unnecessarily burdening grantees with such a process. 
Under  644.20(2)(i) of the regulations, the Secretary only evaluates prior experience when a grantee submits
an application for ``a new grant to continue to serve substantially the same populations or campuses that the applicant
is serving under an expiring grant.'' Prior experience is not evaluated until the Secretary receives such an application.
This procedure reflects the mandate expressed in section 402(A)(c)(1) of the Higher Education Act, which states:
``In making grants * * * the Secretary shall consider prior experience.'' The law requires the Secretary
to evaluate prior experience only when the Secretary is deciding to make a grant; the Secretary only decides to make
a grant if an application has been submitted. Thus, the final assessment of prior experience is conducted as part of
the overall process for selecting new grants. This process begins when applications are received and ends when applicants
are notified of the Secretary's funding decisions. 

The application process is not an interactive process. After the closing date, no additional information is accepted
or considered. Therefore, any information that an applicant feels should be considered during the course of the selection
process should be provided before the closing date. The Secretary does not disclose information relating to the rank
of applications until all applicants are notified of the Secretary's funding decisions. After applicants receive
notification, they may request copies of documents that reflect the prior experience assessments. 



Changes: 

None. 



What are allowable costs? ( 644.30) 
Comment:

 Many commenters suggested that the Secretary amend  644.30 of the proposed regulations to include college
admission fees and college entrance examination fees in the list of allowable costs. The commenters noted that many
adult EOC participants cannot afford to pay examination and application fees and are therefore discouraged from
pursuing postsecondary education. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that admission fees should be included in the list of allowable costs because some adult participants
may be discouraged from applying to postsecondary institutions because of the expense associated with examination
and application fees. However, the Secretary strongly encourages Educational Opportunity Centers to work with
higher educational institutions to secure waivers whenever possible. Further, application fees will not be an allowable
cost under  644.30 if the fee is paid to the grantee institution because the Secretary encourages grantees to
provide meaningful support to the Educational Opportunity Centers that they administer.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940118-0-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940118-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Changes:

 The Secretary has changed  644.30 so that the list of allowable costs includes fees required for college admissions
applications or entrance examination fees if (1) a waiver of the fee is unavailable; and (2) the fee is paid by the grantee
to a third party on behalf of a participant. 



What are unallowable costs? ( 644.31) 

Comment:

 Many commenters requested that the Secretary remove transportation, meals, and lodging from the list of unallowable
costs in  644.31. The commenters further requested that the Secretary include transportation, meals, and
lodging in the list of allowable costs in  644.30. Several commenters argued that campus visits are necessary
to help participants choose an appropriate postsecondary placement. Other commenters noted that such visits are
often impossible for EOC participants who reside in rural areas. Finally, some commenters argued that transportation,
meals, and lodging should be allowable costs because they are allowable under the Talent Search program. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that college visits are often necessary to help adult participants gain the confidence and
insight that they need to feel comfortable in applying for college admission. The Secretary agrees with the commenters
that it would be unfortunate if the cost of such visitations prevented some participants from pursuing postsecondary
education. Therefore, on a case-by-case basis, transportation, lodging, and meals may be allowable costs under
the circumstances described in the regulations. 



Changes:

 The Secretary has removed transportation, lodging, and meals from the list of unallowable costs in  644.31.
The Secretary has also changed  644.30 so that the list of allowable costs includes: ``(a) Transportation,
meals, and, with specific prior approval of the Secretary, lodging for participants and staff for_(1) Visits to postsecondary
educational institutions to obtain information relating to the admission of participants to those institutions;
(2) Participation in ``College Day'' activities; and (3) Field trips to observe and meet with people who are employed
in various career fields in the target area and who can act as role models for participants.'' 



What other requirements must a grantee meet? ( 644.32) 

Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that the Secretary should change  644.32(d)(1) to read: ``Unless a part-time director
furthers coordination of the project with other programs for disadvantaged clients operated by the sponsoring institution
or agency, or unless a waiver is granted, a grantee shall employ a full-time project director.'' The commenters argued
that the change was necessary because the language in the NPRM does not reflect the intent of the 1992 Amendments to
the Higher Education Act, which requires the Secretary to encourage coordination among TRIO programs and other programs
for disadvantaged students and to allow for a less-than-full-time director. 

One commenter recommended that the Secretary require a full-time project director at all Educational Opportunity
Centers. The commenter noted that the degree of detail to which a director must be attentive requires a full-time commitment.
The commenter further suggested that coordination among projects is desirable and can be accomplished when various
directors work together for the mutual benefit of all projects on a single campus. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary strongly supports coordination of EOC activities between and among projects to extent that the coordination
fosters_

(1) Improved services for the EOC participants; 
(2) More efficient or effective means of delivering services; or 
(3) An increase in the resources available to participants. 

There is no magic formula for coordination. It only occurs when all partners see it in their best interest to cooperate
and coordinate activities to obtain some beneficial objectives. Projects do not have to share staff to coordinate
activities. Coordination can occur in a number of ways by staff at all levels. Having a part-time director does not
guarantee that coordination of activities will occur. Having a full-time director does not guarantee that the coordination
of activities will not occur. 

Each project is different in terms of its setting, resources, and support systems. The Secretary recognizes that
a project may effectively operate with less than a full-time director if other support personnel are in place to assist
in shared management duties. However, coordination can take many other forms. For example, coordination may be achieved
by planning and conducting joint or cooperative field trips, lectures, career days, or test-preparation sessions.
Coordination may also be achieved by sharing space or equipment.

<PARENT> FR940118-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 644.32(d)(1) accurately reflects both the intent of the 1992 Amendments to the HEA and the Secretary's commitment
to coordination. Waivers of the requirement for a full-time director are available under  644.32(d)(3) if
an applicant can show that efforts to coordinate among projects will be hindered by not allowing one person to direct
more than one project. 

The Secretary believes that in many cases the size and scope of an EOC project require the attention of a full-time director.
The average EOC project receives more than a million dollars over the course of a project period and serves more than
eight thousand participants. Given the size and scope of EOC projects, the Secretary believes that the appropriateness
of allowing a part-time director must be evaluated with great care. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should change  644.32(c)(3), relating to records of educational
benefits. The commenters requested that the Secretary eliminate the phrase ``the specific educational benefits
to the participants that resulted from the services'' because keeping a record of how each participant benefited
from the services would be too burdensome. The commenters suggested that  644.32(c)(3) require only that grantees
keep a record of ``the specific educational benefits 

received 

by the participant.'' 

One commenter suggested that the Secretary should not change the recordkeeping requirement in  644.32(c)(3)
because it formed the basis for collecting valuable statistics.




Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the phrase ``that resulted from the services'' implies that a grantee must demonstrate
and record a causal relationship between services and benefits. The Secretary believes that such a record is not necessary
to indicate a benefit, particularly in instances where the services provided can be deemed to be benefits in and of
themselves.



Changes:

 The recordkeeping requirement at  644.32(c)(3) is changed to read ``the specific educational benefits received
by the participant.''

ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is extending coverage under Inmate Accident Compensation to inmates participating
in approved work assignments for other Federal agencies. Because inmates participating in such assignments may
be housed in a community corrections center, it is necessary to add procedures appropriate for the treatment and reporting
of injuries and for processing claims which may arise from such assignments. This amendment also clarifies the applicability
of lost-time wages, clarifies the effects of subsequent incarceration, clarifies the definition of ``release'',
clarifies payment procedures for medical treatment, and corrects a typographical error in the citation of a court
case. This amendment is intended to allow for the continued efficient operation of inmate work assignments. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Prisons published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39096) a proposed rule on Inmate Accident Compensation clarifying its applicability to approved
inmate work assignments for other federal agencies. The proposed amendment also clarified that lost-time wages
shall be available only for inmates based at Bureau of Prisons institutions (see new  301.201) and that the amount
of a payment for medical treatment is limited to reasonable expenses incurred, such as those amounts authorized under
the applicable fee schedule established for the Department of Health and Human Services Medicare program (see  301.317).
This amendment also revised the definition of ``release'' in  301.102 to include reference to pretrial inmates.
The proposed amendment also clarified  301.316 by rewording its provisions regarding subsequent incarceration
of a compensation recipient. There is no change in the intent of this section. Finally, the proposed amendment corrected
a typographical error in the citation of the court case 

U.S.

 v. 

Demko

 which appears in  301.319. 



The Bureau of Prisons received no comment to its proposed rule, and the amendment is accordingly being issued as a final
rule.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities: Amendments
to the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (Accessible Automated Teller Machines and Transportation
Facilities)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Justice.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends Appendix A to the Department of Justice regulation implementing title III of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) by incorporating the accessibility guidelines for transportation facilities issued
by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board), and by adopting the amendments
to the reach range requirement for accessible automated teller machines (ATMs) and fare vending machines jointly
issued by the Access Board and the Department of Transportation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On July 26, 1991 (56 FR 35544), the Department of Justice (Department) published its final regulation implementing
title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) Public Law 101-336, which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of disability by private entities that own, lease, lease to, or operate a place of public accommodation,
and requires that all new places of public accommodation and commercial facilities, and all alterations to such facilities,
be designed and constructed so as to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.

Section 36.406 of the regulation, ``Standards for new construction and alterations,'' provides that new construction
and alterations subject to the regulation shall comply with the standards for accessible design published as appendix
A to the regulation. Appendix A contains the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings
and Facilities (ADAAG), which was separately published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board (Access Board) as a final guideline on July 26, 1991 (56 FR 35408). On April 5, 1993, the Department issued a final
rule containing technical amendments to appendix A (58 FR 17521), which incorporated technical corrections to ADAAG
made by the Access Board on January 14, 1992 (57 FR 1393).


Section 36.406 of the title III regulation implements sections 306(b) and 306(c) of the ADA, which require the Attorney
General to promulgate standards for accessible design for buildings and facilities subject to the ADA, and require
those standards to be consistent with the supplemental minimum guidelines and requirements for accessible design
published by the Access Board pursuant to section 504 of the ADA. Sections 5 through 9 of appendix A are special application
sections and contain additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business
and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. Section 10 of ADAAG, which was intended to establish
special access requirements for transportation facilities, was reserved when the Department's final rule was published
because the Access Board had not yet published that section of its minimum guidelines.


On September 6, 1991 (56 FR 45500), the Access Board published a final rule amending the guidelines by adding final
guidelines for transportation facilities as a new section 10, and on January 14, 1992 (57 FR 1393), the Access Board
published a final rule making corrections to that section.


On September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006), the Access Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to
amend the reach range requirements for accessible ATMs under ADAAG based on new information received in connection
with a petition for rulemaking. The Access Board's proposed amendment set out the reach ranges for controls when a
person using a wheelchair could make a forward approach only, a parallel approach only, or both a forward and parallel
approach to an ATM. To address the reach over an obstruction resulting from recessed controls and the installation
of fixtures called ``surrounds'' (which contain writing counters and bins for envelopes and waste paper), in front
of ATMs, the proposed amendment included a table of reach depths and maximum heights for the placement of the controls
where the reach depth to any control is more than 10 inches from a parallel approach. A detailed discussion of the proposed
amendment is contained in the Access Board's proposed rule. On November 17, 1992 (57 FR 54210), the Department of Transportation
issued an NPRM to amend its ADA regulations in several respects, including conforming the standards for transportation
facilities to incorporate the reach range requirements for ATMs. The amendment is relevant to transportation facilities
because fare vending machines are required to comply with the same requirements as ATMs. See ADAAG 10.3.1(7). On July
15, 1993 (58 FR 38204), the Access Board and the Department of Transportation published a joint final rule adopting
the proposed changes to the reach range requirements for ATMs and fare vending machines.



On April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17558), this Department published a proposed rule to amend appendix A to its title III regulation
to include section 10 of the Access Board's final guidelines, as amended (transportation facilities), and to adopt
the changes relating to the reach range requirements applicable to automated teller machines proposed by the Access
Board in its September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006) proposed rule. In the Department's proposed rule, it sated that ``[a]ll
timely comments received by the Board on the proposed transportation rule issued by the Board on March 20, 1991 (56
FR 11874), and on the proposed rule relating to ATM reach ranges issued by the Board on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006),
will be deemed by the Department to have been submitted in response to this proposed rule and will be thoroughly analyzed
and considered by the Department prior to the adoption of any final rule. Therefore, it is not necessary for any timely
comments submitted to the Board on those proposed rules to be resubmitted to the Department.'' Any new comments on
the Department's proposed rule were due on or before May 5, 1993.





Summary of Rule and Comments





The Department of Justice is adopting as a final rule the accessibility guidelines for transportation facilities
published by the Access Board as a final rule on September 6, 1991, as amended by the Access Board on January 14, 1992,
and as further jointly amended on July 15, 1993, by the Access Board and the Department of Transportation, to reflect
changes relating to reach range requirements.

The Department is also adopting as a final rule the proposed amendment to the reach range requirement for ATMs. As stated
in the Department's NPRM, all timely comments received by the Access Board on the proposed transportation and ATM
rules have been analyzed by the Department in connection with this final rule. An analysis of these comments is contained
in the final rules issued by the Access Board and referenced above, and the Department concurs with the Access Board's
analysis. In addition to the comments previously received by the Access Board, the Department directly received
seven comments in response to its NPRM. Of these seven comments, three substantially duplicated comments on the proposed
revisions to ATM requirements previously sent to the Access Board by the same commenters, and two addressed issues
not covered by the NPRM. Of the two new comments on issues raised by the NPRM, one expressed support for both the proposed
transportation and the proposed ATM provisions without discussing any rationable for such support, and on comment,
submitted by an advocacy group, opposed the changes to ATM reach range requirements on the ground that the changes
would not make ATMs readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, but did not include any additional
documentation. 



Regulatory Process Matters 



The Department has determined that this final rule is not a major rule under E.O. 12291. Accordingly, a regulatory
impact statement is not required. 

The Department has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities. Therefore, it is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

The Department also has determined that there are no Federalism impacts sufficient to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim regulation implements that portion of subchapter C, part I (Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities
and Rural Development Investment Areas) of title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66,
approved August 10, 1993) dealing with the designation of rural Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Published
elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

 is a companion regulation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development which implements their portion of title
XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This rule authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to
designate not more than three rural Empowerment Zones and not more than thirty rural Enterprise Communities based
upon the effectiveness of the strategic plan submitted by an applicant and nominated by a State or States and local
governments. 



The purpose of this program is to empower rural communities and their residents to create jobs and opportunities to
build for tomorrow as part of a Federal-State-local and private-sector partnership. Businesses will be encouraged
to invest and create jobs in distressed areas, and comprehensive local strategic plans are to be adopted and implemented,
encouraging entrepreneurship, furthering local self-development and assisting in the revitalization of these
areas.

I. Background



The Empowerment Zones program confers upon rural distressed American communities the opportunity to take effective
action to create jobs and opportunities. The program combines tax benefits with substantial investment of Federal
resources and enhanced coordination among Federal agencies.

All communities which complete the nomination process will be strengthened by it; gaining by taking stock of their
assets and problems, by creating a vision of a better future, and by structuring a plan for achieving their vision.
Local partnerships among community residents, businesses, financial institutions, service providers, neighborhood
associations and State and local governments will be formed or strengthened by going through the application process.
Communities will be afforded an opportunity to work with these partners in the creation and implementation of a community-based
strategic plan.

Communities that are not designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities are eligible for certain benefits.
Under a separate program directed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Development Corporations
(CDCs) nominated by the locality, or the applicant for the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, will be considered
eligible for designation to receive tax preferred contributions from donors. HUD has committed to designating eight
rural CDCs for this program. Communities with innovative visions for change will be considered for requested waivers
of Federal program regulations, flexible use of existing program funds, and cooperation in meeting essential mandates,
even if they do not receive a designation by the Secretary as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

Communities that are designated as Enterprise Communities receive a number of benefits. Enterprise Communities
are eligible for new Tax-Exempt Facilities Bonds for certain private business activities. States with designated
Communities will receive Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grants (EZ/EC SSBG) in the
amount of approximately $3 million for each rural Enterprise Community to pass through to each designated area for
approved activities identified in the strategic plans. Enterprise Communities receive special consideration
in competition for funding under numerous Federal programs, including the new National Service and Community Policing
initiatives. The Federal Government will focus special attention on working cooperatively with designated Enterprise
Communities to overcome regulatory impediments, to permit flexible use of existing Federal funds, and to assist
these Communities in meeting essential mandates.

Communities that are designated as Empowerment Zones receive all of the benefits provided to Enterprise Communities,
in addition to other benefits. States with designated Empowerment Zones will receive Empowerment Zone/Enterprise
Community Social Service Block Grants in the amount of $40 million for each rural Empowerment Zone. Employer Wage
Credits for Empowerment Zone residents are provided to qualified employers engaged in trade, business, or human
service delivery in designated Empowerment Zones. Businesses are afforded an increased deduction under section
179 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified investments.

The rural part of the program will be administered by USDA as a Federal-State-local-private partnership, with a minimum
of red tape associated with the application process. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to design and implement
an effective strategic plan for real opportunities for growth and revitalization, that deal with local problems
is a comprehensive way, and must demonstrate the capacity or the commitment to carry out these plans. Development
of an effective plan must also involve the participation of the community affected by the nomination of the rural area,
and of the private sector, acting in concert with the State or States and local governments. The plan should be developed
in accordance with four key principles, which will also serve as the basis for the selection criteria that will be used
to evaluate the plan. These key principles reflect the Secretary's intention that Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
Community designations should be based on potential for successful economic and community revitalization as reflected
in the strategic planning process, participants in the plan, and the quality of the plan. Poverty, unemployment,
and other need factors are critical in determining eligibility for Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community status,
but play a less significant role in the selection process. The four key principles are:

(1) Economic opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, entrepreneurial
initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility;

(2) Sustainable community development, to advance the creation of liveable and vibrant communities through comprehensive
approaches that coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community and human development;

(3) Community-based partnerships, involving participation of all segments of the community, including the political
and governmental leadership, community groups, health and social service groups, environmental groups, religious
organizations, the private and non-profit sectors, centers of learning, other community institutions, and individual
citizens; and

(4) Strategic vision for change, which identifies what the community will become and a strategic map for revitalization.
The vision should build on assests and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should
also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting
the revitalization plan.

State and local governments and economic development corporations that are state chartered may nominate distressed
rural areas for designation as Empowerment Zones (which will also permit their consideration for designation as
Enterprise Communities), or solely for designation as Enterprise Communities.

Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 included Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities as a new
program.

III. Justification for Interim Rule



It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However,
exemptions are permitted where an agency finds, for good cause, that compliance would be impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to public interest. The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without
first soliciting public comment, in that prior public comment would be contrary to the public interest. The statute
requires that communities prepare a comprehensive strategic plan to submit their applications. For many communities,
such planning can take up to 5 months. Several additional months will be required to evaluate the applications and
make designations. Section 1391(c) of the legislation requires that designations be made only after 1993 and before
1996. Given the statutory mandate to make all designations within a two-year time period, the extra time required
to publish a proposed rule for a 60-day comment period before development of a final rule for effect would be contrary
to congressional intent and the purpose of the legislation. The longer time period would unduly postpone an economic
recovery for those communities and their residents for which this program is intended. Further, the Department finds
that good cause exists in that prior public comment is unnecessary because the legislation being implemented by this
rule is very prescriptive, with little room for discretion on the part of the Secretary.

The Department is interested, however, in the public reaction to the rule, and invites the public to comment. The Department
is limiting the comment period to 30 days to permit adequate time for review of public comments and development of a
final rule.



IV. Notice



USDA is simultaneously publishing in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 a Notice Inviting Applications that contains more specific guidance on submission deadlines and the process of submission
of applications.



V. Other Matters



National Environmental Policy Act



This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the
determination of USDA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review



This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Review as a significant rule, as that term is defined
in Executive Order 12866, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. The economic analysis required
by Executive Order 12866 will be retained in the public file with the Department's Rule Docket Clerk.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Secretary, in accordance with The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The Act is intended to encourage Federal agencies to utilize innovative administrative
procedures in dealing with individuals, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental bodies
that would otherwise be unnecessarily adversely affected by Federal regulations. To the extent that this rule affects
those entities, its purpose is to reduce any disproportionate burden by providing for the waiver of regulations and
by affording other incentives directed toward a positive economic impact. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility
analysis under the Act is necessary.



Executive Order 12611, Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. The purpose of this rule is to provide a cooperative atmosphere between the
Federal government and the States and local governments, and to reduce any regulatory burden imposed by the Federal
government that impedes the ability of State and local governments to solve pressing economic, social, and physical
problems in their communities.

I. Background 





The Empowerment Zones program is a key step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities
and rural heartland. It is designed to empower people and communities across the nation in developing and implementing
strategic plans to create job opportunities and sustainable community development. The program combines tax benefits
with substantial investment of Federal resources and enhanced coordination among Federal agencies. All communities
which complete the nomination process will be strengthened by it, whether or not they are selected as Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities, as the Federal Government will work with applicants to overcome programmatic regulations
and statutory impediments to encourage more effective economic, physical, environmental and community development
activities. 



All communities will gain by taking stock of their assets and problems, by creating a vision of a better future, and
by structuring a plan for achieving it. Local partnerships among community residents, businesses, financial institutions,
service providers, neighborhood associations and State and local governments can be formed or strengthened to support
a plan for change by going through the application process. Communities will be afforded an opportunity to work with
these new partners in the creation and implementation of a community-based strategic plan. Community Development
Corporations nominated by the locality will be considered eligible for designation to receive tax preferred contributions
from donors. Communities with innovative visions for change will be considered for requested waivers of Federal
program regulations, flexible use of existing program funds, and cooperation in meeting essential mandates, even
if they do not receive a designation. Communities may apply comprehensive strategic planning to their entire community
anticipating proposed consolidation of planning requirements for four major formula grant programs administered
by the Office of Community Planning and Development in HUD.



Enterprise Communities are eligible for new Tax-Exempt Facilities Bonds for certain private business activities.
States with designated Enterprise Communities will receive approximately $3 million in Empowerment Zone/Enterprise
Community Social Service Block Grant funds to pass through to each designated area for approved activities identified
in their strategic plans. Enterprise Communities will receive special consideration in competition for funding
under numerous Federal programs, including the new National Service and proposed Community Policing initiatives.
The Federal Government will focus special attention on working cooperatively with designated Enterprise Communities
to overcome regulatory impediments, to permit flexible use of existing Federal funds, and to assist these Communities
in meeting essential mandates. 



Empowerment Zones will receive all the benefits provided to Enterprise Communities and other communities with innovative
visions for change. Empowerment Zones are awarded substantial Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service
Block Grant funds, in the amount of $100 million for each urban Zone. An Employer Wage Credit for Zone residents is extended
to qualified employers engaged in trade or business, in designated Empowerment Zones. Businesses are afforded an
increased deduction under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified properties. 



The urban part of the program will be administered by HUD as a Federal-State-local partnership, with a minimum of red
tape associated with the application process. Communities must demonstrate the ability to design and implement
an effective strategic plan for real opportunities for growth and revitalization, that deal with local problems
in a comprehensive way and must demonstrate the capacity to carry out these plans. Development of an effective plan
must also involve the participation of the community affected by the nomination of the urban area, and of the private
sector, acting in concert with the nominating entities. The plan should be developed in accordance with four key principles,
which will serve as the basis for the key selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the plan. These principles
are: 



(1) Economic Opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, as well as entrepreneurial
initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility;



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940118-0-00067 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940118-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Sustainable Community Development, to advance the creation of liveable and vibrant communities through comprehensive
approaches that coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community and human development; 

(3) Community-Based Partnerships, involving participation of all segments of the community, including the political
and governmental leadership, community groups, health and social service groups, environmental groups, religious
organizations, the private and non-profit sectors, centers of learning and other community institutions; and 

(4) Strategic Vision for Change, which identifies what the community will become and a strategic map for revitalization.
The vision should build on assets and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should
also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting
the revitalization plan. 

State and local governments may nominate distressed urban areas for designation as Empowerment Zones (which will
also permit their consideration for designation as Enterprise Communities), or solely for designation as Enterprise
Communities.

Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
as a new program. 



II. Program Description

III. Justification for Interim Rule 



In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking at 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides for exceptions from that general rule
where the Department finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement
is satisfied when prior public comment is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest'' (24
CFR 10.1). The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public
comment, in that prior public comment would be contrary to the public interest. Section 1391(c) of the legislation
requires that designations be made only after 1993 and before 1996. Given the statutory mandate to make all designations
within a two-year period, the extra time required to publish a proposed rule for a 60-day comment period before development
of a final rule for effect would be contrary to congressional intent and the purpose of the legislation. The longer
time period would unduly postpone an economic recovery for those communities and their residents for which this program
is intended. Further, the Department finds that good cause exists in that prior public comment is unnecessary because
the legislation being implemented by this rule is very prescriptive, with little room for discretion on the part of
the Secretary. 

The Department is interested, however, in the public reaction to the rule, and invites the public to comment. Since
section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act provides that no rule promulgated by the Department
may become effective until 30 days after publication, and since section 1391(c) of the authorizing legislation requires
that designations be made within a two-year period, the Department is limiting the comment period to 30 days to permit
adequate time for review of public comments and development of a final rule. 

The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published
before that date. This ``sunset'' provision appears in  597.1(c) of the rule, and provides that the rule will
expire on a date 12 months from publication unless a final rule is published before that date. 



IV. Notice 



HUD is simultaneously publishing in today's 

Federal Register

 a Notice Inviting Applications that contains complete information on obtaining and submitting applications for
nominating areas as Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. 



V. Other Matters 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements contained in this rule were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), were approved,
and assigned OMB Control Number 2506-0148. The following provisions of the rule have been determined by the
Department to contain collection of information requirements:

National Environmental Policy Act 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
in 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332.
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours
in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10278, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review 



This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Review as a significant rule, as that term is defined
in Executive Order 12866, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes to the rule as a result
of that review are contained in the public file of the rule in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities within the intent and purpose of that Act. The Act is intended to encourage Federal agencies
to utilize innovative administrative procedures in dealing with individuals, small businesses, small organizations,
and small governmental bodies that would otherwise be unnecessarily adversely affected by Federal regulations.
To the extent that this rule affects those entities, its purpose is to reduce any disproportionate burden by providing
for the waiver of regulations and by affording other incentives directed toward a positive economic impact. Therefore,
no regulatory flexibility analysis under the Act is necessary. 



Executive Order 12611, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined
that, although the policies contained in this rule may have a substantial direct effect on States or their political
subdivisions that are designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities, this effect is intended by the
legislation authorizing the program. The purpose of the rule is to provide a cooperative atmosphere between the Federal
government and States and local governments, and to reduce any regulatory burden imposed by the Federal government
that impedes the ability of States and local governments to solve pressing economic, social, and physical problems
in their communities. 



Executive Order 12606, The Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the
provisions of this rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, except
to the extent that the program authorized by the rule will empower communities and their residents to take effective
action to solve difficult and pressing economic, human, community and physical development challenges that have
a negative impact on families. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order. 



Semiannual Agenda 



This rule was not listed in the Department's semiannual agenda of regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR
56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 49 FR 15960. A summary of the rule, however,
was listed on a supplemental agenda, submitted to the applicable House and Senate Committees after publication of
the October 25, 1993 agenda.

concerns will be addressed in a coordinated fashion; and explain how these linkages support the community's vision;

(12) Indicate how Social Services Block Grant funds for designated Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
will be utilized. 
(i) In doing so, the Strategic Plan shall provide the following information:
