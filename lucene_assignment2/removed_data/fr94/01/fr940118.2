<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the Market Promotion Program for Fiscal Year 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended, directs the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to ``carry
out a program to encourage the development, maintenance and expansion of commercial export markets for agricultural
commodities through cost-share assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign market development
program.'' Assistance under this program may be provided in the form of funds of, or commodities owned by, the CCC,
as determined appropriate by the Secretary.


MPP will be implemented in accordance with the regulations set forth in 7 CFR part 1485, subpart B, (56 FR 40745), August
16, 1991, as revised by the interim rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60549). The Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), who is Vice President
of CCC, is authorized to enter into agreements with nonprofit trade associations, regional associations of state
departments of agriculture, state groups, and U.S. private firms and cooperatives to provide cost-share assistance
to carry-out approved export promotion activities. Eligibility for promotional support will be limited to those
agricultural commodities or products which are at least 50 percent U.S. origin by weight, excluding added water.
Except for activities conducted by small-sized entities operating through state groups, promotional activities
will only be undertaken to counter or offset the adverse effects of a subsidy, import quota, or other unfair trade practice
of a foreign country, through cost-share assistance, in order to encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion
of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and products. Assistance may be provided for brand
promotion activities when such activities are determined by the Administrator, FAS, to be an effective means of carrying
out the purposes of the MPP.
To be considered by CCC, applicants must fully comply with the procedures specified in 7 CFR part 1485. Criteria for
the allocation of CCC resources in the MPP are set forth in 7 CFR 1485.15.
The applicant must provide the information required by 7 CFR part 1485 and may include any other factors the applicant
deems appropriate. All applications (original plus two copies) must be received by 5 p.m. eastern time, February
23, 1994 at the following address:


Overnight delivery:

[Docket No. 4-94]




Foreign-Trade Subzone 59A_Lincoln, NE; Request for Expanded Manufacturing Authority; 
Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corporation, U.S.A., Plant 
(Utility Work Trucks) 





An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing
Corporation, U.S.A. (KMM), operator of FTZ Subzone 59A, at the KMM manufacturing facilities, Lincoln, Nebraska,
requesting authority to manufacture utility work trucks under zone procedures. The application was submitted pursuant
to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the
Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on January 10, 1994. 



Subzone 59A was approved by the FTZ Board in 1980 with activity granted for the manufacture of motorcycles, jet skis,
and four wheel all terrain vehicles (Board Order 163, 45 FR 58637, 9-4-80). An application for expansion
of the subzone is currently pending (Doc. 56-93, 58 FR 63335, 12-1-93). 



KMM is now requesting subzone authority for the manufacture of certain off-road, gasoline engine utility work trucks
(called ``Mules'') (payload capacity up to 1,200 pounds) for the U.S. market and export. Foreign-sourced components
and subassemblies comprise approximately 40 percent of the finished vehicles' material value and include: engines,
transmissions, calipers, wheels, and tires (duty rate range: free-15.4%). All steel mill products will be
sourced domestically. 



Zone procedures would exempt KMM from Customs duty payments on the foreign components used in export production.
On its domestic 
sales, the company would be able to choose the duty rate that applies 
to the finished work trucks (HTSUS

#

 8709.19.0030, duty free) for the foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the savings from
zone procedures would help improve KMM's international competitiveness. 



In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the
application and report to the Board. 



Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is on March
21, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to April 4, 1994). 



A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:






U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, 
11133 ``O'' Street, 
Omaha, Nebraska 68137.

ACTION:

 Notice of termination of antidumping duty administrative reviews. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to requests from the respondent, Magyar Gordulocsapagy Muvek, the Department of Commerce initiated
administrative reviews of the respondent on July 22, 1992 for the period June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992, and on July
21, 1993 for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993. We are now terminating these reviews.

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background 





In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(c), the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review
of exports to the United States for the period June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 (57 FR 32521) on July 22, 1992, and for
the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993 (58 FR 39007) on July 21, 1993. On December 22, 1993, Magyar Gordulocsapagy
Muvek (MGM) and the Timken Company, the Petitioner, jointly asked the Department to terminate these reviews, stating
that both parties sought to conserve resources, and MGM withdrew its requests for reviews. 



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), ``the Secretary may permit a party that requests a review under paragraph
(a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than ninety days after the date of publication of notice of initiation
of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides that it is reasonable to
do so.'' 



Under the circumstances in which no interested party objects to the request for termination, we believe that it is
reasonable to extend the ninety-day time limit governing the withdrawal of requests for administrative reviews.
Thus, in view of MGM's and Timken's request of December 22, 1993, the Department is terminating these reviews. 



These terminations are in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On December 9, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 the final results of administrative reviews of the antidumping finding on tapered roller bearings, four inches or
less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan, and the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings
and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, from Japan. The reviews of the finding covered the periods from August
1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. The reviews of the order covered
the periods from October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1992.




Subsequent to the publication of the final results, the Department discovered that it had made a ministerial error
affecting the margins for Nachi-Fujikoshi. The Department also discovered ministerial errors affecting the margins
for NSK Ltd., Koyo Seiko, and NTN Corporation; however, since appeals have already been filed by these parties, we
are precluded from correcting these errors at this time.


We have corrected the error affecting Nachi by assigning to Nachi in the A-588-604 reviews of both periods
the proper rate to be used as best information available (BIA), 40.37 percent.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Background 



On December 9, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the final results of its 1990-91 and 1991-92 administrative review of the antidumpting finding on tapered
roller bearings, four inches or less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan, and the antidumping
duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished and unfinished, from Japan (58 FR 64720). 

Subsequent to the publication of the final results, the Department discovered that it had made a ministerial error
affecting Nachi. 

Section 353.28(d) of the Department's regulations defines a ``ministerial error'' as ``an error in addition, subtraction,
or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any
other type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers ministerial'' (19 CFR 353.28(d)). Although Nachi
submitted comments on November 1, 1993, concerning the rate it should receive as BIA in the A-588-604 reviews,
the Department inadvertently failed to address these comments in the final results. Nachi pointed out that the rate
of 45.95 percent, which the Department assigned to Nachi in the final results, is a rate from a previous review of the
order which was later amended to correct clerical errors. We agree with Nachi, and have assigned, as BIA, a rate of 40.37
percent to Nachi in both reviews of the A-588-604 case. 



Amended Final Results of Review 



As a result of this correction, we have determined that the rate for Nachi is 40.37 percent for tapered roller bearings
and components thereof (A-588-604) for the periods October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1991, and October
1, 1991 through September 30, 1992. 

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between the United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated
above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. 

Furthermore, the following cash deposit requirements are amended as follows: A-588-604: Nachi 40.37
percent. All other cash deposit requirements remain unchanged from the notice of December 9, 1993. 

These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until the publication of the final results of the next administrative
review. 

This amendment to the final results of administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(f)
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and section 353.28(c) of the Department's regulations (19
CFR 353.28(c)).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meetings.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NOAA makes use of a public Interagency Committee to assist in preparing for meetings of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC). This notice sets forth guidelines for participating on the Committee and a tentative schedule
of meetings and other important dates.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Secretary of Commerce is charged with the responsibility of discharging the obligations of the United States
under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946. This authority has been delegated to the
Under Secretary of NOAA. The U.S. Commissioner to the IWC has primary responsibility for the preparation and negotiation
of U.S. positions on international issues concerning whaling and for all matters involving the IWC. He is staffed
by the Department of Commerce, and assisted by the Department of State, the Department of the Interior, the Marine
Mammal Commission, and other interested agencies.


Each year, NOAA conducts a series of meetings and other actions to prepare for the annual meeting of the IWC, which is
usually held in the spring or summer. The major purpose of the preparatory meetings is to provide for input in the development
of policy by members of the public and non-governmental organizations interested in whale conservation. NOAA believes
that this participation is important for the effective development and implementation of U.S. policy concerning
whaling.
Any person with an identifiable interest in United States whale conservation policy may participate in the meetings,
but NOAA reserves the authority to inquire about the interest of any person who appears at a meeting and to determine
the appropriateness of that person's participation. Foreign nationals and persons who represent foreign governments
may not attend. These stringent measures are necessary to promote the candid exchange of information. Such measures
are a necessary basis for the relatively open process of preparing for IWC meetings that characterizes current practice.
The tentative schedule of meetings and deadlines, including those of the IWC and deadlines for the preparation of
position papers during 1994 is as follows:



January 3, 1994_Publish in the 

Federal Register 

the Agency views on: (1) The current population levels and annual net recruitment rate of bowhead whales, (2) the nature
and extent of the aboriginal/subsistence need for bowhead whales, (3) the level of take of bowhead whales that is consistent
with provisions of the IWC aboriginal/subsistence whaling management scheme, and (4) a list of documents reviewed
by NOAA and used by the Administrator in formulating these views.
January 11, 1994 (2 p.m., room 6009, Herbert C. Hoover Building, Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution, Washington,
DC)_Meeting of the Interagency Committee to review past events and to begin preparation for the 1994 Annual Meeting
of the IWC. As with all such meetings, interested persons who are unable to attend are welcome to submit comments. Recommendations
to the U.S. Commissioner should be sent to the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere at the above address.
February 1, 1994_Nominations for the U.S. Delegation to the May IWC meetings are due to the U.S. Commissioner, with
a copy to Kevin Chu at the address above. All persons wishing to be considered pursuant to the U.S. Commissioner's recommendation
to the Department of State concerning the composition of the Delegation should ensure that nominations are received
by this date. Prospective Congressional advisors to the Delegation should contact the Department of State directly.
February 20-24, 1994, Norfolk Island, Australia_Intersessional meeting of the IWC to discuss a proposal to
create a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic. (Attendance is limited to official delegations and observers from inter-governmental
organizations and non-member governments.)

DC)_Tentative Interagency Committee meeting date to review recent events relating to the IWC, to continue preparations
for the upcoming IWC Annual Meeting.
April 21, 1994 (2 p.m., room 6009, Herbert C. Hoover Building, Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution, Washington,

Whaling: Report of Independent Scientific Peer Review of the Catch Limit Algorithm of the International Whaling
Commission's Revised Management Procedure



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; availability of report.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Marine Fisheries Service has conducted an independent scientific peer review of the International
Whaling Commission's Revised Management Procedure. This notice announces the availability of the report of the
peer review panel and solicits comments on the report.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

At its 1993 Annual Meeting, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) unanimously
recommended that the Commission adopt a specific Revised Management Procedure (RMP), including a method for calculating
catch quotas for commercial whaling_the ``catch limit algorithn'' (CLA). As part of the U.S. evaluation of the proposed
procedure, NMFS conducted an independent scientific peer review of the RMP and its CLA during October 1993.





This review assessed the performance and applicability of the RMP as a management tool by considering the rationale
used to develop the RMP, the simulation trials conducted by the IWC's Scientific Committee, and the structure and
content of the various components of the RMP as a means of addressing the stated goals of the IWC. In addition, the review
addressed the data requirements for a monitoring program to assess the performance of the RMP, as was discussed by
the IWC at its 1993 Annual Meeting in Kyoto, Japan. The review did not address any other questions related to commercial
whaling or whaling policy.
The Panel concluded that the Catch Limit Algorithm (CLA) appears to be robust and conservative in meeting the stated
goals of the Commission in so far as the simulation trials that have been made to date are concerned. In the Panel's opinion,
the testing procedure used is a valid one and the set of statistical standards used was adequate. The Panel concluded
that, provided the required protocol of implementation trials and reviews is followed, the CLA could safely be used
for a short period of time, after which a thorough review would be needed. However, the Panel also agreed that the range
of simulation trials that have been made to date is not yet sufficiently extensive, in several regards, so as to gain
its full confidence. It therefore recommended that additional robustness trials be made as part of the implementation
process.

Based on the results of the peer review, the preliminary view of the National Marine Fisheries Services is that it would
seem reasonable from a scientific point of view for the IWC to adopt the RMP in principle, but that no quotas should be
calculated until the additional implementation trials called for by the peer review panel are completed.





By this notice NMFS is announcing the availability of this report and is seeking comments on it.

<USBUREAU>National Technical Information Service</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Federal Scientific, Technical, and Engineering Information Transfer; Meeting </DOCTITLE>
 


January 11, 1994. 
 
 


NTIS invites representatives of federal agencies to attend an open briefing and discussion covering the procedures,
definitions, roles, and benefits of a newly published regulation covering the transfer of Federal scientific, technical,
and engineering information (STEI). The briefing will be held at the Department of Commerce, Herbert C. Hoover Building,
room 4830, on January 26, 1994, 2 to 4 p.m.
 
Section 108 of the American Technology Preeminence Act (Pub. L. 102-245) requires all federal agencies to transfer
Government-financed STEI to the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The final rule establishing procedures
to be used was published in 

Federal Register

 (Vol. 15, No. 1, January 3, 1994, pp 6-12) as 15 CFR part 1180. The procedures become effective on February 1, 1994.

 
The purpose of the Act is to promote the national economic competitiveness of the United States and to help U.S. industries
speed the development of new products and processes. Centralized availability of Government-sponsored STEI to
industry, as well as to other users, is an important means toward this end. NTIS was created for this purpose in 1950.
Until now, the transfer of federal STEI products to NTIS was voluntary.
 
Recent policy statements have stressed the need for better dissemination of Government information, including
the President's report on Technology for America's Economic Growth and the June 1993 release of OMB Circular A-130.
The latter makes dissemination of information a responsibility of each Government agency. The procedures established
in the new regulation can aid Federal agencies to meet their obligations under these policies as well. 
 
The meeting is open to all Federal employees, but attendance is limited to 75 persons. Persons interested in attending
should contact Mr. Walter L. Finch, Associate Director for Business Development, NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,
VA 22161 (telephone: 703-487-4674). Additional briefings will be scheduled if needed.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


January 11, 1994.


Take notice that on January 7, 1994 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing as part
of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Original Sheet No. 2490, to be effective January 1, 1994.
TGPL states that the filing is being made in compliance with the Commission's December 29, 1993 letter order in this
proceeding. On December 1, 1993, TGPL submitted tariff sheets establishing a new Rate Schedule NS and associated
Form of Service Agreement, to make unbundled sales under its Order No. 636 blanket sales certificate. The December
29 letter order accepted such tariff sheets, subject to modification, to become effective on January 1, 1994. One
of the potential points of delivery described in Rate Schedule NS, as filed, was ``any point on another interstate
or intrastate pipeline''. In the December 29 letter order, the Commission found that this language ``could be interpreted
to permit (TGPL) to transport its sales gas through its system and make the sale after a delivery to a downstream LDC
or other pipeline.'' The Commission further found that ``such an interpretation, whether intentional or not, would
be inconsistent with Order No. 636.'' The December 29 letter order, therefore, required TGPL to modify Section 4 of
Rate Schedule NS to add to the point of sale definition, part (b), the language ``prior to entry into Seller's pipeline
system.'' TGPL states that Substitute Original Sheet No. 249-O reflects such modification.
TGPL states that it is serving copies of the filing on its customers, State Commissions and other interested parties.
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FDIC is submitting for OMB review changes to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) filed quarterly by insured state nonmember commercial
and savings banks. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are also
submitting these changes for OMB review for the banks under their supervision. 




The revisions to the Call Reports that are the subject of this request were approved by the FFIEC on December 16, 1993,
and are scheduled to take effect as of March 31, 1994. Unless otherwise indicated, these Call Report changes apply
to all four sets of report forms (FFIEC 031, 032, 033, and 034). Nonetheless, as is customary for Call Report changes,
banks will be advised that they may provide reasonable estimates for any of the new items in their March 31, 1994, Call
Reports for which the requested information is not readily available. The changes for which OMB approval is requested
are summarized as follows:

(1) Revisions to the reporting of securities in the following Call Report schedules to reflect the effect of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities''
(FASB 115), which banks must adopt for Call Report purposes for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993:

(a) In the body of Schedule RC-B, ``Securities,'' the amortized cost and fair value for each type of held-to-maturity
securities would be reported separately from the amortized cost and fair value for each type of available-for-sale
securities. On the FFIEC 031 report forms only, the breakdown of securities (not held in trading accounts) in domestic
offices by type of security would be moved from the body of Schedule RC-B to Schedule RC-H, ``Selected Balance
Sheet Items for Domestic Offices.''

(b) In the Memoranda section of Schedule RC-B, Memorandum items 3, ``Taxable securities issued by states and
political subdivisions in the U.S.,'' and 5, ``Debt securities held for sale,'' would be deleted. A new Memorandum
item would be added for the amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities sold or transferred during the calendar
year-to-date.

(c) On Schedule RC, ``Balance Sheet,'' item 2, ``Securities,'' would be split into separate items for ``Available-for-sale
securities'' and ``Held-to-maturity securities,'' while item 26.b would be recaptioned as ``Net unrealized holding
gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.''

(d) On Schedule RI, ``Income Statement,'' item 6, ``Gains (losses) on securities not held in trading accounts,''
would be split into separate items for realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity
securities.

(e) On Schedule RI-A, ``Changes in Equity Capital,'' item 11 would be recaptioned as ``Change in net unrealized
holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.''

(2) On Schedule RC-M, ``Memoranda,'' new items would be added for the amount of mutual funds (segregated into
four categories) and annuities sold during the quarter by the reporting bank and by third parties with whom the bank
has a contractual sales arrangement. In Schedule RI, ``Income Statement,'' a Memorandum item would be added for fee
income from the sale and servicing of mutual funds and annuities.

(3) On Schedule RC, ``Balance Sheet,'' item 16 for ``Other borrowed money'' would be split into separate subitems
for amounts with an original maturity of one year or less and for amounts with an original maturity of more than one year.
In addition, a new category of liabilities, ``Trading liabilities,'' would begin to be reported on Schedule RC.

(4) On Schedule RC-O, ``Other Data for Deposit Insurance Assessments,'' a new item would be added for ``Benefit-Responsive
`Depository Institution Investment Contracts'.''

(5) On the FFIEC 031 and 032 report forms only:

(a) Schedule RC-D would be revised to cover both trading assets and liabilities, including new items for three
categories of mortgage-backed securities, trading assets in foreign offices (on the FFIEC 031 report forms), revaluation
gains (broken down between domestic offices and foreign offices on the FFIEC 031) and revaluation losses on interest
rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity and equity contracts, and liability for short positions. In addition
to the banks with $1 billion or more in total assets that are currently required to complete Schedule RC-D, those
banks with $2 billion or more in par/notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity
and equity contracts (and less than $1 billion in total assets) will be required to complete the schedule.

(b) Schedule RC-N, which collects past due and nonaccrual data, would see the addition of new items for interest
rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity and equity contracts that are past due 30 through 89 days or past due
90 days or more. Banks would report the book value of amounts carried as assets on the balance sheet for such past due
contracts as well as the replacement cost of those past due contracts with a positive replacement cost. Consistent
with the existing treatment of Schedule RC-N data, individual bank information on contracts past due 30 through
89 days would be treated as confidential. 
 
(6) On Schedule RC-C, part I, ``Loans and Leases,'' a single total would be reported for ``Obligations (other
than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions in the U.S.'' and the separate items for taxable
and tax-exempt obligations would be eliminated. 
 
(7) Memorandum items 1 and 2 on Schedule RC-L, ``Off-Balance Sheet Items,'' which collect data on certain loan
sales and purchases during the quarter would be deleted. 
 
In addition, the general Call Report instruction precluding assets and liabilities from being offset or otherwise
netted unless specifically required by the instructions would be modified to allow on-balance sheet amounts associated
with conditional and exchange contracts (e.g., forwards, interest rate swaps, and options) to be offset in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39. This would be an interim treatment pending clarification
of an interpretive issue under Interpretation No. 39.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide
that FDA may approve applications for the export of drugs that are not currently approved in the United States. Section
802(b)(3)(B) of the act sets forth the requirements that must be met in an application for approval. Section 802(b)(3)(C)
of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine whether the requirements
of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires that the agency publish a notice
in the Federal Register within 10 days of the filing of an application for export to facilitate public participation
in its review of the application. To meet this requirement, the agency is providing notice that Merck Research Laboratories,
Division of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ 07065, has filed an application requesting approval for the export of
the bulk animal drug substance abamectin to the Netherlands where it will be further exported to Australia or New Zealand
either as the bulk material or as the formulated injectable product. The drug is administered to cattle for control
of certain internal and external parasites. The application was received and filed in the Center for Veterinary Medicine
on December 30, 1993, which shall be considered the filing date for purposes of the act.


Interested persons may submit relevant information on the application to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) in two copies (except that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found
in brackets in the heading of this document. These submissions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given, effective immediately, that the following four (4) logging roads located within the Deep
Creek Resource Area of Power and Oneida Counties are closed to all motorized vehicle traffic. 
 


Legal description of the sole point of access: 
 


1. Portage Canyon Timber Salvage Road

4. Sand Hollow Timber Salvage Road 
 


T. 10 S., R. 32 E., 
 


Section 28: SW1/4NE1/4, Boise Meridian, Power County Idaho 
 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with Title 43, CFR 8340 and in conformance with principles established by the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, the logging roads mentioned above are gated and closed to all motorized vehicle traffic. Careful
review and analysis in cooperation with the Idaho Fish and Game Department, country governments, and the public has
determined that unrestricted use of these roads by motorized vehicle traffic will significantly reduce habitat
effectiveness for upland and big game in already heavily roaded areas. All road closure(s) contained herein serve
to mitigate impacts resulting from salvage timber sales. Copies of maps indicating these road closures are posted
at the Deep Creek and Pocatello Resource Area Offices of the Idaho Bureau of Land Management. These closures are not
restricted to authorized Bureau of Land Management personnel and permitees or Idaho Fish and Game Department personnel.
This closure applies to approximately 15 miles of logging road constructed on four separate timber salvage sales.

General Leasing Policies in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Areas Under the Comprehensive Outer Continental

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On December 7, 1993 (58 FR 64409), MMS published a Call for Public Comment on general policies for leasing natural gas
and oil resources in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico planning areas. Comments were to be received by February
7, 1994. Through this notice, MMS extends the end of the comment period by 30 days, to March 9, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The basic leasing policies for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Areas were established a little more
than a decade ago. Since that time, many of the conditions facing the OCS program have changed, and MMS and the Department
of the Interior are re-evaluating leasing policies for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico sales remaining under
the Comprehensive OCS Natural Gas and Oil Resource Management Program for 1992-1997. Comments will be considered
for sales to be held subsequent to Sale 147, which is planned for Spring 1994, and will be factored into studies to determine
the effectiveness of the existing system of leasing and what alternatives are most appropriate. Neither MMS nor the
Department of the Interior has preferred alternatives, and no decisions have been made to change the existing leasing
system.



Several parties have requested that the comment period be extended by 60 days. Upon consideration of these requests,
MMS has decided that an extension of 30 days, to a total of 92 days, is appropriate. This Call for Public Comment is only
part of a continuing opportunity for correspondence and dialog between MMS and interested parties, and it should
be noted that the decision process for individual sales explicitly includes consideration of comments from outside
parties.

<DOCTITLE>RailAmerica, Inc._Control Exemption_South Central Tennessee Railroad Co. </DOCTITLE>



RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) has filed a notice of exemption to acquire control, through stock purchase, of South
Central Tennessee Railroad Company (SCTR), a class III rail carrier which operates over approximately 50 miles of
rail line in the vicinity 40 miles west of Nashville, TN, extending from Colesburg Yard, TN (at milepost 2.9) where
it interchanges with CSX Transportation, to Hohenwald, TN (at milepost 52.1). 

RailAmerica, a noncarrier holding company, also controls Huron and Eastern Railway, Inc. (HESR) and Saginaw Valley
Railway Company (SGVY).

1

 Under the terms of an agreement with Kyle Railways (Kyle), a shortline railroad holding company, RailAmerica will
purchase 100 percent of SCTR's stock, and, after consummation, RailAmerica will be in control of three non-connecting
class III rail carriers. The proposed control transaction was scheduled for consummation on or after December 31,
1993. 








RailAmerica indicates that: (1) The lines operated by SCTR do not connect with any rail lines operated by HESR or SGVY,
or its corporate family; (2) the involved transaction is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would
connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve
a class I carrier. The transaction is therefore exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See
49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). The purpose of the transaction is to preserve rail service on a light density rail line. RailAmerica
anticipates that it will be able to attract more rail service to the line than is presently being provided by offering
lower costs, more frequent service, and an increased car supply. 

As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the transaction will be protected
by the conditions set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 

360 I.C.C. 60 (1979).

2

 





Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Eric D. Gerst, General Counsel,
21 South Fifth Street, Suite 528, Philadelphia, PA 19106. 

 


Decided: January 11, 1994.

 


By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging a Final Judgment by Consent Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given that on December 30, 1993, a proposed consent decree in 

United States

 v. 

Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone, et al.,

 Civ. A. No. HAR-89-2869, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.
The complaint filed by the United States in October 1989 seeks to recover past, unreimbursed costs under Section 107
of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9607, incurred
by the United States in connection with response actions taken at the Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone Superfund Site
(``Site'') located in Elkton, Maryland. Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone Company, (``Maryland Sand Company'') the
owner and operator of the Site, was sued along with four other defendants. The proposed decree represents a partial
settlement of this case, resolving only the United States' claims for past response costs against the Maryland Sand
Company.
Under this consent decree, the Maryland Sand Company will pay the United States $25,000 in partial reimbursement
of the United States' unrecovered past response costs. The settlement is based on a demonstration by Maryland Sand
Company of its inability to reimburse the United States for any additional response costs. Under the terms of the decree,
Maryland Sand Company will also provide the United States and its representatives, including the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, access to the Site for purposes of conducting and overseeing CERCLA response activities. The
United States has specifically reserved its right to seek further relief from Maryland Sand Company on claims for
future response costs, and for claims for natural resource damages, criminal liability and other claims that are
outside of the scope of the complaint filed in this case.
The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decree for a period of thirty days
from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington,
DC 20044, and should refer to 

United States

 v. 

Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone, et al.,

 DOJ Reference No. 90-11-2-225(A).
The proposed consent decree may be examined at the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland,
U.S. Courthouse, 101 Lombard Street, Baltimore, MD 21201; Regional III Office of the Environmental Protection Agency,
841 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA.; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120 ``G'' Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington,
DC 20005, (202) 624-0892. A copy of the proposed decree may be obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree
Library at the address listed above. In requesting a copy, please refer to the referenced case and number, and enclose
a check in the amount of $4.50 (25 cents per page reproduction costs), payable to the Consent Decree Library.

<DOCTITLE>United States v. Baroid Corp., Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., DB Stratabit (USA) Inc., and Dresser Industries, Inc.;
Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h), that a proposed
Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia in 

United States of America 

v. 

Baroid Corporation; Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc.; DB Stratabit (USA) Inc.; and Dresser Industries Inc.
The Complaint of the United States in this case alleges that the merger of Dresser Industries, Inc. (``Dresser'')
and Baroid Corporation (``Baroid'') may substantially lessen competition in the United States in the manufacture
and sale of drilling fluids and in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in violation of section 7 of the Clayton
Act. Both products are used to drill oil and gas wells. Drilling fluids, a mixture of natural and synthetic chemical
compounds, are used at petrocarbon drilling sites to improve the function of the drill bit and other drilling tools
in the well, including cooling and lubricating the drill bit and controlling downhole pressures. Diamond drill bits
cut through rock and other formations during drilling operations.
Dresser, through its 64% partnership interest in M-I Drilling Fluids Co., and Baroid, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., are two of the three major U.S. producers of drilling fluids. In addition,
Dresser's Security Division and Baroid's wholly-owned subsidiary, DB Stratabit (USA) Inc., manufacture diamond
drill bits for sale in the United States. They are two of the five major competitors in the U.S. diamond drill bit market.
The proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest all of their direct and indirect ownership and control
of either Dresser's or Baroid's drilling fluid business by June 1, 1994. In addition, Defendants must, by July 1, 1994,
divest Baroid's diamond bit business, which includes a manufacturing facility, certain equipment, a nonexclusive
license of patents and other intellectual property to manufacture and sell steel-bodied diamond drill bits worldwide,
except in the People's Republic of China, and a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell matrix diamond bits in
the United States. If defendants do not complete the respective divestitures by the allotted time, a trustee or trustees
will be appointed to conduct either or both of the divestitures.
Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments,
and responses thereto, will be published in the 

Federal Register 

and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Roger W. Fones, Chief, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture
Section, Antitrust Division, room 9104, Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street NW., Washington, DC 20001 (202-307-6351).

IV



Divestiture of Drilling Fluid Business



A. Defendants are hereby ordered and directed to divest all of their direct and indirect ownership and control of the
drilling fluid business to a purchaser prior to June 1, 1994. 

B. If defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture prior to June 1, 1994, plaintiff may, in its sole discretion,
extend this time period for an additional period of time not to exceed one month. 

C. Defendants agree to take all reasonable steps to accomplish quickly said divestiture. In carrying out their obligation
to divest the drilling fluid business, defendants may divest these operations alone, or may divest along with these
operations any other assets of Baroid or Dresser. 

D. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, the defendants promptly shall make known in the
United States and in other major countries, by usual and customary means, the availability of the drilling fluid business,
for sale as an ongoing business. The defendants shall notify any person making an inquiry regarding the possible purchase
of this operation that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of the
Final Judgment. The defendants shall also offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective purchasers of the drilling
fluid business, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all pertinent information regarding the drilling
fluid business, except information subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege. Defendants
shall make available such information to the plaintiff at the same time that such information is made available to
any other person. Defendants shall permit prospective purchasers of the drilling fluid business to have access to
personnel at the drilling fluid business and to make such inspection of physical facilities and any and all financial,
operational, or other documents and information as may be relevant to the sale of the drilling fluid business. Defendants
shall not be required to permit prospective purchasers to have access to any documents or information relevant to
the drilling fluid business, except to the extent included in the drilling fluid business. 

E. Divestiture required by section IV of the Final Judgment shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy plaintiff,
in its sole discretion, that the drilling fluid business can and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable, ongoing
business engaged in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States. Divestiture shall be made to
a purchaser for whom it is demonstrated to plaintiff's satisfaction that (1) the purchase is for the purpose of competing
effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States, and (2) the purchaser has the managerial,
operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the
United States.

Fluids, or any of their affiliates of subsidiaries during the life of this decree. The purchaser of the divested drilling
fluid business shall not sell the drilling fluid business to, or combine that business with the drilling fluid operations
of, Dresser Industries, Inc., Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., or Anchor Drilling Fluids, or any of their affiliates
or subsidiaries during the life of this decree.

G. Except to the extent otherwise approved by plaintiff, any assets of the drilling fluid business divested pursuant
to this Final Judgment shall be divested free and clear of all mortgages, encumbrances and liens to Baroid or Dresser.

specifies a prompt and reasonable closing date no later than September 1, 1994, and if sale is completed pursuant to
the contract. 
 
B. If defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture prior to July 1, 1994, plaintiff may, in its sole discretion,
extend this time period for an additional period of time not to exceed three months, if defendants request such an extension
and demonstrate to plaintiff's satisfaction that they are then engaged in negotiations with a prospective purchaser
that are likely to result in the required divestiture but that the divestiture cannot be completed prior to July 1,
1994. 
 
C. Defendants agree to take all reasonable steps to accomplish quickly said divestiture. In carrying out their obligation
to divest Baroid's diamond bit business, defendants may divest these operations alone, or may divest along with these
operations any other assets of Baroid or Dresser. 
 
D. In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, the defendants promptly shall make known in the
United States and in other major countries, by usual and customary means, the availability of Baroid's diamond bit
business, for sale as an ongoing business. The defendants shall notify any person making an inquiry regarding the
possible purchase of this operation that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person
with a copy of the Final Judgment. The defendants shall also offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective purchasers
of Baroid's diamond bit business, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all pertinent information
regarding Baroid's diamond bit business, except information subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney
work product privilege. Defendants shall make available such information to the plaintiff at the same time that such
information is made available to any other person. Defendants shall permit prospective purchasers of Baroid's diamond
bit business to have access to personnel at Baroid's diamond bit business and to make such inspection of physical facilities
and any and all financial, operational, or other documents and information as may be relevant to the sale of Baroid's
diamond bit business. Defendants shall not be required to permit prospective purchasers to have access to any documents
or information relevant to Dresser's diamond bit business, except to the extent included in Baroid's diamond bit
business. 
 
E. Divestiture required by section V of the Final Judgment shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy plaintiff,
in its sole discretion, that Baroid's diamond bit business can and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable, ongoing
business engaged in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in the United States. Divestiture shall be made
to a purchaser for whom it is demonstrated to plaintiff's satisfaction that (1) the purchase is for the purpose of competing
effectively in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in the United States, including the ability to conduct
research, development, and testing of diamond bits, and (2) the purchaser has the managerial, operational, and financial
capability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in the United States. 
 
F. The defendants shall not sell Baroid's diamond bit business to Baker Hughes, Inc., Camco International, Inc.,
Smith International, Inc., or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries during the life of this decree. The purchaser
of Baroid's diamond bit business shall not sell that business to, or combine that business with the diamond drill bit
operations of, Dresser Industries, Inc., Baker Hughes, Inc., Camco, Inc., Smith International, Inc., or any of their
affiliates or subsidiaries during the life of this decree. 
 
G. Except to the extent otherwise approved by plaintiff, Baroid's diamond bit business divested pursuant to this
Final Judgment shall be divested free and clear of all mortgages, encumbrances and liens to Baroid or Dresser.

to plaintiff at such price and on such terms as are then obtainable upon a reasonable effort by the trustee, subject
to the provisions of section VIII of this Final Judgment, and shall have such other powers as this Court shall deem appropriate.
Defendants shall not object to a sale of the drilling fluids business by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's
malfeasance. Any such objection by defendants must be conveyed in writing to plaintiff and the trustee within fifteen
(15) days after the trustee has notified defendants of the proposed sale in accordance with section VIII of this Final
Judgment. 

D. The trustee shall serve at the cost and expense of defendants, shall receive compensation based on a fee arrangement
providing an incentive based on the price and terms of the divestiture and the speed with which it is accomplished,
and shall serve on such other terms and conditions as the Court may prescribe; provided, however, that the trustee
shall receive no compensation, no incur any costs or expenses, prior to the effective date of his or her appointment.
The trustee shall account for all monies derived from a sale of the drilling fluid business and all costs and expenses
incurred in connection therewith. After approval by the Court of the trustee's accounting, including fees for its
services, all remaining monies shall be paid to defendants and the trust shall then be terminated.

E. Defendants shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture of
the drilling fluid business and shall use their best efforts to assist the trustee in accomplishing the required divestiture.
The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities of the drilling fluid

Notification


Immediately following entry of a binding contract, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment,
to effect any proposed divestiture pursuant to sections IV, V, VI, or VII of this Final Judgment, defendants or the
trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify plaintiff of the proposed divestiture.
If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the
proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who
offered to, or expressed an interest in or desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the business that is the subject
of the binding contract, together with full details of same. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt by plaintiff of such
notice, plaintiff may request additional information concerning the proposed divestiture and the proposed purchaser.
Defendants and/or the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within twenty (20) days of the
receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice
or within twenty (20) days after plaintiff has been provided the additional information requested (including any
additional information requested of persons other than defendants or the trustee), whichever is later, plaintiff
shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the
proposed divestiture. If plaintiff provides written notice to defendants and/or the trustee that it does not object,
then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under the
provisions in sections VI(C) and VII(C). Absent written notice that the plaintiff does not object to the proposed
purchaser, a divestiture proposed under Section IV shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, a divestiture
proposed under section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, or by defendants under the proviso
in sections VI(C) and VII(C), a divestiture proposed under section VI or VII shall not be consummated unless approved
by the Court.

IX


Affidavits


Upon filing of this Final Judgment and every thirty (30) days thereafter until the divestitures have been completed
or authority to effect divestiture passes to the trustee pursuant to section VI or section VII of this Final Judgment,
defendants shall deliver to plaintiff an affidavit as to the fact and manner of compliance with sections IV and V of
this Final Judgment. Each such affidavit shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who,
at any time after the period covered by the last such report, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring,
entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any ownership interest
in Baroid's diamond bit business or the drilling fluid business, and shall describe in detail each contact with any
such person during that period. Defendants shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest these operations.


X


Financing


With prior consent of the plaintiff, defendants may finance all or any part of any purchase made pursuant to sections
IV, V, VI, or VII of this Final Judgment.


XI


Preservation of Assets


Until the divestitures required by the Final Judgment have been accomplished:
A. The defendants shall take all steps necessary to assure that DBS and Baroid Drilling will be maintained as separate
and independent, economically viable, ongoing businesses with their assets (including proprietary technology,
management, operations, and books and records) separate, distinct and apart from those of Dresser. The defendants
shall use all reasonable efforts on behalf of DBS to maintain and increase sales of diamond drill bits, continue its
current plans for research, development, and testing of diamond drill bits, and otherwise maintain the business
as a viable and active competitor in the United States. The defendants shall use all reasonable efforts on behalf of
Baroid Drilling and M-I Drilling Fluids Co. to maintain and increase sales of drilling fluids, continue current
plans for research, development, and testing of drilling fluids, and otherwise maintain the businesses as viable
and active competitors in the United States.
B. The defendants shall not sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or pledge as collateral for loans
(except such loans as are currently outstanding or replacements of substitutes therefore), assets required to be
divested pursuant to sections IV, V, VI, or VII except that any component of such assets as is replaced in the ordinary
course of business with a newly purchased component may be sold or otherwise disposed of, provided the newly purchased
component is so identified as a replacement component for one to be divested.
C. The defendants shall provide capital and provide and maintain sufficient working capital to maintain DBS, including
Baroid's diamond bit business; Baroid Drilling; and M-I Drilling Fluids Co. as viable, ongoing businesses
consistent with the requirements of section XI(A).
D. The defendants shall preserve the assets required to be divested pursuant to section IV, V, VI, and VII, except those
replaced with newly acquired assets in the ordinary course of business, in a state or repair equal to their state of
repair as of the date of this Final Judgment, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Defendants shall preserve the documents,
books and records of DBS and Baroid's diamond bit business until the date of divestiture of Baroid's diamond bit business,
and shall preserve the documents, books and records of Baroid Drilling and M-I Drilling Fluids Co. until the
date of divestiture of the drilling fluids business.
E. Except in the ordinary course of business, or as is otherwise consistent with the requirements of section XII, the
defendants shall refrain from terminating or altering one or more current employment, salary, or benefit agreements
for one or more executive, managerial, sales, marketing, engineering, or other technical personnel of DBS, Baroid
Drilling or 
M-I Drilling Fluids Co., and shall refrain from transferring any employee so employed without the prior approval
of plaintiff.
F. Defendants shall refrain from taking any action that would jeopardize the sale of Baroid's diamond bit business
or the drilling fluid business.


XII


Employment Offers


A. Defendants are hereby enjoined and restrained until one year following the date of divestiture from employment
of, or making offers of employment to, any person, who currently is an executive, managerial, sales, marketing, engineering,
research and development, or other technical employee of Baroid in the United States, the preponderance of whose
duties relate to Baroid's diamond bit business (``Baroid diamond bit employees''.) This provision, however, does
not apply to any employee who is terminated or not hired by the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business. Defendants
shall encourage and facilitate employment of such employees by the purchaser, and shall remove any impediments that
exist which may deter such employees from accepting employment with the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business,
including, but not limited to, the payment of all bonuses to which such employees would otherwise have been entitled
had they remained in the employment of Baroid until the end of fiscal year 1994.
B. The purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business shall also have the right to hire any person who is currently a sales,
marketing or research and development employee of Baroid, the preponderance of whose duties do not relate to Baroid's
diamond bit business. Such offers of employment and acceptances thereof, contingent upon the consummation of the
purchase of Baroid's diamond bit business, may be made prior to the consummation of the divestiture. Defendants shall
provide any prospective purchaser with cooperation and assistance in its efforts to determine which, if any, such
Baroid employees it seeks to hire. Such cooperation and assistance shall include making available for consultation
purposes to any prospective purchasers of Baroid's diamond bit business all Baroid diamond bit employees, and providing
information sufficient to enable a prospective purchaser to assess the relative performance of all Baroid sales,
marketing and research and development employees. The defendants may, prior to the time the appointment of the trustee
becomes effective pursuant to section VII, take any lawful steps they deem appropriate to retain the services of any
Baroid employees the preponderance of whose duties do not relate to Baroid's diamond bit business.

Competitive Impact Statement






Judge Sporkin
In the matter of United States of America, Plaintiff; v. Baroid Corp., Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., DB Stratabit
(USA) Inc., and Dresser Industries Inc., Defendants.



Pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA''), 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h), the
United States of America files this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted
for entry with the consent of Baroid Corporation, Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., DB Stratabit (USA) Inc., and Dresser
Industries, Inc. in this civil antitrust proceeding.


I


Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding


On December 23, 1993, the United States filed a Complaint alleging that the proposed merger of Dresser Industries,
Inc. (``Dresser'') and Baroid Corporation (``Baroid'') would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18).
The Complaint alleges that the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition in the manufacture
and sale in the United States of drilling fluids, which Dresser, through its 64 percent partnership interest in M-I
Drilling Fluids, Co. (``M-I''), and Baroid, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Baroid Drilling Fluids,
Inc. (``Baroid Drilling''), produce and sell. The Complaint also alleges that the effect of the merger may be substantially
to lessen competition in the manufacture and sale in the United States of diamond drill bits, which both Dresser's
Security Division (``Security'') and Baroid's wholly owned subsidiary DB Stratabit (USA) Inc. (``DBS'') manufacture
and sell. Both drilling fluids and diamond drill bits are used by energy exploration and development companies to
drill oil and gas wells. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, a permanent injunction preventing defendants from,
in any manner, combining their drilling fluid and diamond drill bit businesses.
On December 23, 1993, the United States and defendants filed a stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a
proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the merger. Under the proposed Final
Judgment, as explained more fully below, defendants would be required to sell, by June 1, 1994, either Baroid Drilling
or Dresser's interest in M-I. By July 1, 1994, defendants would also have to divest Baroid's domestic diamond
drill bit business, including a manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, as well as licenses for DBS patents and technology
to make and sell DBS diamond drill bits domestically and to a significant extent throughout the world. If defendants
should fail to complete either or both of the divestitures, a trustee appointed by the Court would be empowered to complete
them.

The United States, Dresser, and Baroid have agreed that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance
with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction
to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment. 


II 



Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation 



On September 7, 1993, Dresser and Baroid entered into a purchase agreement under which the two companies would merge
and Baroid would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dresser. This acquisition would, if unchallenged, effectively
merge all of the businesses of Dresser and Baroid, including their drilling fluid and diamond drill bit businesses.
The purchase price is approximately $900 million. 

Dresser and Baroid are both large, diversified oil field service companies that provide a wide variety of products
and services necessary to explore for and develop oil and gas reserves. Dresser reported total 1992 sales of about
$3.8 billion; Baroid's total 1992 sales were approximately $614.4 million. 

The Complaint alleges that there are two markets in which Dresser and Baroid are significant competitors. Those two
markets are the manufacture and sale in the United States of drilling fluids and the manufacture and sale in the United
States of diamond drill bits. 

Both products are used by drilling operators to drill for oil and gas. Wells are drilled using a drill pipe (or ``drill
string''), which is a heavy-walled pipe assembled end-to-end from thirty- to forty-foot sections. The drill string
is suspended from the mast of a drilling rig and lowered gradually as the earth is penetrated. As the drill string is
rotated, the earth is cut by a drill bit,
 which is attached to the end of the drill string or to a motor that is attached to the end of the drill string. Drilling
fluid is pumped under pressure through the drill string to the drill bit at the end of the string. Drilling fluid, a mixture
of natural and synthetic chemical compounds (principally barite and bentonite), improves the performance and durability
of the drill string and the tools in the hole by, for example, cooling and lubricating the drill bit and controlling
downhole pressure. 





Both drilling fluids and diamond drill bits are critical products for oil and gas exploration and development. The
use of an incorrectly formulated drilling fluid can result in a costly, dangerous hole blow-out or the immobilization
of the drill string. The percentage of total drilling costs accounted for by drilling fluids can be as high as 10 percent.
The percentage of total drilling costs accounted for by drill bits is less, usually no more than 5 percent, but the cost
of a bit failure can be very high. Valuable drilling time is lost because the entire drill string must be pulled out of
the hole, disassembled, a new bit attached, and the drill string reassembled and run back into the hole. 

M-I is a vertically integrated company with mining operations, manufacturing plants, research and engineering
facilities, distribution facilities and sales and service centers located throughout the world. M-I's worldwide,
net sales of drilling fluids for fiscal year 1992 and $383.6 million. Its domestic sales were approximately $110 million.
Baroid Drilling produces and sells drilling fluids through a distribution network consisting of approximately
150 onshore and offshore stockpoints and over 50 field laboratories. In 1992, Baroid Drilling's worldwide, net sales
were $331.5 million, and its domestic sales were approximately $100 million.

Dresser's Security Division has a diamond drill bit manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. Dresser's total 1992
worldwide sales of diamond drill bits were about $10.4 million and its U.S. sales of that product were about $4.7 million.
Baroid produces diamond drill bits at manufacturing facilities located in Houston, Texas, Brussels, Belgium, and
Leduc, Alberta, Canada. Baroid's 1992 worldwide sales of diamond drill bits were approximately $40 million, and
its domestic sales were about $3.6 million. Baroid's domestic diamond drill bit operations are handled through its
DBS subsidiary.

The Complaint alleges that the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids is a relevant product market for antitrust
purposes. A small, significant nontransitory price increase would not cause customers to use another product instead
of drilling fluid. The United States is a relevant geographic market for the drilling fluid market within the meaning
of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Complaint states that this market is highly concentrated and would become substantially
more concentrated as a result of the merger of Baroid and Dresser. Three companies dominate the drilling fluid business
in the United States, including M-I and Baroid Drilling. Based on 1992 sales data, 

M-I was the largest firm in the drilling fluid market, accounting for about 29 percent of sales, while Baroid
Drilling, the second largest firm, accounted for about 22 percent. The merger of Dresser and Baroid would increase
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index by about 1200 points to a post-acquisition level of more than 2800 points. The merger
of Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the drilling fluid market by enabling the remaining competitors
more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms customers.
The increase in concentration will result in higher prices for drilling fluids, which will increase the costs of oil
and gas exploration and development in the United States. 




Successful new entry into the United States drilling fluid market is difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, the
expansion of fringe firms would be insufficient to counteract or deter a small but significant nontransitory price
increase. To gain a significant market share, a firm must have an adequate, reliable, and independent source of barite
and bentonite and a significant research and development capability. Because the costs to the customer of product
failure are so high, the firm must also have a reputation for providing a reliable product and dependable service.
The establishment of such a reputation takes years and requires a significant investment of resources.

The Complaint also alleges that the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits is a relevant product market for antitrust
purposes. A small, significant nontransitory increase in the price of diamond drill bits would not cause customers
to use another product. The United States is a relevant geographic market for this product market within the meaning
of section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Complaint states that this market is concentrated, with five companies, including
Dresser and Baroid, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all diamond drill bit sales in the United States. These
five companies have established reputations for providing dependable diamond drill bits for almost all types of
drilling operations, backed by extensive product research, development, and testing. For a significant number
of drilling projects, only these five companies have the product quality, performance record, and engineering support
required to be considered by customers as a supplier of diamond drill bits.

The United States diamond drill bit market would become significantly more concentrated as a result of the merger
of Dresser and Baroid. Based on 1992 sales data, Dresser was the third largest firm in the diamond drill bit market,
accounting for about 13 percent of sales, while Baroid, the fifth largest firm, accounted for about 10 percent. The
merger of Dresser and Baroid would result in a competitor having almost 25 percent of U.S. diamond drill bit sales,
and would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman index by more than 250 points to a post-acquisition level of more than
2300. As a result of the acquisition, four firms would account for approximately 90 percent of sales. The merger of
Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the United States diamond drill bit market by enabling the remaining
competitors more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms
customers. This increase in concentration would result in higher prices for diamond drill bits, which will increase
the cost of oil and gas exploration and development in the United States. 


Entry into the United States market for diamond drill bits is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. To enter
the diamond drill bit market and gain a significant market share, a firm must build a manufacturing and research and
development facility, develop diamond bits, and establish a reputation for the efficiency, durability, and reliability
of its product under actual drilling conditions in a wide variety of different geographic and geological conditions.
Because the performance of a bit is critical to assuring the lowest possible drilling costs, and the risk of financial
loss due to bit failure is substantial, customers are generally very reluctant to purchase bits from a new supplier
that lacks a proven performance record. It would take several years and significant investment for a new supplier
to establish a performance record and obtain the sales that are necessary to support the substantial engineering,
technical services, and research and development capabilities possessed by the five major competitors in this market.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment



The United States brought this action because the effect of the proposed merger of Dresser and Baroid may be substantially
to lessen competition, in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, in the United States for the manufacture and sale
of drilling fluids and the manufacture and sale of diamond bits. The risk to competition posed by this transaction,
however, would be substantially eliminated were defendants to divest either Baroid Drilling or Dresser's interest
in M-I, and Baroid's diamond bit business, as defined in the proposed Final Judgment, to a purchaser or purchasers
that would operate the businesses as active, independent, and financially viable United States competitors in the
respective product markets. To this end, the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment are designed to accomplish
the sale of a drilling fluid business as well as the sale of Baroid's diamond bit business and to prevent the anticompetitive
effects of the proposed acquisition.

Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest the ``drilling fluid business'' by June 1,
1994, to a purchaser that has the intent and capability to compete promptly and effectively in the manufacture and
sale of drilling fluids in the United States. The ``drilling fluid business'' is defined in the proposed Final Judgment
as either Dresser's 64 percent interest in M-I, or all assets of Baroid Drilling and any other assets that Baroid
owns or has an interest in that are used to research, develop, test, produce, manufacture, service or market, domestically
or internationally, drilling fluids. If the divestiture has not occurred by June 1, 1994, the United States may, in
its sole discretion, extent the time period up to one month. The proposed Final Judgment prohibits the sale by the defendants
of the drilling fluid business to their major competitors in the drilling fluid market: Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger
Ltd., and Anchor Drilling Fluids. This prohibition lasts for the life of the decree. The purchaser of the drilling
fluid business is also prohibited from combining that business with the drilling operations of any of those three
companies or Dresser. 

Section V of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest ``Baroid's diamond bit business'' by July
1, 1994, to a purchaser that has the intent and capability to compete promptly and effectively in the manufacture and
sale of diamond bits in the United States. ``Baroid's diamond bit business'' is defined in the proposed Final Judgment
as the assets owned or controlled by Baroid that are or have been used in the United States to research, develop, test,
manufacture, service or market its diamond drill bits. The assets to be divested include Baroid's diamond bit manufacturing
facility in Houston, Texas, all equipment in that plant, and all equipment owned or controlled by Baroid that was used
to manufacture matrix diamond bits.
 Baroid's diamond bit business also includes a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell matrix diamond bits in
the United States and a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell steel-bodied diamond bits anywhere in the world,
except The People's Republic of China, using all patents and other intellectual property owned or controlled by Baroid.
These licenses will allow the purchaser to be an effective competitor in the United States diamond drill bit market.
The business divested will additionally include research and development equipment in the Houston plant and access
for two years to certain pieces of research and development equipment in Baroid's Belgium facility, as well as data
from almost all research and development projects relating to matrix or steel-bodied drill bits undertaken by Baroid
up to and including the date of the divestiture. Research and development of diamond drill bits includes, but is not
limited to, engineering support relating to the analysis and testing of a diamond drill bit's design, application,
and components in order to enhance the bit's performance or to create a new diamond bit. In addition, Baroid's diamond
bit business includes all data recording diamond bit performance in Baroid's possession at the date of divestiture.
The purchaser also has the right for two years to market its diamond bits as being manufactured pursuant to a license
from DBS but will not have the right to use the trade names of ``Stratabit,'' ``DB Stratabit, Inc.,'' ``Diamont Boart,''
``DBS,'' or any derivative thereof. The licenses granted need not be transferable, and thus remain with the original
purchaser in perpetuity unless transferred in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of Baroid's diamond
bit business.

The divestiture requirement will be satisfied if the defendants have entered a binding contract to sell Baroid's
diamond bit business by July 1, 1994, as long as the divestiture will be completed by September 1, 1994. Also, if the
defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture by July 1, but demonstrate to the United States' satisfaction
that they are then engaged in negotiations with a prospective purchaser that are likely to result in the required divestiture,
the United States may extend the time period for divestiture up to three more months. The defendants are prohibited
by the proposed Final Judgment from selling Baroid's diamond bit business to their major competitors in the diamond
drill bit market: Baker Hughes, Inc., Smith International, Inc., and Camco International, Inc. That prohibition
lasts for the life of the decree. The purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business is also prohibited from combining
that business with the diamond drill bit operations of any of those companies or Dresser for the life of the decree.

Under the proposed Final Judgment, defendants must take all reasonable steps necessary to accomplish both divestitures
quickly, and shall cooperate with bona fide prospective purchasers by supplying all information relevant to the
proposed sale. Should defendants fail to complete the divestitures by the specified deadlines to purchasers approved
by the United States, the proposed Final Judgment provides for the appointment by the Court of a trustee or trustees
to accomplish either or both of the divestitures. Section VI relates to the selection and appointment of a trustee
to sell the drilling fluid business, and section VII relates to the selection and appointment of a trustee to sell Baroid's
diamond bit business. Following the trustee's appointment, only to trustee will have the right to sell the assets
to be divested, and defendants will be required to pay for all of the trustee's sale-related expenses. Should the trustee
not accomplish the divestiture it is empowered to make within six months of appointment, the trustee and the parties
will make recommendations to the Court, which shall enter such orders as it deems appropriate to carry out the purpose
of the trust, which may include extending the trust or the term of the trustee's appointment. If a trustee is appointed
to sell Baroid's diamond bit business, that business will include a license to manufacture and sell Baroid's steel-bodied
diamond bits anywhere in the world, including The People's Republic of China.

Section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment requires that the defendants or the trustee, whoever is responsible for
accomplishing the divestiture at the time, notify the United States when a binding contract has been entered so that
the United States has an opportunity to evaluate the purchaser. This section gives the United States the right to obtain
information about the perspective purchaser. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the
proposed purchaser of the drilling fluid business, a divestiture of that business under section IV cannot be consummated.
Upon the United States' objection to the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business under section V, the transaction
cannot be consummated. Should the United States object to a sale of either business by the trustee, the divestiture
cannot be consummated unless approved by the Court.

Section IX of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to submit monthly reports to the United States regarding
its efforts to divest the drilling fluid business and Baroid's diamond bit business, including the status of discussions
or negotiations with any person. Section X states that defendants may finance part of all of either divestiture with
the prior consent of the United States. Under section XI of the proposed Final Judgment, defendants must take certain
steps to ensure that, until the required divestiture has been completed, Baroid Drilling and DBS will be held separate
and apart from Dresser and that both businesses, as well as 

M-I, will be maintained as viable competitors.



The proposed Final Judgment also contains provisions designed to ensure that the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit
business will have the opportunity to hire a work force sufficient to maintain that business as an effective competitor
in the United States. Under section XII of the proposed Final Judgment, defendants are required to encourage and facilitate
employment by the purchaser of all Baroid employees in the United States, the preponderance of whose duties relate
to Baroid's diamond bit business, and will be prohibited from employing these individuals for one year after the divestiture
unless those individuals are terminated or not hired by the purchaser. In addition, defendants are required to assist
the purchaser so that the purchaser may determine if it would like to hire other Baroid sales, marketing and research
and development employees, the preponderance or whose duties do not relate to Baroid's diamond drill bit business.
This assistance consists of providing information and consultation regarding the employees' relative job duties
and performance.

Finally, section XV provides that the proposed Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry by
the Court.

IV


Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants


Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15) provides that any person who has just been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as
well as costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist
the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.
16(a)), the proposed Final Judgment has no 

prima facie

 effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought against defendants.


V


Procedure Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment


The United States and defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after
compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent. The APPA
conditions entry upon the Court's determination that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.
The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which
any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who
wishes to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the


Federal Register

. The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it would withdraw its consent, and respond to comments.
The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the 

Federal Register

.
Written comments should be submitted to: Roger W. Fones, Chief Transportation, Energy & Agriculture Section,
Antitrust Division, Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street, NW., room 9104, Washington, DC 20001.


VI


Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment


The proposed Final Judgment requires that either Dresser's interest in M-I or Baroid Drilling, and Baroid's
diamond bit business be sold to a purchaser or purchasers that would use the respective businesses promptly to become
viable competitors in both of the product markets alleged in the Complaint. Thus, compliance with the proposed Final
Judgment and the completion of the divestitures required by the Judgment would resolve the competitive concerns
raised by the proposed transaction, and assure that the respective businesses would remain independent and active
competitors to Dresser's drilling fluid and diamond bit businesses in the United States.
Litigation is, of course, always an alternative to a consent decree in a section 7 case. The United States rejected
this alternative because the divestitures required under the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the merger
of Dresser and Baroid from having a significant anticompetitive effect in either of the two relevant product markets
alleged, and will provide substantially all of the relief requested in the Complaint. The United States believes
that in the hands of appropriate purchasers, the drilling fluid business that is divested and Baroid's diamond bit
business will likely maintain their respective competitive roles in the United States.
The United States is satisfied that the proposed Final Judgment fully resolves the anticompetitive effects of the
proposed merger alleged in the Complaint. Although the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered until the criteria
established by the APPA (115 U.S.C. 15 (b)-(h)) have been satisfied, the public will benefit immediately from
the safeguards in the proposed Final Judgment because the defendants have stipulated to comply with the terms of the
Judgment pending its entry by the Court.


VII


Determinative Materials and Documents


There are no materials or documents that the United States considered to be determinative in formulating this proposed
Final Judgment. Accordingly, none are being filed with this Competitive Impact Statement.

Cascade West Sportswear, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the Plan) Located in Puyallup, WA



[Application No. D-9414]



Proposed Exemption



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale for cash of certain limited partnership units (the Units) from the Plan to
Cascade West Sportswear, Inc. (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following
conditions are met: 

1. The fair market value of the Units is established by an appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer; 

2. The Employer pays the greater of $131,560 or the current fair market value of the Units plus an ``opportunity loss''
of no less than $171,000; 

3. The sale is a one-time transaction for cash; and 

4. The Plan pays no commissions or other expenses in relation to the sale. 



Summary of Facts and Representations



1. The Employer is engaged in the business of outerwear garment manufacturing. Eric Hilf, a 50-percent shareholder
of the Employer, is the trustee of the Plan. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which had approximately 119 participants
and total assets of $221,364 as of December 31, 1992. The board of directors of the Employer voted in 1992 to terminate
the Plan. The last contribution to the Plan was made for the Plan year ended December 31, 1992. 

2. In July 1980 the Plan acquired the Units which represented a 28.6 percent interest in the Good Sam Investors limited
partnership (the Partnership). Following its formation, the Partnership acquired an undeveloped parcel of real
estate (the Property) near downtown Puyallup, Washington. The Plan initially paid $51,667 for the Units. Since the
purchase of the Units, the Plan has contributed additional amounts to the Partnership for its share of the carrying
costs of the Property. The Plan also borrowed money from an unrelated commercial bank to pay off the Plan's share of
the original seller-financed acquisition of the Property by the Partnership. The Partnership has made a distribution
to the Plan totaling $49,028. Net of such distributions, the total amount expended by the Plan in regard to acquiring
and holding the Units (including the above $51,667) was $239,730 as of December 31, 1992.

3. The Plan acquired the Units because they originally appeared to represent a good investment. The applicant represents
that neither the Employer nor any of its officers has invested separately in the Partnership. The other investors
in the Units are unrelated parties. The Property is not adjacent to any property owned by the Employer and has not been
used by the Employer or any other party in interest with respect to the Plan since the time of the purchase of the Units.


Several business and residential developments in the area near the Property were underway at the time the Partnership
was formed. The Partnership consulted with real estate and engineering firms during the early 1980s to determine
the requirements to make the Property salable at an attractive price. However, the City of Puyallup later withdrew
a determination statement which would have permitted development of the Property. In 1986 the Partnership sold a
portion of the Property to an unrelated party for $180,000, resulting in the above mentioned distribution of $49,028
to the Plan. Since then the Partnership has listed the Property on three occasions with three different real estate
brokers but has been unable to sell the Property. A significant portion of the Property has now been classified as wetlands
and cannot be developed without substantial additional expense. Plan fiduciaries have concluded that the Property
could not be sold to an unrelated party without a substantial price concession or considerable additional expense.

4. The Plan obtained an appraisal on the Property dated March 12, 1993, from Roger D. Ockfen, MAI (Ockfen), a real estate
appraiser located in Tacoma, Washington. The applicant represents that Ockfen is independent of the Plan and the
Employer. Placing emphasis on the comparable sales approach to value, Ockfen estimated the fair market value of the
usable land area of the Property as of February 18, 1993, to be approximately $460,000. Based on this amount, the value
of the Units representing the Plan's 28.6 percent interest in the Partnership totaled $131,560. 

5. The applicant represents that there is no market for the Units and that they are not expected to appreciate in value.
However, the Plan cannot make liquidating distributions to its participants without first selling the Units. Accordingly,
the Plan proposes to sell the Units to the Employer. The Employer will pay the Plan the greater of $131,560 or the fair
market value of the Units as of the date of sale, based on an updated independent appraisal of the Property, in addition
to an ``opportunity loss'' of approximately $171,000. The ``opportunity loss'' amount, to be adjusted at the time
of sale, was calculated assuming a six percent annual rate of return on the Plan's investment in the Partnership since
the initial time of that investment. 

The total payments to the Plan will thus exceed the Plan's original acquisition and subsequent net carrying costs
of the Units (which totaled $239,730 at the end of 1992). The sale of the Units will be a one-time transaction for cash
and the Plan will pay no commissions or fees in regard to the transaction. The applicant represents that any amounts
received by the Plan as a result of the proposed transaction which are in excess of the fair market value of the Units
will be treated as a contribution to the Plan. However, such contribution will not exceed the limitations of section
415 of the Code. 

6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) The fair market value of the Units will be established by an appraiser independent of
the Employer; (2) the Employer will pay the greater of $131,560 or the fair market value of the Units on the date of sale
plus an ``opportunity loss'' of approximately $171,000; (3) the sale will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(4) the transaction will remove from the Plan an investment which is not liquid and which is not expected to appreciate
in value.

The Department of the Treasury has determined that, if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and
its sponsoring employer (or affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less or receiving more than fair
market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan and thus must
be examined under the applicable provisions of the Code, including sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415.

Jim Birdsall, the president of Nor Star Machine Tools, Inc. located in Bellevue, Washington, appraised the Finn-Power
FMC Line. Mr. Birdsall represents that he has experience with Finn-Power presses and the present market for this type
of equipment. Mr. Birdsall represents that both he and Nor Star Machine Tools, Inc. are unrelated to and independent
of the Employer. In an appraisal report dated June 4, 1993, Mr. Birdsall placed the fair market value of the Finn-Power
FMC Line at $792,000, approximately eighty percent of its acquisition price of $990,000. 
In a subsequent letter dated December 3, 1993, Mr. Birdsall describes certain factors he considered in determining
the fair market value. Mr. Birdsall states that the twenty percent discount of the acquisition price is attributable
to two years of equal amounts of depreciation on the Finn-Power FMC Line. 
Theodore Egleston, a national sales manager for E.W. Bliss Company located in Hastings, Michigan, appraised the
Bliss 500 ton press. Mr. Egelston states that he has twenty-five years of experience in appraising used Bliss equipment
for insurance companies and lending institutions. Mr. Egelston represents that he is unrelated to and independent
of the Employer. In appraisal reports dated July 12, 1993 and December 3, 1993, Mr. Egleston placed the fair market
value of the Bliss 500 ton press at $436,000, or eighty-four percent of its $520,000 acquisition price. Mr. Egelston's
valuation takes into consideration six years of equal amounts of depreciation on the Bliss 500 ton press's acquisition
price. 
7. Mr. Starr will serve as the qualified, independent fiduciary for the Plan with respect to the New Loan. Mr. Starr
represents that he has extensive experience in business and loan transactions. Mr. Starr represents that he is unrelated
to and independent of the Employer and its affiliates, including 
Mr. Linton. Mr. Starr states that he understands and acknowledges his duties, responsibilities, and liabilities
in acting as a fiduciary with respect to the Plan, based upon consultation with counsel experienced with the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of the Act. 
Mr. Starr represents that all payments under the Original Loan have been paid in a timely manner and that there have
been no delinquencies. Mr. Starr also states that the collateral to loan ratio under the Original Loan has always been
maintained. 
Mr. Starr has reviewed the terms of the New Loan and all of the documents and relevant information in connection with
the New Loan, including the Appraisals. Mr. Starr states that the terms of the New Loan compare favorably with the terms
of similar transaction between unrelated parties and would be an arm's-length transaction as evidenced by the terms
offered by CityBank (see Item 

#4

 above). In addition, Mr. Starr adds that the Loan will be secured by a first lien interest on the Equipment, which has
been valued in excess of 200 percent of the New Loan amount. Mr. Starr acknowledges his responsibility to quarterly
review the Loan and make the necessary adjustments to the interest rate based upon the prime rate of CityBank. 
Mr. Starr has reviewed the current investment portfolio of the Plan and considered the diversification of the Plans
assets as well as the liquidity needs of the Plan. Based on this analysis, Mr. Starr believes that the proposed transaction
would be in the best interest of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries as an investment for the Plan's portfolio.

Mr. Starr states that the New Loan would be an appropriate and desirable investment for the plan, based on the New Loan's
rate of return, the collateral securing the New Loan, the character and diversification of the Plan's other assets,
and the projected liquidity needs of the Plan. 
Mr. Starr has reviewed the financial condition of the Employer in order to establish its ability to repay the New Loan.
In this regard, Mr. Starr states that he has examined the most recent financial statements from the Employee and its
credit history. Mr. Starr concludes that the Employer is credit-worthy and, based upon its current ratio and current
assets to debt ratio, is financially capable of making the monthly payments required by the New Loan without such payments
having an adverse impact on its cash flow. 
Mr. Starr represents that he will monitor the New Loan through its entire duration and will take any appropriate action
necessary to protect the interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, include a foreclosure on the
Equipment in event of default. Mr. Starr will monitor the condition and adequacy of the Equipment as collateral for
the Plan to ensure that the New Loan remains secured by collateral worth at least 200 percent of the New Loan at all times.

Mr. Starr will monitor the Plan's assets to ensure that the amount of the Plan's assets will at all times remain less
than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. Mr. Starr will require the Employer to provide additional payments
on the New Loan to the Plan, if necessary, to reduce the principal amount of the New Loan to maintain an appropriate ratio
between the outstanding principal balance of the New Loan and the Plan's total assets. Mr. Starr has acknowledged
his responsibility to monitor compliance of all parties with terms and conditions of the proposed exemption, including
the twenty-five percent limitation. 
8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The terms of the New Loan will be at least as favorable to the Plan as those
obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the New Loan will not exceed twenty-five percent
of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the New Loan; (c) the New Loan will be secured by a first lien
interest on the Equipment, which has been appraised by a qualified, independent appraiser to ensure that the fair
market value of the Property is at least 200 percent of the amount of the New Loan; (d) the fair market value of the Equipment
will remain at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of the New Loan throughout the duration of the New
Loan; (e) Mr. Starr, as independent, qualified fiduciary for the Plan, will determine that the New Loan is in the best
interests of the Plan and protective of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries; and (f) Mr. Starr will monitor
compliance by the Employer with the terms and conditions of the New Loan and the exemption throughout the duration
of the transaction, taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Equipment
in the event of default.

Jacobs Corporation Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the Plan) 
Located in Harlan, IA 


[Application No. D-9561] 


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedure set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10,
1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section 406(a) and 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions
resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code
shall not apply to the proposed cash sale of certain assets of the Plan (the Assets), to occur over two (2) consecutive
years, by the Plan to the Jacobs Corporation (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan; provided
that: (1) The aggregate purchase price paid by the Employer for all of the Assets is no less than $683,384; (2) the purchase
price paid by the Employer in each of the two consecutive years will be at least $341,692; (3) the purchase price paid
by the Employer in each of the two consecutive years upon execution of the sale of such Assets is not less than the fair
market value of such Assets on the date of each sale; (4) the terms of each of the sales are no less favorable to the Plan
than those negotiated in similar circumstances with unrelated third parties; and (5) the Plan will incur no fees,
commissions, or expenses as a result of either of the sales.

Temporary Nature of Exemption 


The proposed exemption is temporary and, if granted, will become effective on the date of publication of the grant
of this proposed exemption in the 

Federal Register

 and will expire upon the earlier to occur of the date which is two years from the grant of this proposed exemption or the
date when the Plan no longer owns any of the Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan which provides for employee contributions to be held in employee
directed accounts, pursuant to section 401(k) of the Code. As of December 31, 1991, there were 62 participants in the
Plan. The assets of the Plan consist of the Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption and certain guaranteed
insurance contracts (GICs). It is represented that, as of September 30, 1993, the value of all of the assets held in
the Plan was approximately $1,549,134.

The Employer and sponsor of the Plan is an Iowa corporation, with offices in Harlan, Iowa. The Employer is engaged in
the manufacture of mill supplies and trencher parts. Todd Plumb is the sole shareholder of the common stock of the Employer.
Since 1990, Todd Plumb has served as the sole trustee for the Plan. Prior to that time, the trustees of the Plan were the
Southgate Trust Company, Todd Plumb, and Max Plumb. Further, the GICs were held on behalf of the Plan in the past by Southgate
Trust and are now held by First Trust MidAmerica. Norwest Bank Iowa, N.A., located in Des Moines, Iowa is currently
acting as administrator of the Plan and will assume the duties of trustee of the Plan, as soon as this proposed exemption
is granted. 

2. It is represented that since 1983, the Plan held participation interests in a fund which provided debt financing
to a series of separate trusts (the Trusts) which engaged in commercial real estate development. In addition, since
1984, the Plan also held equity participation interests in such Trusts. In October 1985, all of the Trusts were merged
into the Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII in which the Plan retained ownership interests. Subsequently, on December
15, 1988, Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII was converted into a Master Mortgage Investment Fund, Inc., a real estate
investment trust (the REIT). The Plan acquired the Assets through certain transfers of the Plan's holdings in Master
Mortgage Fund Trust VII to the REIT.

3. The Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption consist of the Plan's holdings of participation interests
in three funds (the Funds). One of the Funds holds the Preferred Stock of the REIT (the Preferred Fund), another holds
Common Stock of the REIT (the Common Fund), and the third fund (the Secured Note I Fund; formerly the Guaranteed Plus
Fund) holds notes of the REIT collateralized by mortgages. The REIT, a Delaware corporation, has offices in Overland
Park, Kansas. The investors in the REIT include the Plan and other qualified retirement plans. The REIT was organized
for the primary purpose of realizing income from investing in and originating short-term loans, junior real estate
mortgage loans, wrap around mortgage loans, first mortgage loans with and without participation features, construction
loans and pre-development loans to real estate developers, secured by income producing real property. 

The REIT completed its initial one-year public offering on November 18, 1989, selling a total of 2,756,474 shares
of preferred stock (the Preferred Stock) and 841,542 shares of common stock (the Common Stock) for subscriptions
in the amount of $35,980,160. As of December 31, 1990, the REIT had 2,491,522 shares of Preferred Stock and 1,308,669
shares of Common Stock outstanding. It is represented that the change in outstanding stock of the REIT reflects shares
issued under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the conversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. 

4. It is represented that between 1984 and 1990, the rate of return received by the Plan on its interest in these Assets
or in the Trusts fluctuated from a high of 15.8% in 1984 to a low of 5.8% in 1990. During the period between 1983 to 1991,
the percentage of the Plan's portfolio involved with these Assets or with the Trusts varied from a low of 8.66% in 1983,
to a high of 63% in October 1991. Through its investment in the Preferred Fund, the Plan owns approximately 43,848 shares
of Preferred Stock of the REIT, as of December 31, 1992. Likewise, through its investment in the Common Fund, the Plan
owns approximately 211 shares of Common Stock of the REIT, as of the same date. 

5. The Secured Note I Fund was established on January 31, 1988, by Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII for the purpose of providing
secured debt financing to the related Trusts. After the REIT was established in 1989, the Secured Note I Fund offered
a $10,000,000 line of credit to the REIT. Under this line of credit, as of December 31, 1990, the Secured Note I Fund had
extended $8,344,522 to the REIT, payable on January 31, 1991. Due to the inability of the REIT to repay this debt on January
31, 1991, the Secured Note I Fund again extended credit to the REIT, in the form of two notes (the Notes) in the amounts,
respectively, of $1,677,044 and $6,805,340 and extended the date of repayment under the terms of these Notes to January
310, 1992, which in turn was extended to January 31, 1993. It is represented that as of September 7, 1993, the Notes had
not been repaid. 

The Notes bear interest at nine percent (9%) per annum adjusted from time to time in accordance with certain interest
rates charged by the Merchants Bank of Kansas City and are collateralized by the assets of the REIT, primarily mortgages
which are subordinated to unrelated third party notes. The total outstanding balance of these Notes, as of September
30, 1991, was $8,862,016. 

The Plan acquired a participation interest in the Secured Note I Fund as a result of a transfer of funds from the Master
Mortgage Fund VII at the end of 1989, and another such transfer from the Preferred Fund at the beginning of 1990. 

6. On April 17, 1992, the Board of Directors of the REIT unanimously approved the filing by the REIT for financial reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Since that time the REIT has been operating as debtor-in-possession
under the protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. On its balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 1992, the
REIT lists total assets of $23,321,456 and total liabilities of $18,814,132. 

7. The Employer has proposed to purchase the Plan's interests in the Preferred Fund, the Common Fund, and the Secured
Note I Fund. It is represented that there is no market for the Assets and that the income potential and the market value
of such Assets has declined. Further, Todd Plumb, as trustee for the Plan, has been repeatedly unsuccessful in attempting
to sell such Assets to a third party purchaser or in having the Assets redeemed by the REIT. For this reason, the applicant
believes it will be in the best interest of the Plan to invest the proceeds of the Asset sales to the Employer in other
securities, the return rate of which will significantly exceed the rate of earnings on the Assets. It is represented
that, if such Assets were retained in the Plan, there may not be sufficient liquidity in the Plan to pay cash to beneficiaries
or to participants withdrawing from the Plan. In this regard, the sales of the Assets to the Employer will avoid an in-kind
distribution of an undivided interest in the Assets to the participants and beneficiaries which would have no immediate
value and little long term value. The Assets are valued at a book value to the Plan of $683,384, as of June 30, 1993. In
accordance with this value, as of September 30, 1993, the Assets represented approximately 44% of the assets of the
Plan. The applicant represents that the book value is approximately the amount invested by the Plan in the Assets.

<TEXT>
 

The Employer proposes, over a period of two (2) years, to purchase annually a portion of such Assets at a price each year
of $341,692. This amount is one half of the book value of the Assets, as of June 30, 1993. It has been represented that
immediately following the execution of the first sale of the Assets to the Employer, the book value of the Assets remaining
in the Plan will constitute no more than 22.06% of the assets held at that time by the Plan, without taking into consideration
in determining the value of the Plan's assets either projected contributions by the Employer or by its employees or
anticipated income to the Plan from other assets. The Employer has agreed to pay the costs of the exemption application,
including providing notice to all interested persons. Further, it is represented that the Plan will incur no fees,
commissions, or expenses as a result of the sales of the Assets to the Employer. 
8. In an appraisal, dated September 7, 1993, Cyril Ann Mandelbaum, CPA (Ms. Mandelbaum) estimated the fair market
value of the Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption. Ms. Mandelbaum represents that she is qualified
to appraise the Assets in that she is a certified public accountant and a member of the American Society of Appraisers.
Further, Ms. Mandelbaum represents her independence in that she does not have any present or contemplated future
interest in the Assets or any other interest which might tend to prevent her from making a fair and unbiased appraisal
of such Assets. According to Ms. Mandelbaum, the estimated value of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock is $1.19
and $1.18 per share, respectively. Taking into consideration a 28% discount for the minority interest held by the
Plan in the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock and a discount of 35% for the lack of marketability of such stock, Ms.
Mandelbaum reached a value for the Plan's interest in both the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock at between zero
and $.53 per share. With respect to the value of the Secured Note I Fund, Ms. Mandelbaum indicates that there is little
likelihood of Notes issued by the Secured Note I Fund ever being paid. Accordingly, in the opinion of Ms. Mandelbaum
the Plan's interest in the Secured Note I Fund is assumed to be worthless. 
9. In summary, the applicant, represents that the proposed transactions meet the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: 
(a) The Plan will be able to invest the proceeds from such sales in more profitable assets; 
(b) The Plan will receive no less than fair market value of such Assets on the date of each sale and in the aggregate the
Plan will receive no less than $683,384 for the sale of all of the Assets to the Employer; 
(c) Each of the sales will be a one time transaction for cash; 
(d) The Plan will incur no costs, fees, commissions, or other expenses as a result of the sales of the Assets to the Employer;
and

(e) The proposed sales will avoid an in-kind distribution of an undivided interest in the Assets to the participants
and beneficiaries. 



Tax Consequences of Transaction 



The Department of the Treasury has determined that if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and
its sponsoring employer (or affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less than or receiving more than
fair market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan and therefore
must be examined under applicable provisions of the Code, including section 401(a)(4), 404, and 415.

(C) The interests of the Plan for all purposes under the Lease are represented by an independent fiduciary, Norwest

General Information
 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 

(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of class III gaming ordinances approved by the Chairman of the National
Indian Gaming Commission.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 

et seq

., was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 

Federal Register

, approved class III gaming ordinances



The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the 

Federal Register

 would be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a
notice of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St. NW., suite 250, Washington, DC 20036.

The Chairman has approved tribal gaming ordinances authorizing class III gaming for the following Indian tribes:




Ak-Chin Indian Community

Bois Forte Band of Chippewa Indians

Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Indian Reservation

Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians

Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community

Klawock Cooperative Association

Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians

Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians

Northern Cheyenne Tribe

Oneida Indian Nation of New York

Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indian

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Co. North Anna Power Station, Units 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No
Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-4 and NPF-7 issued to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the North Anna Power Station, Units 1 and 2 (NA-1&2) located in Louisa County, Virginia.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would revise the limitations on concentrations of radioactive material released in liquid effluents
and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in gaseous effluents, and reflect
the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the
new 10 CFR part 20. The review of an additional item, to revise the definition of ``UNRESTRICTED AREA'', was not completed
and consequently is not included in the amendment. It will be addressed by separate correspondence.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, Appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The proposed revision does not change the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS)
as a dose rate to the maximally exposed number of the public. Therefore, there will be no increase in the types or amounts
of effluents that may be released offsite, nor an increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures.
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated
with the proposed changes.

Wih regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
impacts associated with the proposed changes.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission's staff has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the
proposed changes to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This
would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in connection with the Final Environmental
Statement related to the operation of NA-1&2, dated April 1973.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the State of Virginia regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments.

Based on the above environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further information with respect to this action, see the application dated July 16, 1993, as supplemented November
15, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC and at the Alderman Library, Special Collections Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia
22903-2498. 




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 5th day of January 1994.





For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>







The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) for operation of the River Bend Station
located in St. Francisville, LA.

The proposed amendment would grant one-time extensions for certain technical specification (TS) surveillances
which are currently required to be performed beginning February 16, 1994. The licensee is requesting extension of
the surveillance intervals because the current operating cycle has been extended, impacting the required completion
dates for these surveillances. Performance of these surveillances within the required intervals would require
that the plant be placed in an undesirable operating configuration, or would necessitate a plant shutdown. The surveillances
for which extensions have been requested will be performed during the fifth refueling outage, scheduled to begin
on April 16, 1994.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The licensee's amendment request
dated December 8, 1993, contains a detailed list of the specific surveillances for which it is requesting extensions.
For the purposes of addressing the no significant hazards consideration determination, the staff has categorized
the surveillances by groups in the following discussion. The licensee's determination of no significant hazards
is summarized below:

1. The proposed change would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The first group of surveillances includes calibration, logic system functional testing (LSFT), and response time
testing of reactor protection system (RPS), isolation actuation system, and emergency core cooling system (ECCS)
instrumentation; and calibration of control rod block, remote shutdown and accident monitoring, and feedwater
system/main turbine trip system instrumentation. The licensee identified vendor and topical reports which support
longer surveillance intervals for certain instruments and elimination of surveillance tests from TS for other instruments.
The licensee also stated that observed drift characteristics, as well as the presence of redundant and diverse channels
for most of the affected instrumentation, support extension of these surveillance intervals. The affected surveillances
are associated with equipment that is also subject to channel checks and/or functional tests which will continue
to be performed during the extension period and should ensure that these systems will perform as designed. Based on
the above, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur
as a result of extending the surveillance intervals by the relatively short time periods requested.

The next group of surveillances concern demonstration of automatic isolation of reactor water cleanup (RWCU) system
containment isolation valves on receipt of an isolation test signal. Due to redundancy provided in the design of the
penetrations, periodic testing of the containment isolation system performed during power operation, and the short
period of time for which the interval extension is requested, no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending this surveillance interval.

The third group of surveillances concern inspection, service tests, and performance tests of dc batteries; and load
tests of the battery chargers. Due to the fact that the testing history for the batteries and chargers has been good,
the (nominally) weekly pilot cell data has indicated no degradation, and the short period of time the interval is being
extended, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur
as a result of extending these surveillance intervals.

<PARENT> FR940118-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The fourth group of surveillances concern calibration of RPS electrical protection assembles (EPAs). Based on the
inherent lack of drift of the EPAs and the accuracy of the system logic, no significant increase in the probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would occur as a result of extending these surveillance intervals.
The licensee also proposed reestablishment of the baseline for the ``N times 18 months'' cumulative surveillance
interval for response time testing by extending the cumulative surveillance interval to coincide with the individual
extensions discussed above. Extension of the cumulative interval would not be for more than the individual extensions
requested. Due to the fact that the individual extensions have been shown to present no significant increase in risk
as discussed above, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident
would occur as a result of extending the cumulative surveillance interval for response time testing.
2. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
The extension of the surveillance intervals will not result in any changes in plant configuration or operation. Therefore,
the extensions will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated or analyzed.
3. The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
For the reasons cited in Criterion 1 above, the proposed changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin
of safety.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By February 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Suzanne C. Black, Director, Project Directorate IV-2, Division of Reactor
Projects III/IV/V, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555: petitioner's name and telephone

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-86, issued to North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (the licensee), for operation of the
Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.
The proposed amendment would change the Seabrook Station, Unit 1 (Seabrook) Technical Specifications (TS) to permit
operation of the Seabrook core with an expanded axial flux difference (AFD) band from that currently permitted. Operation
with the expanded AFD band is supported by continuous monitoring of core power distribution using the fixed incore
detector system. Other TS changes allow for fuel design enhancements. The changes to the TS include modification
to a number of safety analysis input parameters and assumptions as follows:



 Incorporation of Westinghouse WRB-1 departure from nucleate boiling correlation and revised thermal
design procedure.
 Increased core power distribution peaking factors.
 Allowance for positive moderator temperature coefficient.
 Allowance for thimble plug deletion.
 Allowance for increased steam generator tube plugging limit.
 Allowance for new fuel design features.
 Modification of analytical assumptions related to certain surveillance parameters.
 Expansion of AFD band Limiting Condition for Operation.



The proposed amendment would affect TS Sections 3.1.1.3, 3.1.3.4, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.3.3.2, 4.2.1,
4.2.2, 4.2.5, 4.5.2, 5.3, and 6.8.1, Figure 2.1-1, and Tables 2.2-1, 3.3-4, and 4.3-1.
Before issuance of the proposed licensee amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

<DOCTITLE>License Termination for the Old Vic, Inc., Site in Cleveland, OH</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of license termination.




This notice is to inform the public that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is terminating
Byproduct Material License Number 31-26394-01 issued to Old Vic, Inc. (formerly Victoreen Incorporated)
in Cleveland, Ohio. Victoreen Incorporated (Victoreen) used radioactive materials, at its Woodland Avenue facility,
for conducting research, instrument calibration, and manufacturing of electronic components, from 1965 until
1987. Victoreen began decommissioning the facility in October 1988. To clarify ownership of the facility and the
responsibility for decommissioning, on March 30, 1992, the Commission issued a license to Old Vic, Inc., and terminated
Victoreen's license. The Old Vic, Inc., site on Woodland Avenue is listed on the Commission's Site Decommissioning
Management Plan. In November 1993, Old Vic, Inc., completed the decommissioning. Based on the remedial actions taken
by the licensee, the Commission's staff's review of the licensee's termination surveys, and the results of the Commission's
confirmatory surveys, the Commission concludes that decommissioning activities are complete and the site is suitable
for unrestricted use.

This termination will be reopened only if additional contamination, or noncompliance with the decommissioning
plan, is found indicating a significant threat to public health and safety. Noncompliance would occur if the licensee
had not complied with an approved decommissioning plan or had provided false information.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-59 issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee) for operation of the James
A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County, New York. 

The proposed amendment would add Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirements to Tables
3.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler Protected Areas'', and 4.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler System Tests'' and clarify
the associated Bases to reflect the installation of a new full area fire suppression system in the east and west cable
tunnels. This new full area fire suppression system was installed because the previous sprinkler system did not provide
coverage to some cable trays and the sprinkler head orientation did not provide full coverage of the cable trays where
it was installed. The proposed amendment would also correct other portions of Tables 3.12.1 and 4.12.1 for consistency
with changes made to reflect the east and west cable tunnel modification. 

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 


 


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed changes revise the Technical Specifications to incorporate a modification to the James A. FitzPatrick
Fire Protection System and to make existing Technical Specifications consistent with the specifications proposed
for the modification. The modification will improve the ability of the plant's fire protection system to detect and
suppress fires. The modified system has been designed, analyzed and constructed in accordance with fire protection
system requirements. These changes to the Technical Specifications assure that the modified system is operable
by periodic surveillance and that required actions are taken if it is not available. The surveillance requirements
meet or exceed past requirements. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 

The only potential for a new or different type of accident arises from different failure mechanisms of the system.
An analysis of flooding has demonstrated that there are no associated failures of shutdown equipment. The new system
has been designed and constructed so that there is no damage to safety related equipment due to missiles or water spray.
The modification to the first protection system provides additional protection for possible fires in the east and
west cable tunnels through increased spray coverage. There are no changes to plant operations or operating procedures
other than Surveillance Requirements. The Surveillance Requirements are consistent with past plant practices
and industry codes and standards. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

The piping has been designed and constructed to prevent damage to safety related equipment due to missiles or water
spray during a seismic event. The modification improves the plant's capability to detect and suppress fires. The
potential for flooding or water damage has been evaluated and does not result in failure of shutdown equipment. The
LCO and Surveillance Requirements meet or exceed past practice. This change results in no reduction in the margin
of safety. 


 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By February 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Penfield Library, State University College of New York, Oswego,
NY 13126. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Robert A. Capra: Petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Charles M. Pratt, Power Authority of the State of New York, 1633 Broadway, New York, NY
10019, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated December 22, 1993, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Penfield Library, State University College
of New York, Oswego, NY 13126.

<DOCTITLE>Requests Under Review by Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



Agency Clearance Officer_John J. Lane, (202) 942-8800.

Upon written request copies available from: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings, Information
and Consumer Services, Washington, DC 20549.






Proposed Rule: 

Rule 18f-3, File No. 270-385.



Proposed Amendments: 

Form N-1A, File No. 270-21, Form N-14, File No. 270-297, Rule 34b-1, File No. 270-305.




Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

.), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval, proposal of Rule
18f-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a) (the ``Investment Company Act''), Forms N-1A
and N-14 under the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a, 

et seq

.) (the ``Securities Act''), and proposed amendments to rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act.

Proposed rule 18f-3 would permit any registered open-end management investment company that satisfies its
conditions to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities but having
different arrangements for shareholder services, distribution, or both. Proposed rule 18f-3 would require
that a multiple class fund adopt a written plan setting forth the different class arrangements. The Commission estimates
that approximately 675 registered open-end, management investment companies would use proposed rule 18f-3
and that the annual reporting burden would be approximately one hour per respondent, for a total of about 675 burden
hours.

The Commission also is proposing amendments to Forms N-1A and N-14 and rule 34b-1 that would require
certain disclosure by multiple class funds and feeder funds in master-feeder structures about the classes or feeders
not offered in the prospectus, or sales literature. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end
management investment companies other than small business investment companies and insurance company separate
accounts. The average additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-1A is estimated to be .4
hours per registrant for a total of about 1,080 additional burden hours. Thus, the total annual burden for Form N-1A
per registrant would become 1059.96 hours per registrant and the total for all registrants would be 2,861,892 hours.

Form N-14 is the registration statement used by investment companies to register under the Securities Act securities
to be issued in mergers and other forms of business combination. By cross-referencing a number of items in Form N-1A,
Form N-14 requires disclosure of some of the same information regarding the management investment companies
involved in the transaction. Approximately 95 registrants filed Form N-14 in 1992, with an estimated compliance
time of 2,500 hours per registrant. The maximum additional burden imposed by the amendments is estimated to be .3 hours
per registrant for a total additional burden of 28.5 additional hours for all registrants. The total annual burden
for Form N-14 would be 2,500.3 hours per registrant and 237,528.5 hours for all registrants.

Rule 34b-1 governs the use of performance information in investment company sales literature. In 1992, approximately
287 respondents used performance data in their sales literature and rule 34b-1 imposed a total annual burden
of 3,444 hours on those respondents. The proposed amendment to rule 34b-1 would impose an average additional
burden of .3 hours per response on those 287 respondents, each of which makes approximately five responses per year,
for a total additional annual burden of 430.5 hours. Thus, the total annual burden imposed by rule 34b-1 would
become 3,874.5 hours.

In total, proposed rule 18f-3, and the proposed amendments to Forms N-1A and N-14 would impose an
additional total burden on all respondents of 2,214 hours. The estimated average burden hours are made solely for
the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are not derived from a comprehensive or even a representative study
of the costs of Commission rules and forms.

Direct general comments to Gary Waxman at the address below. Direct any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated
average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules and forms to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer,
Office of Management and Budget.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Various Rule Revisions </DOCTITLE>



January 10, 1994. 



I. Introduction 



On February 28, 1992, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'' or ``Exchange Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend various exchange rules. On May 4, 1992, the Amex submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the
proposal.
 On June 2, 1992, the Amex submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposal.
 On June 25, 1993, the Amex submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 3 to the proposal.
 









Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 9, 1993.
 No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule changes. 





II. Discussion and Findings 



The Exchange conducted a review of its rules and determined that certain revisions were necessary to conform the Amex
rules to recent changes to comparable NYSE rules or to update certain rules which contain provisions which are no longer
applicable or which fail to address current concerns.

The Commission has carefully reviewed the Amex's proposed rule changes and concludes that the proposed changes are
consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities
exchange and, in particular, with sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8), 11(b), and 11A(a)(1) of the Act.
 The Commission supports the Amex's efforts to continue to review the form and substance of market trading regulation
in response to changes in market structure. The Commission believes that it is important to market quality that the
Exchange have a regulatory program that is tailored to the current market structure. The Commission believes that
the proposed rule changes will be helpful in updating the Amex market structure and trading rules and will further
the purposes of the Act.
 The Commission's detailed discussion regarding the significant changes proposed by the Amex follows.






The Amex proposes to amend several rules so that they correctly identify exchange procedures or facilities. The Commission
believes that these rule changes are appropriate and logical revisions to the Amex Rules.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940118-2-00100 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940118-2-00060 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Amex proposes to amend other rules so that such rules either conform to similar NYSE Rules, are made clear, or are
responsive to current market conditions. The Commission believes that these rule changes are also appropriate and
logical revisions to Amex Rules. These rule changes are discussed below. 

Rule 103(a)_Dealings When Option Granted or Held: Rule 103(a) prohibits a member, while on the floor, from buying
or selling any stock if the member or his firm holds or has granted an option to buy or sell the stock. This rule was adopted
prior to 1961. In December 1985, Exchange Act Rule 175 was revised to permit a stock specialist to hedge his stock position
with options.
 The Exchange asserts that Rule 103(a) should, therefore, similarly be revised to permit a stock specialist to engage
in listed options transactions to hedge his stock position. 





The Commission believes that this rule change is appropriate in order to ensure uniformity among Amex Rules and in
order to conform Amex Rules to Exchange Act Rule 175. This change will serve to facilitate transactions pursuant to
section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
 





Rule 103(c)_Discretionary Transactions: This rule provision prohibits the regular or options principal member,
while on the floor, from executing or causing to be executed on the Exchange
 any transaction for the purchase or sale of any security with respect to which transaction such member is vested with
discretion as to the choice of a security to be bought or sold, the total amount of any security to be bought or sold, or
whether any such transaction shall be one of purchase or sale. The prohibition applies except when the member is executing
a transaction for a bona fide cash investment account or for the account of a person who due to illness, absence, etc.,
is unable to effect transactions for his own account. It is proposed that the exceptions be deleted since they are not
appropriate in today's market. The NYSE has adopted a similar revision to a comparable rule.
 






The Commission agrees that the proposed amendment to Rule 103(c) is substantially similar to recent revisions to
NYSE Rule 95 and therefore should be approved. In the Commission's order approving the NYSE's amendments to Rule 95,
we stated that the deletion of the exceptions would strengthen the rule by further limiting the authority of members
to execute discretionary orders.
 This change will help to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in accordance with section 6(b)(5)
of the Act.
 






Rule 108_Priority and Parity at Openings: Paragraph (c) discusses parity at openings of limit orders in the crowd
with orders on the specialist's book. The Exchange states that because Exchange Act Rule 11a1-1 impacts on the
types of orders which may be on parity, Rule 108(c) should include a reference to it.

The Commission agrees that it is appropriate for Rule 108 to include a reference to Exchange Act Rule 11a1-1 since
it specifically deals with transactions yielding priority, parity, and precedence. This change is designed to promote
just and equitable principles of trade pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act
 as it will serve to clarify Rule 108.




Rules 110 and 111_Registered Traders and Restrictions on Registered Traders: These rules, which provide that only
members registered as traders may trade for their own accounts while on the Trading Floor, were adopted in 1964 to restrict
on-floor transactions by floor members, who, it was believed, had trading advantages due to their presence on the
trading floor when market news unfolded, and due to their ability to quickly react to such information. The Exchange
believes that since current communications technology makes information readily available to off-floor market
participants, there is no reason to continue to so restrict members' on-floor orders.

<TEXT>
 

The Amex propose to rescind the current Rule 111, Commentary .03 and adopt a new Commentary .03 (a) through (d).
 Such new commentary will permit members, while on the trading floor, to enter orders for their own accounts provided
that such orders are entered through an on-floor communications facility and sent to an off-floor clearing firm's
order room where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained before the order is retransmitted to the trading
floor. 






Proposed Commentary .03(a) generally provides that a member using a communication facility on the floor of the Exchange
to enter an order for his own account shall be deemed to be initiating an off-floor order if such order is routed through
a clearing firm's order room, where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained, before such order is re-transmitted
to the floor for execution. 

Proposed Commentary .03(b) generally provides that any order entered by a member for any account in which it (or its
officer, allied member or employee) is directly or indirectly interested, or for any discretionary account serviced
by the member organization, following a conversation with the member or employee in that organization who is on the
floor, shall be deemed to be an off-floor order, provided that such order is transmitted to the floor through an order
room or other facility regularly used for the transmission of public orders to the floor; where a time-stamped record
of the order is maintained; or an exception is available in Rule 111 (f), (g), or (h). 

The Commission believes that proposed Commentary .03 (a) and (b) to Rule 111 (Restrictions on Registered Traders)
are substantially similar to those made to NYSE Rule 112.10 (Orders Initiated ``Off the Floor'') and those made to
NYSE Rule 112.20 (``On the Floor'' and ``Off the Floor''); therefore the rationale for approval of both sets of rules
is substantially the same. The Commission finds that the rules dealing with on-floor orders provide a practical means
for a member on the floor to enter an order for his own account without having to physically leave the floor, as is currently
necessary. The Commission further finds that the amendments to Rule 111, Commentary .03 (a) and (b) more accurately
reflect the status of on and off-floor orders. The Commission believes that the requirement of routing on-floor orders
upstairs and then back down to the floor will continue to prevent any undue advantage of floor immediacy from accruing
to orders designated as off-floor.







Proposed Commentary .03(c) generally provides that no member shall execute or cause to be executed, on the Exchange,
any order for any account in which such member, member organization, or any member, allied member, or approved person
in such organization or officer or employee thereof, is interested or for any discretionary account serviced by the
member, in contravention of any Exchange policy against frontrunning of transactions that the Exchange may from
time to time adopt and make known to its members. 

The Commission believes that, like the similar NYSE Rule (112.20(d)), proposed Commentary .03(c) to Rule 111 promotes
conduct consistent with just and equitable principles of trade, in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, by
explicitly incorporating the frontrunning policy into rules governing competitive trader conduct. 

Proposed Commentary .03(d) generally provides that members who are not regular members (as described in Article
IV of the Exchange Constitution) may enter orders in accordance with the Commentary .03 only in securities which members
of their class are otherwise entitled to trade while on the floor of the Exchange. 

The Commission believes that Commentary .03(d) (along with Rule 950(c)) is appropriate in order to ensure that members
other than registered traders, such as limited trading option permit holders, may enter orders for their accounts
while on the floor.

Rule 110_Registered Traders: In addition to the changes made to Rule 111, the Exchange also proposes to amend Rule
110 to add a reference to Rule 111. As amended, Rule 110 would provide that members may not initiate a transaction while
on the floor for an account in which they have an interest unless the member is registered as a registered trader with
the Exchange, except as provided in Rule 111, Commentary .03. The Commission believes that this revision permits
Rule 110 to maintain its proper relationship with Rule 111 as revised. The NYSE has adopted similar revisions to its
comparable rules.






The Commission believes that the changes to Rule 110 are appropriate unifying changes in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade which generally serve to protect investors and
the public interest pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






Rule 115_Exchange Procedures for Use of Unusual Market Exception: The Exchange proposes to add a new Commentary to
Rule 115. This Rule contains exceptions to Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1-1, but currently there is no reference in
Rule 115 to the requirements of Rule 11Ac1-1. The Exchange therefore proposes that Commentary .02 be added to
Rule 115 to incorporate the text of Rule 11Ac1-1, as has been done by the NYSE in its Rule 60.






The Commission agrees that it is appropriate for Rule 115 to incorporate the text of Rule 11Ac1-1 in order to create
a more thorough Rule, thereby providing the members with clearer guidance. This change will promote just and equitable
principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






Rule 124(b)_Types of Bids and Offers: In discussing ``next day'' delivery of rights and warrants, the rule indicates
that ``bids and offers in rights and warrants shall specify `next day' in accordance with Rule 17.'' The Exchange proposes
that Rule 124 be revised to clarify that the reference in Rule 17 relates only to expiring rights and warrants.

The Commission believes that the addition of the word ``expiring'' to Rule 124(b) is appropriate to clarify that the
next day provisions discussed therein only refer to expiring rights and warrants. This change will, therefore, promote
just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






Rule 126(e)3_Precedence of Bids and Offers_Sale Removes All Bids: Paragraph 3 generally provides, with one exception,
that a sale removes all bids from the floor.
 The Exchange proposes to amend paragraph 3 of Rule 126(e) to add a provision stating that the aforementioned applies
only when not in contravention of Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1-1.





The Commission believes that the aforementioned change to Rule 126(e)3 is an appropriate clarifying change to the
Rule.

Rule 126(h)_Precedence of Bids and Offers_Disputes: Rule 126(h) provides that, unless resolved by the members involved,
disputes shall be settled, if practicable, by a vote of witnesses to a trade, and if not so settled shall be settled by
a Floor Official.
 It is proposed that the rule be revised (and redesignated 126(i) due to a change in another rule filing) to provide that
disputes will be settled by a Floor Official who may, in his deliberations, consider the comments of witnesses, and
where only the amount traded was in dispute, the size of the order held by those involved in the dispute. The NYSE has
adopted a similar revision to its comparable rule.

The Commission believes that, like the changes to NYSE Rule 75, the changes to Rule 126(i) appropriately increase
the level of oversight brought to the resolution of trade disputes by removing the membership voting procedures and
replacing them with specified factors for Floor Official consideration. This increased oversight will thus promote
just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






Rule 131(a)_Types of Orders_Market Orders: Rule 131(a) provides that a market order to buy or sell a stated amount
of a security at the most advantageous price obtainable after the order is represented in the trading crowd. Rule 131(a)
further provides that the responsibilities of brokers handling market, limited price, at the close, and not held
orders are set forth in Rule 156. It is proposed that ``switch orders'' be included in the reference to the orders brokers
handle. This revision follows the inclusion of such orders in Rule 156. 

The Commission believes that the addition of switch orders is appropriate as such orders are being added to Rule 156.


Rule 131(f)_Types of Orders_At the Opening Order: It is proposed that the phrase ``at the opening of the stock'' be
revised to clarify that an ``at the opening order'' is to be executed ``on the opening trade in the stock.'' This revision
incorporates into the rule a policy that is currently in effect on the Exchange. 

The Commission believes that because the proposed amendment would clarify the definition of an at-the-opening order,
it should be approved. The Commission agrees with the Exchange that the clarifications to the definition of ``at-the-opening-only''
orders should help remove any misconceptions about when such orders are eligible for execution. Accordingly, the
proposed rule change clarifies that while an ``at-the-opening-only'' order is eligible to be executed only on an
opening trade, such an order is not cancelled if the stock opens with a quotation rather than a trade. In addition, the
NYSE has revised its comparable rule in the same manner.






Rule 131(h)_Do not reduce orders (``DNR''): Rule 131(h) relates to DNR orders, which are not reduced to reflect ordinary
cash dividends but are reduced for other distributions such as when a stock goes ``ex'' a stock dividend or ex rights.
Currently, the rule defines DNR orders to include a limited order to buy, or a stop limit order to sell a round lot or odd
lot or a stop order to sell an odd lot which is not to be reduced by the amount of an ordinary cash dividend on the ex-dividend
date. The rule further provides that a DNR order applies only to ordinary cash dividends; it should be reduced for other
distributions such as when a stock goes ``ex'' a stock dividend or ex rights. The proposed change would add ``a stop
order to sell'' to the list of DNR orders. The Exchange would also add ``a special cash dividend'' to the list which provides
when a DNR order should be reduced for other distributions.






The Amex states that in 1987, the Exchange changed Rule 154 to permit specialists to accept stop orders on round lots
 and therefore, it proposed to modify Rule 131(h) to include stop orders to sell round-lots.
 The Exchange would also like to add special cash dividends to the list providing when a DNR order should be reduced for
other distributions because such dividends are unexpected and will not have otherwise been taken into account. 






The Commission believes that the changes to Rule 131(h) bring this rule into conformance with other Amex Rules and
lead to a correct definition of DNR orders in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The changes promote just and equitable
principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 

Rule 131(i)_Types of Orders_Fill or Kill: The definition of a ``fill or kill'' order in this paragraph includes a reference
to two other types of orders, ``immediate or cancel'' and ``all or none.'' The Exchange believes that these references
incorrectly suggest that such orders are comparable in nature when these three types of orders have unique characteristics.
For instance, a ``fill or kill'' order is to be executed in its entirety on presentation in the crowd or immediately
cancelled. ``Immediate or cancel'' orders require an immediate execution of all or part of the order with the balance
cancelled. The ``all or none'' order is to be executed in its entirety in one transaction but is not cancelled if not
executed immediately on presentation in the crowd. It is therefore proposed that the reference to ``immediate or
cancel'' and ``all or none'' orders be deleted, because this paragraph of the rule is not applicable to those types
of orders.

The Commission believes that, because this amendment appropriately clarifies the definition of a fill or kill order,
the amendment should be approved. This change will promote just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with
section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






Rule 131(l)_Types of Orders_Not Held Order: Currently, Rule 131(l) defines a not held order as a market or limited
price order marked ``not held,'' ``disregard tape,'' ``take time,'' or which bears any such qualifying notation.
The Exchange proposes that orders marked ``buy on the print'' or ``sell on the print'' be included in the types of orders
deemed to be ``not held orders'' because by their terms, these orders can only be executed if a print takes place at its
limit. The Exchange further asserts that as with other ``not held'' orders, there are no assurances that the broker
handling the order will be able to execute the order at that same price.

The Commission believes that ``buy or sell on print'' orders are appropriately classified as ``not held'' orders
because brokers cannot guarantee execution at the designated ``print' price. Classifying such orders as ``not held''
orders should serve to put customers on notice that they bear the price risk of an execution at a price other than the
``print'' price. The Commission approved a similar revision to the comparable NYSE Rule.
 The Commission believes that these changes will serve to protect investors and the public interest in accordance
with section 6(b)(5) of the Act
 by clarifying the definition of ``not held'' orders.






Rule 135_Cancellations: Currently, Rule 135 only permits a member or member organization to cancel a transaction
if it was made in error or for other proper reason, and unless in each case prior approval of the cancellation is obtained
from a Floor Official. The Exchange states that this permits unilateral cancellations. The Exchange proposes that
Rule 135 be revised to provide that a member may only cancel or revise a transaction if it was made in error or the cancellation
or revision is for other proper reason, and unless both the buying and selling members agree to the cancellation or
revision, and prior approval of the cancellation or revision is obtained from a Floor Official. The Exchange also
proposes that the title of the rule be revised to indicate that the rule relates to revisions in, as well as cancellations
of, transactions.

The Exchange further proposes to amend Commentary .02 to Rule 135 to require that when a transaction is not cancelled
but the member intends to assume for his or her own account the contract made for a customer, the provisions of Rule 390
apply, and any required consent of the Exchange under that rule is to be obtained from the Compliance and Surveillance
Division instead of through the Membership Compliance Division.

The Commission believes that the proposal should be approved because it will increase oversight of cancellations
or revisions as well as prevent unilateral cancellations. The proposal is modeled after the comparable NYSE Rule
(NYSE Rule 128B.10_Publication on the tape or in the sales sheet) which requires the cancellation of a transaction
to be agreed to by both sides of the transaction in question in addition to obtaining the approval of a Floor Official.
In addition, the change in designation in Commentary .02 to the Compliance and Surveillance Division is necessary
so that this rule identifies the appropriate Division governing the regulated conduct.

Rule 154, Commentary .03_Orders Left With Specialist: Commentary .03 provides that specialists may not accept ``not
held'' orders or orders with such qualifications as ``keep the best bid or offer,'' ``disregard tape,'' ``take time,''
and scale orders without specific amounts and prices orders. The Exchange proposes that Commentary .03 be revised
to include ``buy on the print'' and ``sell on the print'' as additional types of orders which a specialist is prohibited
from accepting because under Rule 131, a ``buy on the print'' or ``sell on the print'' order is deemed to be a ``not held''
order.

The Commission believes that this change is an appropriate ``housekeeping'' amendment that should be approved in
conjunction with approval of the proposed amendment to Rule 131.

Rule 154, Commentaries .06 and .07_Orders Left With Specialist: Current Commentary .06 provides that all good `til
cancelled (``G.T.C.'') orders on a specialist's book must be cancelled on such periodic dates as may be prescribed
by the Exchange, unless properly confirmed or renewed as prescribed by the Exchange. The Amex proposes to delete current
Commentary .06. Current Commentary .07 requires specialists to return receipt stubs of G.T.C. orders, cancellations
and confirmations on the same day in which they are received and it requires specialists to return receipt stubs of
periodic confirmations of renewals promptly as prescribed by the Exchange. Current Commentary .07 also requires
confirmations of cancellations of orders and confirmations or renewals of G.T.C. orders to be dated, and duplicate
receipt stubs to be maintained by specialists. The Exchange proposes to delete references to the return of receipt
stubs of periodic confirmation or renewals in Commentary .07 which will be renumbered as .06.
 The Exchange also proposes to delete the requirement that receipt stubs be signed by the specialists. In accordance
with the amendment, specialists will just have to stamp their name on such receipts. Finally, the Exchange proposes
to delete the requirements that confirmations or renewals of G.T.C. orders be dated and duplicate receipt stubs kept
for them. The Exchange states that these proposed changes are based upon the NYSE's recision of its Rule 123A.55 which
had required the periodic confirmation of G.T.C. orders on the specialist's book.
 The Exchange also states that these provisions are unnecessary in view of the automated recordkeeping ability of
member firms.

The Commission agrees that the changes to Rule 154, Commentary .06 and .07 should be enacted in order to update and streamline
order handling provisions and to bring the Amex Rules into line with automated exchange systems. These changes are
in accordance with section 11A(a)(1) of the Act which provides that new data processing and communications techniques
create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market operations. The changes to Commentary .06 and .07
will also promote equitable principles of trade and serve the public good in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the
Act
 by helping to create a more efficient marketplace.





Rule 154, Commentary .14_Orders Left With Specialist: Commentary .14 provides that a stop limit order to sell a round
lot or odd lot, which has been elected but not executed before the ex-dividend date is treated the same as an open limited
price order to sell and such orders are not to be reduced by the specialist or odd-lot dealer on ex-date unless otherwise
instructed. The Exchange states that such commentary is valid as it applies to cash dividends, but is inappropriate
where other than cash dividends are involved. The Exchange also states that such orders, pursuant to Rule 132 (price
adjustment of open orders on ``ex-date''), are to be adjusted as are all other orders to reflect stock dividends or
stock distributions. The Amex, therefore, proposes to amend this commentary to state that such orders are not to be
reduced by the specialist or odd-lot dealer for a cash dividend but will be adjusted for stock dividends and stock distributions
on ex-date in accordance with Rule 132 unless otherwise instructed.

The Commission believes that this amendment is a logical ``housekeeping'' amendment which should be approved as
it promotes just and equitable principles of trade pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

Rule 155_Precedence Accorded to Orders Entrusted to Specialists: This rule requires that a specialist give precedence
to orders entrusted to him as an agent in any stock in which he is registered before executing at the same price any purchase
or sale in the same stock for an account in which the specialist has an interest. The Exchange states that since Exchange
Act Rule 11a1-1 became effective, the aforementioned requirement is not universal and therefore several exemptions
apply. The specialist is not required to refrain from trading for his own account when in possession of inexecutable
``G'' orders. Also, the Rule 155 requirements do not apply to on-floor orders subject to the ``two-tick'' restriction
and unelected percentage orders. The Amex proposes that this rule be amended to state that the general requirement
that a specialist yield precedence under Rule 155 does not apply in these three situations.

The Commission believes that the amendment to Rule 155 should be approved because it will conform Exchange Rules to
Exchange Act Rule 11a1-1 and clarify the application of Rule 155, thereby promoting just and equitable principles
of trade pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






Rule 156_Representation of Orders: Currently, Rule 156 sets forth a broker's responsibility for the handling of
``market,'' ``limited price,'' ``at the close'' and ``not held'' orders. The Amex proposes that this rule be amended
(by adding paragraph (e)) to include a broker's responsibility for the handling of ``switch orders'' and to provide
that a broker may handle a ``switch order'' on a ``best efforts'' basis. The Exchange states that this proposal recognizes
the difficulties a member may encounter in executing this type of order since it requires the execution of orders in
different securities at the same time at a designated price difference.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that this amendment to Rule 156 should be approved because ``switch orders'' are appropriately
defined under the category of ``representation of orders,'' and because allowing ``switch orders'' to be handled
on a ``best efforts'' basis reflects current market realities, thereby helping to ensure efficient execution of
securities transactions pursuant to section 11A(a)(1) of the Act. The NYSE has similarly revised its comparable
rule.






Rule 950(c)_Floor Rules Applicable to Options_Rules of General Applicability: This paragraph provides that, with
certain exceptions, the restrictions on Registered Traders as imposed by Rule 111 will apply to the trading of options.
The Amex proposes to extend the proposed amendment to Rule 111, to permit members while on the Floor to enter orders
in a manner that permits them to be deemed ``off-Floor'' orders, to options trading. The Exchange states that because
it has determined that there is no reason why the proposed revisions to Rule 111 should not be applicable to transactions
in non-equity securities as well as equity securities, the Exchange proposes to revise Rule 950(c) accordingly.






The Commission agrees that there is no reason to distinguish between options and equities with respect to ``off-floor''
orders. And, this equal treatment of equities and options will promote just and equitable principles of trade in accordance
with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.





Rule 950(e)_Floor Rules Applicable to Options_Rules of General Applicability: This provision sets forth the types
of orders, in addition to the orders in Rule 131, that apply to options transactions. The Amex proposes to add a commentary
to Rule 950(e) to clarify that ``at the opening'' orders in options are executable in whole or in part at the opening
rotation in the pertinent option and that any such order or the portion thereof not so executed is to be treated as cancelled.
The Commission believes that the addition of Commentary .01 to Rule 950(e) is appropriate as it will clarify the manner
in which ``at the opening'' orders in options are executable. This change will therefore serve to promote just and
equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.





Rule 950(h), Commentary .05_Floor Rules Applicable to Options_Rules of General Applicability: Paragraph (h) of
Rule 950 makes the specialist financial requirements contained in Rule 171 applicable to options trading. Commentary
.05 to Rule 950(h), which details how the financial requirements are computed for options specialists, requires
an option specialist to maintain twenty option contracts for each class of options in which he or she is registered.
Rule 171, however, was revised several years ago to require specialists to ``maintain a cash or liquid asset position
in the amount of $600,000 or an amount sufficient to assume a position of sixty trading units of each security in which
such specialist is registered * * *.''
 That rule previously required specialists to assume a position of twenty trading units. The Exchange states that,
because Rule 171 now refers to sixty rather than twenty trading units, Commentary .05 should be amended accordingly.
The Amex, therefore, proposes to amend Commentary .05 to require that a specialist maintain sixty options contracts
of each class of options in which he or she is registered.







The Commission believes that the change to Rule 950(h) is necessary in order to conform this rule with previous changes
to Rule 171 thereby promoting just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.





Rule 959_Accommodation Transactions. This rule provides a ``cabinet'' trading facility for the trading of options
which are out of the money to the extent that there is no buying interest at the minimum price at which options trade (1/16
of $1 or $.06-1/2 per underlying share). Orders to sell at $1 per contract ($.01 per underlying share) may be entered
in the cabinet subject to a number of restrictions, including the requirement that only closing orders may be entered
in the ``cabinet.'' Because the rule applies only to orders left in the ``cabinet,'' opening orders may be crossed
in the crowd. The Rule, however, does not provide for this type of transaction. The Amex therefore, proposes that the
rule be amended to provide that opening or closing purchase and sell orders may be executed in the crowd in the absence
of closing purchase or sale orders in the cabinet.
The Commission believe that this is an appropriate clarifying amendment to Rule 959.


III. Conclusion



The Commission has reviewed carefully the Exchange's proposed rule changes and concludes that, for the above stated
reasons, the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable
to a national securities exchange. The Commission believes that the proposals developed by the Exchange appropriately
balance the competing concerns of various Exchange constituencies in a manner consistent with just and equitable
principles of trade. Given the dynamic nature of competitive forces shaping the national market system, the Commission
strongly supports the Amex's efforts to review and update the structure of market trading regulation in order to maintain
an efficient and meaningful regulatory program.

Accordingly, based upon the aforementioned factors, the Commission finds that the Exchange's proposed rule change
updating its market regulation rules is consistent with sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8), 11(b), and 11A(a)(1) of the Act
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.




It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-92-10) be, and hereby is, approved.

General Public Utilities Corporation, et al. (70-8315)


General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered
holding company, and its wholly owned non-utility subsidiary company, Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII'') (collectively,
``Applicants''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07074, have filed an application-declaration under
sections 6, 7, 9, 10, 12(b), and 32 of the Act and Rules 45 and 53 thereunder.
The Commission issued a notice of the filing on January 7, 1994 (HCAR No. 25971) (``January 7th Notice''). In the January
7th notice, EII proposed to acquire a limited partnership interest for $11.5 million in a Canadian limited partnership
(``Partnership'') being formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 22.5 megawatt wood and oil fired cogeneration
facility in Brooklyn, Nova Scotia, Canada (``Project''). Applicants anticipated that the Project would quality
as an exempt wholesale generator as defined by section 32(a)(1) of the Act. EII proposed to secure its equity contribution
to the Partnership through an irrevocable letter of credit for $11.5 million with GPU unconditionally guaranteeing
EII's obligations. Alternatively, should the Partnership elect to borrow $11.5 million from lending institutions
to provide a portion of the construction financing, GPU proposed to guarantee unconditionally EII's repayment obligations.

Applicants now propose that GPU make a capital contribution to EII of up to $11.5 million. EII proposes to use such funds
to acquire its interest in the Partnership.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Debt Management Advisory Committee; Meeting </DOCTITLE>

 

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury Department,
15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, on February 1 and 2, 1994, of the following debt management advisory
committee:



 
Public Securities Association 

 Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee



 
The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on February 1, followed
by a charge by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working
session. On February 2, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations. 

 The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on February 1 and will be open to the
public. The remaining sessions on February 1 and the committee's reporting session on February 2 will be closed to
the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(d). 

 This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. 10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101-05, that the closed portions of the meeting are
concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest requires
that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice from representatives
of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations. Historically, this
advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major segments of the financial
community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee under 5 U.S.C. App. 3. 

 Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption
covered by 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A). 

 The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management
advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and
such other matters as may be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. 552b.

 Notice of Availability and Request for Comment on Sediment Quality Criteria and Support Documents. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed,
and is requesting public comments on, documents presenting proposed Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection
of Benthic Organisms for five priority pollutant (section 307(a)) chemicals, guidelines for deriving these criteria
on a site-specific basis, and the technical basis for deriving the criteria. The criteria documents present data
and criteria for acenaphthene, dieldrin, endrin, fluoranthene and phenanthrene, which were selected for their
known toxicity, hydrophobicity, and persistence. EPA intends to publish each of the documents in final form after
considering public comments, while the general regulatory role Sediment Quality Criteria play will be outlined
in the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy (CSMS) which will be available for public comment in the near future.
The Agency is specifically soliciting comments on the scientific soundness of the criteria development methodology
and the criteria themselves as opposed to their application. Comments received in response to this notice on the intended
uses and implementation of the criteria will be taken into account in preparing the proposed CSMS and other guidance
materials. An exception to this is the potential for the Sediment Quality Criteria to be used as Applicable and Relevant
or Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) under CERCLA. The EPA particularly welcomes comment and discussion on the applicability
and appropriateness of using the criteria as ARARs.

II. Background Information



Toxic contaminants in bottom sediments of the nation's lakes, rivers, wetlands, and coastal waters create the potential
for continued environmental impact even where water column contaminant levels comply with established water quality
criteria. In addition, contaminated sediments can have impacts on water quality even when additional pollutants
are no longer being added by any other source. It is intended that sediment quality criteria be protective of benthic
organisms and be used to: assess the extent of sediment contamination, aid in implementing measures that limit or
prevent additional contamination, and identify when appropriate remediation activities are needed.

Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting
the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic
life, wildlife and recreation. EPA has periodically issued ambinent water quality criteria guidance, beginning
with the publication of ``Water Quality Criteria 1972.'' All criteria guidance through late 1986 was summarized
in an EPA document entitled ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986.'' EPA has subsequently published, from time to time,
new ambient water quality criteria guidance for additional pollutants or revised existing criteria guidance.

EPA's criteria documents are intended to provide a comprehensive toxicological evaluation of each chemical addressed
therein, based on available information. For toxic pollutants, the documents tabulate the numeric acute and chronic
toxicity information for aquatic life and, where sufficient information is available, derive the numeric criteria
maximum concentrations (acute criteria) and the numeric criteria continuous concentrations (chronic criteria)
that the Agency recommends to protect aquatic life resources. The documents also provide recommended criteria to
protect human health. EPA has published numeric aquatic life criteria for 30 priority pollutants and human health
criteria for 91 priority pollutants. Aquatic life criteria address potential water column impacts only. 

EPA is now proposing sediment quality criteria for five priority pollutant chemicals (endrin, dieldrin, fluoranthene,
phenanthrene, and acenaphthene) that EPA has determined are present in the sediment of the Nation's waters and cause
or have the potential to cause adverse effects to the water column and benthic assemblages and their hierarchical
foodchains including humans. Pursuant to section 104 of the Clean Water Act, the Agency has conducted research, experiments
and demonstrations and has studied the effects of contaminated sediment on freshwater, marine, and estuarine aquatic
life. EPA used this information to develop the criteria proposed today, which represent EPA's first effort to develop
sediment quality criteria. These five chemicals were selected because of their known toxicity, hydrophobicity,
and persistence. 

EPA developed these proposed sediment quality criteria using a methodology called the Equilibrium Partitioning
Approach which was selected after considering a variety of approaches that could be used to assess sediment contamination.
Technical reviews of the methodology and supporting science was conducted by the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB)
in February 1989 and June 1992. Data collected in support of the ambient aquatic life water quality criteria or an equivalent
data base were also used to derive the proposed sediment quality criteria. Sediment criteria concentrations are
expressed as micrograms chemical per gram organic carbon and apply to sediments with " 0.2% organic carbon; below
this the criteria should not be applied because of significant scientific uncertainty associated with extrapolating
to sediments with < 0.2% organic carbon. 



III. Possible Uses of Sediment Quality Criteria 



The main purpose of this notice is to seek comment on the scientific and technical merit of the criteria and methodology.
To place the criteria in context, this section discusses potential uses of the criteria. 

EPA is in the process of identifying and evaluating a range of possible uses to which final sediment quality criteria
may be applied. For example, EPA is considering whether to use these criteria as a basis for water quality assessment
reports under section 305(b), as a basis for total maximum daily loads under section 303(d), and water quality-based
effluent limits in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (``NPDES'') permits under section 402, and/or
as a possible standard in developing clean-up strategies under the Clean Water Act or other statutes. These and other
possible uses are discussed below.

Section 305(b) requires the states to assess the quality of their navigable waters in terms of the extent to which they
meet the goals of the Clean Water Act. EPA proposes to encourage states, during these assessments, to identify areas
with sediment contamination.

Under section 303(c), states adopt water quality standards including criteria to protect designated uses. Final
section 304(a) numeric sediment quality criteria guidance could be used by states in adopting State numeric sediment
quality criteria designed to protect the public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water, and serve the purposes
of the Act. 

Sediment quality criteria could become a basis for total maximum daily loads under section 303(d) and water quality-based
effluent limits in NPDES permits under section 402. (Their use in NPDES permits is discussed in detail below). Pursuant
to section 303(d), states are required to identify and establish total maximum daily loads for water where existing
pollution controls are not stringent enough to achieve applicable water quality standards. Under section 301(b)(1)(c),
permit writers are required to impose in NPDES permits any more stringent limitations necessary to achieve water
quality standards. If a state has adopted water quality standards based on sediment quality criteria, and if those
standards are not being achieved, then TMDLs are required (unless existing controls will remedy the impairment)
and appropriate effluent limits need to be included in NPDES permits. In addition, even if the states do not adopt numeric
sediment criteria as part of state water quality standards, the EPA section 304(a) criteria could still be used by
State and Federal permit writers as a starting point under 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)(vi) to derive numeric water quality-based
effluent limits as necessary to attain applicable narrative criteria (e.g., those that require receiving waters
to be ``free from'' toxics). Indeed, many states, as part of their narrative criteria, have adopted prohibitions
against objectionable sediment deposits. Similarly, the section 304(a) criteria could be used in state's TMDLs.

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program


In EPA's 1987 report, An Overview of Sediment Quality in the United States, municipal sewage treatment plants and
combined sewer overflows were cited as sources of sediment contamination in all regions of the country. Chemical,
steel, metal working and electroplating industries were also mentioned as sources in many areas as were engine and
automotive facilities, nuclear energy producers, paper mills, tanneries, refineries and other petroleum industries,
electrical component and capacitor manufacturers, and wood preservers. The Agency is compiling a national inventory
of point and nonpoint sources of sediment contamination to assist in targeting at risk sites and facilities. 
In recognition of the role of contaminated sediments as a cause of impaired water quality, the NPDES permitting program
is developing and field testing models predictive of the ambient quality of water and sediment. While existing water
quality models may be quite helpful in understanding the sediment dynamics in specific waterbodies, they may be too
complex to be routinely used by regulatory authorities to establish water quality-based effluent limits based on
sediment quality criteria. The NPDES program is supporting development of a chemical-specific sediment quality
criteria-based effluent limit methdology and is testing its application. The NPDES program also intends to develop
guidance on the procedure. EPA hopes that such a method will be sufficiently sophisticated to be reliable and defensible,
yet require minimal data points and scientific extrapolations so that it can be routinely applied in a regulatory
context. 
In addition to developing a sediment quality criteria-based permitting methodology, the NPDES program is supporting
laboratory training, demonstrations, and guidance development on the assessment and control of bioconcentrating
pollutants which, by nature, accumulate in sediments. It is also supporting development of acute and chronic sediment
toxicity tests and sediment toxicity identification evaluations. The sediment quality criteria will advance all
of these efforts by establishing a new tool for achieving the long-term goals of the Act. 


Great Lakes Program 


Sediment quality criteria could also be used in connection with the Great Lakes program. For example, the Great Lakes
Water Quality Agreement provides that the United States and Canadian governments will cooperate with State and Provincial
governments to ensure that Remedial Action Plans (``RAPs'') are developed and implemented for specific Areas of
Concern (``AOCs'') in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Water Agreement also calls for the establishment of compatible
criteria between the two countries for the classification of sediment quality. Thus, EPA anticipates that Great
Lake States and EPA Regions will use final sediment quality criteria for various purposes, including establishing
priorities for sites needing further assessment, targeting areas for potential remediation and prevention efforts,
and supporting the development of state water quality standards based on sediment quality criteria. 
In each of the designated AOC's located in the United States contaminated sediments have been identified as causing
at least one of the 14 beneficial use impairments listed in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The RAPs are to
specify the beneficial uses that are impaired, the remedial measures needed to restore beneficial uses, and an implementation
schedule. For those AOC's already identified most of the Stage 1 RAPs (problem identification) have already been
completed and most Stage 2 RAPs (remedial actions) are in preparation, therefore, the proposed criteria will be most
applicable for the identification of future AOC's and development of their Stage 1 and 2 RAPs. 
The International Joint Commission (IJC) has published ``listing/delisting criteria'' for adding and removing
a site from the AOC list. The listing/delisting criteria refer to various tools to measure the impacts on beneficial
uses, including the contaminant levels in fish and wildlife, numerical water quality criteria for surface waters,
and, in the case of restrictions on dredging activities, the extent to which sediment contamination may exceed standards,
guidelines, or IJC objectives. The EPA will look to the Great Lakes States to review sediment quality data for each
AOC in relation to the possible impairment of beneficial uses and to consider 304(a) sediment quality criteria and
any other more recent data or relevant site specific data to design preventive and remedial actions for contaminated
sediment. For example, EPA in cooperation with Great Lakes States and the Canadian Federal and Provincial Governments,
may use the sediment quality criteria as one means to prioritize sites for action by comparing the toxic contaminant
concentration in the sediments to the most stringent of either Canadian or U.S. standards or guidelines. 


Superfund Program Uses 


The SQC have been developed primarily to assist in pollution prevention and water quality control activities. Due
to many factors, such as the potential for causing environmental damage through distrubing contaminated sediments,
they are not intended as mandatory levels to be met in clean-up efforts. EPA recognizes that, in particular circumstances,
it may be appropriate to use natural recovery as a sediment remediation tool. Superfund is primarily a remediation
program concerned with the clean-up or remediation of sites that have been contaminated. 
The Superfund program expects to use SQC as a tool to evaluate sites that may require assessment and possible remediation.
For example, if a site has been shown to exceed SQC levels, it may be given higher priority for assessment with the Hazard
Ranking System (HRS) to help determine if the site should be added to the National Priorities List (NPL). NPL sites
typically require long term remediation efforts. In general, the Superfund program expects to employ SQC for sites
with sediment contamination as part of a tiered testing protocol. 
Given the above approach to the assessment of contaminated sediments, Superfund's approach is consistent with the
conclusions of both the Science Advisory Board's November 1992 review of the criteria and the Agency: ``The use of
SQC's as stand-alone, pass-fail criteria is not recommended for all applications.'' and ``* * * the
inappropriate uses of the SQC's, such as mandatory target clean-up standards, [should be stated] unless additional
site specific studies are completed.'' At the same time, SQC's might be considered water quality criteria as referenced
in section 121(d)(2)(A) of CERCLA, and thus potential Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARAR's).
Similarly, if SQC are adopted by States as part of water quality standards, they could be considered as ARARs. The Agency
requests comment on the appropriateness of the use of SQC as ARARs and if so what aspects of the remedial action they
should affect.

RCRA Corrective Action 


The Office of Solid Waste will include the 304(a) sediment quality criteria as assessment tools in RCRA Facility Investigations
(RFI's) guidance. Currently the guidance warns about potential sediment quality problems but does not recommend
specific tests to evaluate the ecological and human health risks posed by contaminated sediments. 


Other Programs


A variety of other regulatory and nonregulatory programs are looking to sediment quality criteria as a benchmark
for contaminated sediment evaluations. The dredging program (Sec. 404 of the CWA and 102 of MPRSA), which is jointly
implemented by the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA, may incorporate sediment quality criteria into Tier II of the
dredged material management plan which is currently under development. Other examples of potential sediment quality
criteria uses are to: (1) Proactively monitor to ensure uncontaminated sediments remain uncontaminated; (2) predict
the need to arrest increasing contamination before harm occurs; (3) establish the spatial extent of contamination
to determine the potential costs/benefits of clean-up and remediation efforts; and/or (4) identify sources of contamination
via toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) protocols that link toxic contaminants to sources. In some cases,
sediment criteria alone would be sufficient to identify and to establish goals for remediation or clean-up of contaminated
sediment. In other cases the sediment criteria should be supplemented with biological sampling and testing and more
extensive chemical monitoring before decisions are made. 
Neither the Science Advisory Board nor the Agency believes the sediment quality criteria should be used as ``pass/fail''
criteria or mandatory clean-up levels for all programs. It is often more environmentally sound to allow clean sediments
to cover contaminated sediments over time than to remove the sediments in question. The removal of contaminated sediments
may in and of itself cause physical harm to bottom communities as well as cause resuspension and dispersion of the contaminant
being removed. The costs of clean-up may also be prohibitive because of the level or areal extent of contamination
and the disposal requirements for contaminated sediments. Therefore, EPA expects that the sediment quality criteria
will be used in a tiered approach to evaluate the level and areal extent of sediment contamination and the risk associated
with a variety of clean-up or remediation alternatives. 
In combination, the above authorities provide a comprehensive mechanism for monitoring, assessing and researching
the effects of pollutants on the Nation's waters and regulating the discharges in order to eliminate or limit their
potential impacts on water quality. EPA also expects to publish, in the near future, an EPA Contaminated Sediment
Management Strategy, which will provide guidance on the application of the sediment quality criteria. Though not
specifically requested at this time, comments received in connection with this notice that discuss implementation
issues will be considered in the development of the draft strategy. 




V. Description of Sediment Criteria Pollutants 


Criteria pollutants were selected for their known toxicity, hydrophobicity, and persistence. The following section
lists each chemical, its CAS number, sediment quality criteria value expressed as ug pollutant per gram of organic
carbon within the sediment, and a brief description of the chemical, its potential sources and uses. The criteria
documents themselves provide details on the range of uncertainty that surrounds the criteria values provided below.



Acenaphthene 


(CAS No. 83-32-9) 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 


Freshwater: 130 

m

g/g

oc 


Saltwater: 230 

m

g/g

oc 






Dihydro-acenaphthylene or 1,8 ethylenenapthalene occurs in coal and is released during the high temperature carbonization
or coking of coal. Acenaphthene is also used as a dye intermediate in the manufacture of plastics, insecticides and
fungicides, and has been detected in cigarette smoke and gasoline condensates. It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.



Dieldrin 


(CAS No. 60-57-1) 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 


Freshwater: 11 

m

g/g

oc 


Saltwater: 20 

m

g/g

oc 






Prior to the cancellation of its registration (1974), dieldrin was one of the most widely used chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides. Prior to its cancellation (1974), aldrin was used in greater quantity than dieldrin but quickly transforms
into dieldrin in the environment. The chemicals were primarily used to control insect pests on corn and later on citrus
fruits. 


Endrin 


(CAS No. 72-20-8) 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 


Freshwater: 4.2 

m

g/g

oc 


Saltwater: 0.76 

m

g/g

oc 





Endrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. Prior to its cancellation (1986) it was used in the agricultural
chemical industry for the control of pests on fruits and vegetation. 


Fluoranthene 


(CAS No. 206-44-0) 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 


Freshwater: 620 

m

g/g

oc 


Saltwater: 300 

m

g/g

oc 





Fluoranthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is a combustion product produced by the pyrolysis of organic raw
materials, such as coal and petroleum at high temperature. It is ubiquitous in the environment. 


Phenanthrene 


(CAS No. 85-01-8) 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 


Freshwater: 180 

m

g/g

oc 


Saltwater: 240

V. Description of the Technical Basis for Deriving Numerical National Sediment Quality Criteria for Nonionic Organic
Contaminants Using Equilibrium Partitioning



The Technical Basis for Deriving Sediment Quality Criteria for Nonionic Organic Contaminants for the Protection
of Benthic Organisms by Using Equilibrium Partitioning presents the research performed and data collected in the
development of the equilibrium partitioning approach to deriving sediment quality criteria. (See Section I entitled:
``Availability of Documents''.) 



VI. Description of Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Benthic
Organisms



The Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Benthic Organisms provides
guidance on the methodology which is appropriate for modifying nationally applicable sediment quality criteria
on a site-specific basis. The document details the procedures and data necessary to perform the modification that
may be required because of unique sensitivities of site species or partitioning processes at the site. (See Section
I entitled: ``Availability of Documents''.) 



Request for Comments 



EPA is soliciting comments on the scientific soundness of the criteria development methodology and the proposed
criteria themselves. The sediment quality criteria, like the surface water quality criteria, are ambient criteria
describing aquatic conditions which support designated uses. The merit and validity of these criteria must stand
alone without regard to permit limit derivation, sediment remediation costs, etc. Specifically the Agency requests
comment on the five sediment quality criteria documents described above, the document entitled ``Technical Basis
for Deriving Sediment Quality Criteria for Nonionic Organic Contaminants for the Protection of Benthic Organisms
by Using Equilibrium Partitioning'' and the ``Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria
for the Protection of Benthic Organisms''. EPA is also interested in receiving comments on the following issues:




1. Site Specific Criteria Modifications 



Under section 304(a) a state may develop its own water quality criteria on either a state-wide basis or on a site-specific
basis to be protective of unique waters. EPA is considering the same approach for the developement of sediment quality
criteria. Section 131.11(b)(1) of EPA's regulations allows states to modify 304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific
conditions, when adopting water quality standards based on such criteria guidance and EPA is considering allowing
similar site-specific modification for water quality standards based on EPA's sediment quality criteria guidance.
Technical persons have identified a number of reasons both supporting and challenging the appropriateness of allowing
site specific modifications to sediment criteria. EPA is particularly interested in receiving comments and ideas
on site specific criteria modifications. A more detailed discussion of these issues can be found on this topic on page
99 of the Technical Basis document identified above.

2. Need for Separate Sediment Quality Criteria To Protect Fresh Water and Marine Species 



For certain chemicals (acenaphthene, dieldrin, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene), statistical analysis of all
the data used in the derivation of water quality criteria revealed no significant differences in the relative sensitivity
of fresh water and marine species. Further, there are no known chemical or physical properties of the above chemicals
that would support a difference in toxicity and bioavailability between aquatic environments. (These comparisons
do not hold for endrin.) However, EPA customarily has developed separate criteria for saltwater and freshwater to
avoid having the sensitivity of species in one aquatic environment drive environmental decisions and regulation
in the other environment. Although these sediment quality criteria are derived separately for freshwater and saltwater,
EPA seeks comment on the appropriateness of a single sediment quality criteria applicable to both aquatic environments
after first demonstrating equivalency of sensitivity (for these and future criteria). 


Acenaphthene 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 

Freshwater: 130  u g/g

oc

 Saltwater: 230  u g/g

oc



 

This difference is less than a factor of 2. 


Dieldrin 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 

Freshwater: 11  u g/g

oc

 Saltwater: 20  u g/g

oc



 

This difference is less than a factor of 2. 



Fluoranthene 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 

Freshwater: 620  u g/g

oc

 Saltwater: 300  u g/g

oc






This difference is less than a factor of 2. 


Phenanthrene 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 

Freshwater: 180  u g/g

oc

 Saltwater: 240  u g/g

oc



 

This difference is less than a factor of 2. 


Endrin 


Sediment Quality Criteria Value: 

Freshwater: 4.2  u g/g

oc

 Saltwater: 0.76  u g/g

oc





This difference is approximately a factor of 5 which is statistically significant and would require that endrin have
both criteria values. 


3. Level of Protection 


Existing section 304(a) criteria are intended to protect a balanced and indigenous aquatic community by protecting
most individuals within sensitive species. As a practical matter, the basic aquatic life procedure approximates
the goal by deriving criteria to protect most individuals in the 95th percentile (most sensitive) of the tested genera.
This is done by basing acute criteria on LC50 or similar tests, and dividing the final result by two to protect most individuals,
as opposed to protecting only 50%. Less sensitive species are more fully protected, while more sensitive species
are somewhat protected. There are exceptions procedures which override this basic approach where necessary to protect
wildlife, plants, or commercially important aquatic species. See 50 FR 30784, July 29, 1985, for details. Tested
species are selected to include a minimum data set of specified aquatic species. As such, tested species are considered
to be surrogates for untested species. This same approach is currently proposed for benthic organisms via the sediment
quality criteria. Comment is being sought on the appropriateness of this approach. 



4. Use of SQC as ARAR's in the CERCLA Program 



The availability of sediment quality criteria for adoption by States into State water quality standards provides
for the potential requirement in those States that the SQC be used as ARAR's. As discussed earlier, EPA is concerned
that this ``mandatory clean-up level'' may be an inappropriate use of the proposed criteria. The Agency requests
comment on the use of SQC as ARAR's should they be adopted into State water quality standards. 



5. Definition of Sediments to Which Sediment Quality Criteria Apply 



The criteria documents define sediments to which SQC are applicable as those ``permanently inundated with water,
intertidal sediment and to sediments inundated periodically for durations sufficient to permit development of
benthic assemblages.'' The criteria are not intended to apply to ``sediments occasionally inundated so that they
support terrestrial species.'' The Agency believes the appropriate uses of SQC are for those sediments that maintain,
or have the potential to maintain if not contaminated, benthic aquatic assemblages. Comments that discuss a broader
or narrower definition or that support the proposed definition are requested.

approved and assigned an OMB control number. The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced by separate
notice in the 

Federal Register

.

The burden for collecting the required information is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Information on the estimated public reporting burden is provided under the heading, Other Matters.
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to: Jack Holston, FmHA Clearance Officer, Farmers Home Administration, AG Box 0743, Department
of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-3200; and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of
Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Washington, DC 20503.



I. Background



One of the core items of President Clinton's economic proposals is the need to empower America's distressed rural
and urban communities. His Empowerment Zone proposal represents a new approach to the problems of distressed communities.
It emphasizes a bottom-up community based strategy rather than the traditional top-down bureaucratic approach.
It is a strategy to address economic, human, community, and physical development problems and opportunities in a
comprehensive fashion.

Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted to implement the President's vision, authorizes the
Secretary of Department of Agriculture to designate up to three Empowerment Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities
in rural areas. (Unless otherwise noted, all references in this Notice to Empowerment Zones also include Enterprise
Communities.) This Notice invites applications from State and local governments, regional planning agencies,
non-profit organizations, community-based organizations, or other locally-based organizations for the Secretarial
designations as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities.

The program is intended to combine the resources of the Federal Government with those of State and local governments,
educational institutions and the private and non-profit sectors to implement community-developed strategic plans
for economic development. The Federal Government has taken steps to coordinate Federal assistance in support of
the Zones, including expedited processing, priority funding, and waiver of regulations. To that end, President
Clinton has issued an Executive Order that creates a Community Enterprise Board chaired by Vice President Al Gore
to ensure the success of the Empowerment Zone initiative.



II. Eligibility



The statute specifies certain criteria that must apply in order for an area to be eligible for Empowerment Zone designation,
including geographic size, population, poverty rate by census tract (or by block numbering areas when the community
is not delineated by census tracts), pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress of the area. The details
of these requirements are described in the interim rule governing the program published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

.

This information must be provided in the application. USDA will accept certifications of the data by the State and
local governments, subject to further verification of the data prior to designation as a Zone.



III. Designation Factors



The statute specifies three factors to be considered by the Secretary in designating Empowerment Zones: (1) The effectiveness
of the Strategic Plan; (2) the effectiveness of the assurances provided in support of the Strategic Plan; and (3) other
criteria to be specified by the Secretary. Each of these factors is discussed in greater detail in the interim rule
(The Strategic Plan is described in the interim rule at 7 CFR 25.200(c)).



IV. Timing and Location of Application Submissions



Applications may be obtained from any FmHA State Office and from Rural EZ/EC State Contacts (see Appendix A) or by sending
an Internet Mail message to: info@ezec.usda.gov. An application may be submitted 30 days from the date of publication
of the interim rule, which governs the Empowerment Zone program. The deadline for receipt of the application will
be 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time, Thursday, June 30, 1994. Applications received after that date and time will
not be accepted, and will be returned to the sender. As the applications require certifications from the State and
local governments, we cannot accept applications sent by FAX or through the Internet system. The original application
and one (1) copy should be sent to: US Department of Agriculture, Rural Development Administration, EZ/EC Team, room
5405, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250-3200.

Applicants will be notified of an incomplete application. Provided that the application is received at the above
address with sufficient time before the deadline, applicant will be given an opportunity to provide the missing information
to USDA.



V. Notice of Intent to Apply



Applicants should fill out and mail a Notice of Intent to Apply. The form of notice is located at the end of the Empowerment
Zone Application (see Appendix B), or may be obtained by sending an Internet Mail message to: info@ezec.usda.gov
to obtain the notice. Applicants may wish to submit the form in order to be placed on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
Community mailing list. While the notice is not mandatory for participation in the program, USDA encourages the submission
of the notice as it will permit the Department to provide applicants with updated information on program requirements
as well as information on technical assistance.

VI. Miscellaneous 


Empowerment Zone designation does not constitute a Federal action for provisions of the Uniform Relocation Act.
However, any activity constituting a Federal action that may result from such a designation may be subject to the provision
of this Act, as well as any other statutory or regulatory provisions governing the particular Federal action. 


VII. Other Matters 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements contained in this Notice have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). No person may be subjected
to a penalty for failure to comply with these information collection requirements until they have been approved and
assigned an OMB control number. The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the

ACTION:

 Notice inviting applications. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice invites applications from States and local governments nominating urban areas for designation as Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities, as those terms are defined in this Notice and in an interim rule published elsewhere
in today's 

Federal Register

. The interim rule provides the guidance on contents of the applications. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Paperwork Reduction Act 




The reader should refer to the interim rule, published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

, for information on the information collection requirements of the rule and this notice. 




I. Background 




At the core of President Clinton's economic proposals to Congress and to the American people is the need to empower
America's distressed communities. His Empowerment Zone proposal represents a new approach to the problems of distressed
communities. It uses a bottom-up community based strategy rather than a top-down bureaucratic approach. It is a strategy
to empower residents and all sections of a community to come together to create jobs and opportunities. 


Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted to implement the President's vision, authorizes the
Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to designate up to six Empowerment Zones and up to 65 Enterprise
Communities in urban areas and the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to designate up to three Empowerment
Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities in rural areas. (Unless otherwise noted, all references in this Notice to
Empowerment Zones also include Enterprise Communities.) This Notice invites applications from State and local
governments for the purpose of nominating urban areas to be designated as Empowerment Zones. 


The program is intended to combine the resources of the Federal government with those of State and local governments,
educational institutions, and the private and non-profit sectors to implement the Strategic Plan. The Federal government
will take steps to coordinate Federal assistance in support of the Zones, including expedited processing, priority
funding, and working to overcome programmatic regulatory and statutory impediments. To that end, a Presidential
Directive has been issued that creates a Community Enterprise Board headed by Vice President Gore to carry out these
responsibilities. 




II. Eligibility 




The statute specifies certain criteria that must apply in order for an area to be eligible for Empowerment Zone designation,
including geographic size, population, poverty rate by census tract (or where an area is not tracted, generally in
rural areas, by the equivalent of census tracts_block numbering areas), pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general
distress of the area. The details of these requirements are described in the interim rule governing the program, published
elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

.
