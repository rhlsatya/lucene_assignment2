Food Stamp Program_Distribution of Employment and Training Performance-Based Funds


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

State agencies that are responsible for administering the Food Stamp Program are required to operate the Food Stamp
Employment and Training (E&T) program. To assist in the operation of their E&T programs, the State agencies
receive a Federal E&T grant, a portion of which is distributed on the basis of each State agency's performance
in serving the target population. This rule proposes to freeze the performance-based grants at the level the State
agencies received in Fiscal Year 1993, for two years from promulgation of this rule in final form. The Department is
proposing this action because of statutory amendments to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, made by the Food, Agriculture,
Conservation and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (December 13, 1991).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Classification


Executive Order 12866


This proposed rule is issued in conformance with E.O. 12866.


Executive Order 12372


The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.551. For reasons
set forth in the final rule related Notice(s) of 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from
the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.


Executive Order 12778


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_State administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures
issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities)
or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures
issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through
612). Christopher J. Martin, Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this
action does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare
agencies will be the most affected because they administer the Program and the rule will affect the performance-based
funding levels for each State agency.


Paperwork Reduction Act


This proposed rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

Background


Under section 6(d)(4) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(4)), State agencies are required
to operate the Food Stamp Employment and Training (E&T) program. The purpose of the E&T program is to place
able-bodied food stamp recipients in educational or work-related activities that will increase their chances of
obtaining regular employment, and thus, reduce their need for public assistance.
Food stamp recipients who are required to register for work as specified under section 6(d)(4) of the Food Stamp Act
are expected, if assigned, to participate in an E&T component as a condition of eligibility for receiving food
stamps. Work registrants who refuse or fail to comply with an assigned E&T activity or component are ineligible
to receive benefits for two months or until they comply with the assigned activity, whichever comes first.
The Food Stamp Act provides State agencies flexibility in operating their E&T programs. To meet the needs of their
work registrant populations, the State agencies have discretion in determining which components will be offered
to E&T participants and in targeting services toward certain work registrants. However, to avoid fiscal sanction,
State agencies must meet performance standards specified under 7 CFR 273.7(o). In Fiscal Years (FYs) 1990 and 1991,
the State agencies were required to place at least 50 percent of their mandatory E&T participants into E&T
components. In FY 1992 performance standards were lowered to 10 percent in response to section 907(b) of Public Law
102-237. For the purpose of determining each State agency's performance level, a person is considered ``placed''
in a component each time they begin a component or fail to comply with an assigned activity and are sent a Notice of Adverse
Action (NOAA). The performance formula also includes participants who are exempt from work registration but elect
to participate in the E&T program (i.e., volunteers). State agencies may, but are not required to, serve volunteers.


Federal Funding for E&T Programs


Section 16(h), 7 U.S.C. 2025(h) of the Food Stamp Act authorizes the Secretary to distribute $75 million each year
in unmatched Federal funds to State agencies to operate their E&T programs. The State agencies may also receive
Federal matching funds for administrative costs above the initial Federal E&T grant. The Federal and State governments
equally share the costs for transportation or dependent care reimbursements that are provided to E&T participants.
Currently, participants must receive monthly reimbursements of up to $25 for transportation and other expenses
related E&T to E&T participation. Public Law 103-66 removes the monthly cap on dependent care expenses
effective September 1, 1994. Participants may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred, not to exceed the applicable
local market rate for the services.
As specified under section 16(h)(1)(C) of the Food Stamp Act, $60 million of the Federal E&T grant_the nonperformance
based portion_is distributed on the basis of each State agency's work registrant population as a percent of the total
work registrant population nationwide. Pursuant to Section 16(h)(1)(B), the remaining $15 million of the Federal
E&T grant must be distributed on the basis of State agency performance. The Food Stamp Act does not address the
methodology for distributing performance-based funds.
The Department published final rules on June 9, 1989 (54 FR 24664) that specify how these funds are distributed. Under
7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(i)(B), performance-based E&T funds are distributed on the basis of the number of people placed
into E&T components. A person is considered placed for the purpose of distributing performance-based funds
if the person is required to work register and (1) begins an E&T component; or (2) fails to comply with the E&T
requirement and is sent a Notice of Adverse Action (NOAA) by the State agency. Volunteers are not included in the calculations
for distributing performance-based funds. To be eligible to receive performance-based funds, the State agency
must meet the performance standard as set forth under 7 CFR 273.7(o).

The current method for distributing the $15 million performance-based funds encourages State agencies to serve
large numbers of work registrants (i.e., broad-based) with low cost components such as job search and job search training.
When implementing the E&T program in FY 1987, the Department encouraged broad-based programs because existing
research indicated that they had a positive impact on a participant's future chances of obtaining employment or ending
his or her dependence on public assistance. Given these results, the Department believed the possible benefits participants
should be shared by as many participants as possible. 
Since implementation of the E&T program in 1987, several things have shifted the focus of the program away from
the broad-based perspective. One was the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS)
program for non-exempt recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). With a combination of matching
Federal funds of up to $1 billion annually, State agencies must offer a number of mandatory and voluntary components
that are generally more intensive than those offered by the Food Stamp E&T program. By October 1992 JOBS had to
be implemented statewide throughout the country. Several State agencies have sought to make the two programs more
similar. A number have started directing their E&T funds toward a more targeted population. 
Results of studies assessing the effectiveness of broad-based work programs have been published in recent years,
including the Department's evaluation of the E&T program (See ``Evaluation of the Food Stamp Employment and
Training Program, Final Report,'' Abt Associates, June 1990). This study concluded that the broad-based E&T
program in operation in FY 1988 did not have a significant effect on a participant's ability to find work or increase
work hours or earnings. Without a positive effect on employment and earnings, the study further concluded that participation
in the E&T program did not significantly reduce a person's need for food stamp benefits. 
In light of these circumstances, Congress made certain amendments to the E&T provisions of the Food Stamp Act
that allow, or even encourage, the State agencies to provide more intensive services towards a targeted population.

One amendment in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, (Pub. L. 100-435, 102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988), mandated
that the Department implement outcome-based standards in place of the current process-based (i.e., placements)
system. As specified under Public Law 100-435, outcome-based standards would measure job placement rates,
wage rates, job retention rates, households ceasing to need food stamp benefits, improved education levels and the
extent to which persons volunteer for E&T services. Public Law 100-435 also required that the outcome-based
standards encourage State agencies to serve participants with barriers to employment (e.g., illiteracy or long-term
food stamp dependency). Therefore, the E&T provisions under Public Law 100-435 reflect Congress' concern
that, to be successful, Federal work programs must apply resources towards disadvantaged populations with barriers
to employment and that performance must be measured in terms of successful outcomes rather than placements. 
The Department was required under Public Law 100-435 to implement outcome-based performance standards by
April 1, 1991. The implementation date was later amended to October 1, 1991 through the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic
Hunger Relief Act (Pub. L. 101-624, 104 Stat. 3359, November 28, 1990). This date was changed again by the Food,
Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-237, 105 Stat. 1818, December 13, 1991).
Under section 907(a) of Public Law 102-237, outcome-based performance standards must be implemented no later
than one year after the DHHS publishes final outcome-based performance standards for its JOBS program. This delay
will allow the Department of Agriculture and the DHHS to coordinate outcome-based performance standards for the
two programs. 
In the interim period before outcome-based performance standards are implemented, section 907(b) of Public Law
102-237 reduced the annual performance standard for States from 50 percent to no more than 10 percent in FYs 1992
and 1993. The provisions show clear Congressional intent that the State agencies no longer be held to a standard requiring
service to a large number of participants. Rather, under Public Law 102-237, the State agencies must be provided
the flexibility to target a smaller population with more intensive components. State agencies are not required to
implement a more intensive E&T program and may continue to operate broad-based programs. 
Section 907(b) of Public Law 102-237 was effective on September 30, 1991. On February 12, 1992, the Department
notified State agencies in writing of the reduction in performance standards for FY 1992. The Department will publish
a rule implementing the revised performance standards in the near future.

The amendments made under Public Law 102-237 support efforts to target the E&T program towards fewer, harder
to employ participants or to offer more intensive components to a smaller segment of the food stamp population. Given
these amendments, the Department believes it must suspend the current method for distributing the $15 million performance-based
funds and, in its place, implement a method which will not penalize State agencies that place fewer participants and/or
operate more intensive components. If the current method for distributing performance funds is left unchanged,
State agencies that elect to target fewer participants will lose performance-based funding. Thus, the current method
for distributing funds is a barrier to the State agencies' implementation of amendments made by Public Law 102-237.

The Department considered numerous options for revising the methodology for distributing performance-based funds.
All options were viewed with two purposes in mind_to remove barriers for those State agencies that wish to target their
E&T programs and to reward State agencies equitably for their performance. After careful consideration of these
options, the Department is proposing in this rule to freeze performance-based funds at the levels the State agencies
received in FY 1993. This rule proposes that the freeze of performance-based funding remain in effect for two years
from the date of promulgation of this rule in final form. 
On February 12, 1992, the Department notified State agencies in writing of the freeze of performance-based funding
to the FY 1993 level. FY 1994 performance-based funds were distributed based on this methodology. 
The Department believes there are several advantages for freezing performance-based funds. First, the proposed
freeze does not prohibit State agencies from either modifying their E&T program to target smaller populations
or retaining the current broad-based program. Therefore, this proposal would provide the State agencies with the
flexibility to move their E&T programs in the direction they believe is most appropriate for their work registrant
population. However, no State agency would be penalized for meeting the lower standard. Second, the State agencies
would know the amount of their performance-based funding levels for the foreseeable future. 
In reaching its decision to propose a freeze on performance-based funds, the Department considered numerous other
options. These included: (1) Distributing the funds on the basis that is currently used for distributing the $60 million
nonperformance-based funds (i.e., work registrant population); (2) rewarding performance on the basis of how many
participants complete a component or leave a component to take a job; (3) modifying the current definition of a ``placement''
(e.g., include volunteers and/or exclude NOAA's); and (4) providing extra credit to State agencies that target hard-to-employ
populations (e.g., allow credit only for service to certain hard-to-employ groups such as long-term recipients
of food stamp benefits or individuals who have not completed high school). 
Even though each of these options has merit, the Department rejected the options in favor of a freeze. The option for
distributing the $75 million Federal E&T grant on the basis of each State agency's work registrant population
was rejected because it would not distribute the $15 million E&T funds on the basis of performance, as required
by law. 
The second option, rewarding performance for completed E&T components or job entries was rejected because it
would base performance on outcomes. Because section 907(a) of Public Law 102-237 specifically delays outcome-based
performance standards until coordination with the JOBS program can be achieved, the Department believes the option
would not be consistent with the law. The Department is also reluctant to implement changes to program areas which
will, in all likelihood, be changed again when the outcome-based performance standards are implemented. 
Under the third option, the Department would have redefined ``placements'' in calculating the success of a State
agency's performance. None of the possible redefinitions examined, however, would have resulted in moving away
from rewarding States with high numbers of placements over those with low numbers. Thus, all of the possible changes
would have penalized States that reduce the number of people served_contrary to the Congressional intent underlying
the amendment.

The last option, providing extra credit to State agencies targeting populations with the greatest barriers to employment,
was rejected because of its administrative burdens. The option would have resulted in better targeting of hard-to-employ
populations, and thus, taken State agencies in the direction the program is heading. However, the Department is reluctant
to implement a major increase in reporting requirements for a relatively short period of time before outcome-based
performance standards are implemented. The Department further believes that the definition of hard-to-employ
populations should be coordinated with the JOBS program during development of outcome-based performance standards.

Accordingly, the Department is proposing to amend  273.7(d)(1)(i)(B) in this rulemaking to specify that the
$15 million E&T funds will be frozen at the levels the State agencies received in FY 1993. In accordance with current
rules, performance-based funds will be allocated by the ratio of the number of E&T mandatories placed in an E&T
program in an eligible State to the number of E&T mandatories placed in all eligible States in Calendar Year 1991.

The rule proposes that the FY 1993 levels be used for the two Fiscal Years following the year in which this rule is published
in final form. The Department is anxious to receive suggestions for ways the performance-based funds could be distributed
beyond that, until outcome-based performance standards are implemented. 
The State agencies must continue to meet established performance standards (i.e., 10 percent in FY 1994) to be eligible
for their share of these funds as is required under 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(i)(B). Should a State agency fail to meet the 10
percent performance standard in a given fiscal year, it would be ineligible to receive its share of performance-based
funding in the second following fiscal year. For instance, if a State agency fails to meet the 10 percent performance
standard in FY 1992, it would be ineligible to receive performance-based funding in FY 1994. Should this occur, the
Department is proposing in this rule to recalculate the performance-based funds to the State agencies on the basis
of Calendar Year 1991 data, but excluding the States which did not place at least 10 percent of their eligible population.

As required under current rules, State agencies may not submit corrected FNS 583 reports any later than March 1 if they
are to be used in determining whether a State agency is eligible for performance-based funding. 


Implementation 


The proposed provisions in this rule are effective retroactively to October 1, 1993. The State agencies are not required
to take any action to implement these provisions.

promulgation of this rule in final form, if the data on the reports show that a State agency did not meet its performance
standard or a good cause determination was not made by FNS by March 1, the State agency shall not be eligible for performance-based

Policies of General Application; Flood Insurance Protection



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend the amount of flood insurance coverage required of recipients of certain SBA assistance.
Under this proposal, flood insurance would be required in an amount equal to the lesser of the sum of all liens on the
property (including any SBA lien) plus, if the SBA assistance is unsecured, the outstanding balance of the SBA assistance
or the insurable value of the property, but in no event would the required insurance exceed the maximum flood insurance
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Prior to May 10, 1983, a borrower under any of SBA's financial assistance programs was required to carry and maintain
flood insurance in the amount of the SBA loan balance, even if the insurable value of the collateral for the loan were
greater and higher amounts of flood insurance were available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended
(the ``NFI Act''). See 13 CFR 116.11(c) (1983). On May 10, 1983, SBA amended this regulation to require borrowers to
purchase the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFI Act, not to exceed the insurable value of the property.
48 FR 20933.




The purpose of the amendment was to assure that the value of SBA's collateral would be protected from floods in flood
prone areas. SBA had realized that flood insurance in the amount of the SBA loan balance was inadequate protection
when SBA's interest in the collateral was junior to another lender. If, for example, a disaster loan applicant had
an existing mortgage on his property in favor of a commercial lender, SBA would assume a junior lienholder's position
as security for the disaster loan. If a subsequent flood disaster occurred and the borrower had been carrying flood
insurance only in the amount of the SBA loan, the insurance proceeds would be applied first to the commercial loan and
would be insufficient to repay SBA. The requirement of ``full insurable value'' insurance prevented this outcome.

However, it also forced many borrowers to purchase insurance far in excess of the loan they would receive from the Agency.
Moreover, in the ten years since the adoption of the May 10, 1983 final rule, SBA has observed a number of loan application
cancellations as a result of the high cost of full insurable value insurance relative to the principal amount of the
SBA loan. In some of those cases, the cost of the insurance may have even approached or exceeded the amount of the SBA
assistance.

SBA recognizes that full insurable value insurance confers a benefit on the borrower (protection for his equity in
the property), the Agency (reduction in the need for future disaster assistance), and the national flood insurance
fund (bolstering of the fund's reserves). Nevertheless, the benefit comes at an additional cost to the borrower at
a time when the borrower may be suffering significant economic distress from a flood disaster.

SBA has come to the conclusion that it can adequately protect its interest in the collateral or in the general credit
of the borrower without forcing the borrower to purchase full insurable value flood insurance. Without returning
to the pre-1983 rule, which placed SBA's interest in the collateral at risk if there were senior lienholders, SBA believes
it can improve the present rule to protect SBA's interest without unnecessarily burdening the borrower.

Because SBA's real interest in the collateral exists only to the extent of the outstanding balance of the loan, SBA
loans can be adequately protected even if insurance does not cover the full value of the collateral, so long as insurance
does cover the amount of all outstanding liens (including any SBA lien) on the property plus, in the event SBA's assistance
is unsecured, the outstanding balance of such assistance. Then, if a borrower were to suffer a subsequent flooding
loss and recover insurance proceeds, SBA would likely be reimbursed in full for the outstanding amount of its loan.
Of course, if that flooding were to cause damage in excess of all liens (plus the amount of SBA's loan if SBA were unsecured),
such ``excess'' damage would not be covered by insurance and would erode any equity the borrower might have had in the
property.

After considering the issues discussed above, SBA has concluded that its flood insurance requirement should be amended.
Accordingly, SBA is hereby proposing to revise Section 116.11(c) to require that applicants for SBA financial assistance
who are located in a special flood hazard area obtain and maintain flood insurance in an amount equal to the lesser of:
(1) All outstanding liens (including SBA's lien) on the property plus, if the SBA assistance is unsecured, the outstanding
balance of the SBA assistance or (2) the insurable value of the property, but in no event would the required insurance
exceed the flood insurance available under the NFI Act. This provision applies to the following programs: 7(a) business
loans, 7(b) disaster loans, sections 501, 502 and 503 development company loans, lease guarantees, small business
investment companies and pollution control guarantees. (13 CFR 116.10 (1993))

It is expected that most of the time the insurable value of the collateral will exceed the amount of all liens on the property
(plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured). Thus, for most borrowers, the amount of flood insurance required would be
determined by the liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured) so long as flood insurance in that amount
were available under the NFI Act. On those occasions when the insurable value of the collateral dips below the liens
on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured), only enough insurance to protect the collateral would be required.

Special Conditions, Ballistic Recovery Systems, Modified for Small General Aviation Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed special conditions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes special conditions for the supplementary type certification of the Ballistic Recovery Systems,
Inc., parachute recovery system installed in small general aviation airplanes. This system is referred to as the
GARD. Modifications to airplanes using this system will incorporate novel or unusual design features associated
with a parachute recovery system for which the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards. This notice contains the proposed safety standards that the administrator finds necessary to
establish a level of safety equivalent to the original certification basis for these airplanes



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Comments Invited




Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of these special conditions by submitting such written
data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket or notice number
and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing
date for comments specified in this notice will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on these proposals.
The proposals contained in this notice may change in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be
available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested parties both before and after the closing date for submission
of comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking
will be filed in the docket.



Background



On January 12, 1987, Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc. (BRS), 9242 Hudson Boulevard, Lake Elmo, Minnesota 55042,
filed an application for a supplemental type certificate (STC) to install the GARD-150 parachute recovery
system on Cessna 150/A150 Series and 152/A152 Model Airplanes. Subsequently they received the STC under Special
Condition 23-ACE-33, dated November 17, 1987. The parachute recovery system is intended to recover an
airplane in emergency situations such as mid-air collision, loss of engine power, loss of airplane control, severe
structural failure, pilot disorientation, or pilot incapacitation with a passenger on board. The GARD-150
system, which is only used as a last resort, is intended to prevent serious injuries to the airplane occupants by parachuting
the airplane to the ground.

BRS followed their STC on the Cessna 150/A150 and 152/A152 Series with a request for special conditions on a GARD system
that would be applicable to most general aviation airplanes. The nature of the parachute recovery system applies
to most general aviation airplanes instead of each airplane model needing separate special conditions.

Parachute recovery systems typically consist of a parachute packed in a canister mounted on the airframe. A solid
propellant rocket motor or compressed air may deploy the canopy and is usually located on the side of the canister.
A door positioned above the canister seals the canister, parachute canopy, and rocket motor from the elements and
provides free exit when the canopy is deployed. These systems are deployed by a mechanical pull handle mounted so that
the pilot and passenger can reach it. At least two separate and independent actions are required to deploy the system.

A four-cable bridle attaches the canopy bridle to the airplane primary structure. The cable lengths are designed
to provide the best airplane touchdown attitude. The cables are routed externally and covered with small frangible
fairings from the fuselage exit holes to the attach points.The applicants must supplement the FAA-approved Flight
Manual as part of the STC. The supplement will describe the system, define the operating envelope with appropriate
warnings, and define required system maintenance and inspection information. A separate FAA approved Operating
Manual describing the previous items will be provided for those airplanes that do not have an FAA-approved Flight
Manual.Recommended placards should be located near the pull handle in clear view of the pilot to identify the system
and operating envelope, state deployment actions, and provide appropriate warnings. A warning placard should also
be located on the canister near the rocket motor.

Discussion

The installation of parachute recovery systems in part 23 airplanes was not envisioned when the certification basis
for these airplanes was established. In addition, the Administrator has determined that current parts 21 and 23 do
not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for a parachute recovery system; therefore, this system is
considered a novel and unusual design feature.Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part
of the type certification basis if the Administrator finds that the airworthiness standards designated in accordance
with  21.101(b)(2) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards because of the novel and unusual
design features of the airplane modification. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with
 11.49 after public notice, as required by   11.28 and 11.29(b), effective October 14, 1980, and
become part of the type certification basis, as provided by  21.17(a)(2).Special conditions are proposed
for flight test demonstrations. These requirements would ensure that the parachute recovery system will perform
its intended function without exceeding its strength capabilities. These requirements would also require that
demonstrations be made to show that the parachute will deploy in various specified flight conditions.Special conditions
are proposed for the occupant restraint provisions where applicable. These requirements ensure that airplanes
modified with a parachute recovery system are equipped with a restraint system designed to protect the occupants
from injury during parachute deployment and ground impact.Special conditions are proposed for the parachute performance.
The requirements would ensure the following: (a) The parachute complies with the applicable section of TSO-C23c
(SAE AS8015A) at the critical airplane weights, (b) the parachute deployment loads do not exceed the structural strength
of the airplane, (c) the system will provide a ground impact that does not result in serious injury of the passengers,
and (d) the system will operate in adverse weather conditions.

Special conditions are proposed for the functions and operations of the parachute recovery system. These requirements
would ensure the following: (a) There is no fire hazard associated with the system, (b) the system has adequate reliability,
(c) the sequence of arming and activating the system will prevent inadvertent deployment, (d) the system can be activated
from either the pilot's or the copilot's position by various sized people, (e) the system will be labeled to show its
identification function and operating limitations, and (f) if must be shown that the occupants will be protected
from serious injury after touchdown under various adverse weather conditions, including high winds.
Special conditions are proposed for protection of the parachute recovery system. These requirements would ensure
that the system is protected from deterioration due to weathering, corrosion, abrasion, and other causes; and that
provisions are made to the parachute canister to provide adequate ventilation and drainage.
Special conditions are proposed for a system inspection provision. These requirements would ensure that adequate
means are available to permit examination of the parachute recovery system components and that instructions for
continued airworthiness are provided.
Special conditions are proposed for the operating limitations of the parachute recovery system. These requirements
would ensure that the system operating limitations are prescribed for inspecting, repacking, and replacing the
system's parachute and deployment mechanism at approved intervals.
The FAA has considered the features proposed by Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc., for the GARD installation in the
primary, normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes and has concluded that special conditions should be
proposed for such systems to provide the necessary level of safety.

Defense Logistics Agency Privacy Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Logistics Agency, DOD.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Defense Logistics Agency proposes to exempt an existing system of records, S255.01 DLA-GC, entitled Fraud and
Irregularities, from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The exemptions are intended to increase the value
of the system of records for law enforcement purposes, to comply with prohibitions against the disclosure of certain
kinds of information, and to protect the privacy of individuals identified in the system of records. The notice was
previously published on November 16, 1993, at 58 FR 60428.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12866

. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;
does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).






Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.







Paperwork Reduction Act. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that
the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974. 




This proposed rule would add two exemptions to an existing DLA system of records. DLA performs as one of its principal
functions investigations into and enforcement actions concerned with violations of civil and administrative law,
fraud, or antitrust rules relating to DLA procurement, property disposal, contract administration, or other DLA
activities. The proposal to add the (k)(2) and (k)(5) exemptions reflects recognition that certain records in the
system may be deemed to require protection from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned in
the files and avoid compromising, impeding, or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings. The
system would thus be exempt from sections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and
(f) as well as corresponding DLA and DoD Regulations. The Director proposes to adopt the exemptions for the above reasons.




List of subjects in 32 CFR part 323




Privacy.




Accordingly, the Defense Logistics Agency proposes to amend 32 CFR part 323 as follows:
1. The authority citation for 32 CFR part 323 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

Pub. L. 93-579, 88 Stat 1896 (5 U.S.C. 552a).




2. Appendix H to part 323 is amended by adding paragraph c.


* * * * *


Appendix H to Part 323-DLA Exemption Rules * * * 


c. ID: S100.50 DLA-GC (Specific exemption).




1. System name: 

Fraud and Irregularities.




2. 

Exemption: 

This system of records is exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G),
(H), and (I), and (f). 
3. 

Authorities: 

5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).
4. 

Reasons: 

From subsection (c)(3) because granting access to the accounting for each disclosure as required by the Privacy Act,
including the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure and the identity of the recipient, could alert the subject
to the existence of the investigation or prosecutive interest by DLA or other agencies. This could seriously compromise
case preparation by prematurely revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere with witnesses or make
witnesses reluctant to cooperate; and lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence. 
From subsections (d)(1) through (d)(4) and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and the
right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein would
seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. 
From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of each piece of information
in the early stages of an investigation. In some cases, it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other
evidence that its relevance and necessity will be clear. 
From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because there is no necessity for such publication since the system of records
will be exempt from the underlying duties to provide notification about and access to information in the system and
to make amendments to and corrections of the information in the system. 
From subsection (e)(4)(I) because to the extent that this provision is construed to require more detailed disclosure
than the broad, generic information currently published in the system notice, an exemption from this provision is
necessary to protect the confidentiality of sources of information and to protect privacy and physical safety of
witnesses and informants. DLA will, nevertheless, continue to publish such a notice in broad generic terms as is its
current practice.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY

: This proposed rule would establish management standards and guidelines for the protection and preservation of
historic, archeological, and paleontological resources; the use of motorized and mechanical equipment; the use
of motorized and nonmotorized rivercraft; and the degree and type of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing permissible
on National Forest System lands in the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. The intended effect is to ensure the
protection, preservation, and enjoyment of the Area as directed by statute.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Act of December 31, 1975 (the ``Act''), established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (the ``HCNRA'')
``to assure that the natural beauty, and historical and archeological values of the Hells Canyon area * * *
are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecologic values and public enjoyment
of the area are thereby enhanced.'' 89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg 

et seq.

 While the Act's overall thrust is to protect and enhance the identified resource values within the HCNRA, Congress
acknowledged in Section 13 of the Act that ``ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of
homes and lands associated therewith, as they exist on the date of enactment of this Act, are recognized as traditional
and valid uses of the recreation area.''
The HCNRA covers 658,457 acres. Almost 95% of the HCNRA, or 625,193 acres, is in federal ownership. Within the HCNRA
is the Hells Canyon Wilderness, totalling 219,500 acres of National Forest System land, and a small section of the
Eagle Cap Wilderness, totalling 3,553 acres of National Forest System land. Also within the HCNRA are the Snake, Rapid,
and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers, the corridors of which include 33,767 acres of National Forest System lands.
Section 7 of the Act stipulates that the HCNRA shall be administered for public outdoor recreation in a manner compatible
with the following objectives:
(1) The maintenance and protection of the free-flowing nature of the rivers within the recreation area;
(2) Conservation of scenic, wilderness, cultural, scientific, and other values contributing to the public benefit;
(3) Preservation, especially in the area generally known as Hells Canyon, of all features and peculiarities believed
to be biologically unique including, but not limited to, rare and endemic plant species, rare combinations of aquatic,
terrestrial, and atmospheric habitats, and the rare combinations of outstanding and diverse ecosystems and parts
of ecosystems associated therewith;
(4) Protection and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat;
(5) Protection of archeological and paleontological sites and interpretation of these sites for the public benefit
and knowledge insofar as it is compatible with protection;
(6) Preservation and restoration of historic sites associated with and typifying the economic and social history
of the region and the American West; and
(7) Such management, utilization, and disposal of natural resources on federally owned lands, including, but not
limited to, timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining, and grazing and the continuation of such existing uses
and developments as are compatible with the provisions of the Act.

Section 10 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to accomplish the purposes
of the Act. Section 10 expressly lists several subjects as possible topics for rulemaking, including the following:


(1) Standards and guidelines to insure the full protection and preservation of the historic, archeological, and
paleontological resources in the recreation area;

(2) Provision for the control of the use of the use of motorized and mechanical equipment for transportation over,
or alteration of, the surface of any Federal land within the recreation area;
(3) Provision for the control of the use and number of motorized and nonmotorized rivercraft: Provided, that the use
of such craft is hereby recognized as a valid use of the Snake River within the recreation area; and

(4) Standards for such management, utilization, and disposal of natural resources on federally owned lands, including,
but not limited to, timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining and grazing and the continuation of such existing
uses and developments as are compatible with the provisions of this Act.

Section 10 also authorized rulemaking to establish standards for the use and development of privately owned property
in the HCNRA. This is the subject of a separate rulemaking and, thus, is not included in this proposed rule.

Following enactment of the Act in 1975, the Forest Service construed Section 10's authority to promulgate regulations
as discretionary and that the issues identified therein could be adequately addressed under existing statutory
and regulatory authority. This interpretation was challenged in a 1988 lawsuit which contended that the regulatory
authority in Section 10 was mandatory, not discretionary. 

Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC)

 v. 

Lyng,

 slip op. No. 88-680PA (D. Or. 1989). The district court in Oregon 
rejected ONRC's argument that the Secretary had a non-discretionary duty to issue regulations under Section 10 and
dismissed the case. On appeal, however, the Ninth Circuit, reversed the district court and concluded that the regulations
were, in fact, required by Section 10. According to the Ninth Circuit, Section 10 ``compels the Secretary to promulgate
nonduplicative regulations of the sort described by subsections 10(a) through 10(e).'' 

ONRC 

v. 

Lyng,

 882 F.2d 1417, 1421 (9th Cir. 1989).

Within three months of the 9th Circuit's decision in 

ONRC 

v. 

Lyng,

 an interim rule establishing standards and guidelines for federal lands in the HCNRA had been adopted and public comment
solicited (54 FR 41089; Oct. 5, 1989). Only two comments were received on the interim rule. The interim rule has never
been published as a final rule. Due to the length of time that has passed since the issuance of the interim rule, and the
recognition that substantial modifications to the interim rule would be required, the agency has decided to issue
a new proposed rule for public comment. Accordingly, an agency response to the comments submitted on the 1989 interim
rule is not needed.

For ease of reference, the proposed rule divides the HCNRA into two categories_Wilderness Lands and Other Lands.
Consistent with Congress' recognition that the wilderness portions of the HCNRA should receive substantially more
protection than the rest of the HCNRA, some standards and guidelines are more protective in the Wilderness Lands category
than in the Other Lands category. In other instances, however, the standards and guidelines are the same.



Section-By-Section Explanation of the Proposed Rule



This proposed rule would established a new Subpart F of Part 292, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area_Public Lands,
in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A section-by-section explanation of the proposed rule follows:



Section 292.40 Purpose and Scope.



Paragraph (a) of proposed  292.40 explains that the purpose of this rule is to establish specific standards
and guidelines for the use of the National Forest System lands that comprise the Hells Canyon National Recreation
Area (HCNRA). The topics that are the subject of these standards and guidelines correspond with the topics in Section
10 of the Act, except for the use and development of privately owned property which, as previously noted, is the subject
of a separate rulemaking and not addressed herein. Paragraph (b) explains that, unless directly in conflict with
the standards and guidelines set forth in the rule, all of the existing authorities generally applicable to National
Forest System lands are specifically applicable to the National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. It also states that
the specific regulatory authority for the HCNRA embodied in the rule's standards and guidelines would prevail over
the Forest Service's general regulatory authority for National Forest System lands, if a conflict between the two
should arise.



Section 292.41 Definitions



Proposed  292.41 defines terms used in the proposed rule.



Section 292.42 Management Standards and Guidelines



Proposed  292.42 would establish several guiding principles that apply to the standards and guidelines called
for in Section 10 of the Act and set out in   292.43 through 292.48. These principles include the recognition
that the rule is a supplement to, not a substitute for, existing regulatory authority; that uses or activities authorized
under the rule's standards and guidelines might require additional site-specific environmental analysis; that
programmatic direction in the Comprehensive Management Plan must conform to the standards and guidelines of the
rule; and, that the standards and guidelines for a given use or activity may vary depending on whether that use or activity
is located inside or outside the designated wilderness in the HCNRA.



Section 292.43 Protection and Preservation of Cultural and Paleontological Resources



Proposed  292.43 would create seven standards to guide Forest Service administration of cultural and paleontological
resources in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a) (1)-(4) set forth the standards and guidelines for cultural
and paleontological resources on the Other Lands in the HCNRA; proposed paragraphs (b) (1)-(3) set forth the
standards and guidelines for cultural and paleontological resources located on the Wilderness Lands in the HCNRA.
For ease of reference, ``cultural resources'' includes historic and archeological resources in the HCNRA. Though
not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470 

et seq.,

 the Archeological Resources Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 470AA 

et seq.,

 and the Antiquities Act, 16 U.S.C. 431 

et seq.

 and the accompanying regulations at 36 CFR parts 296 and 800 would also apply.

<PARENT> FR940119-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (a)(1) would establish protection as the primary management objective for cultural resources in the HCNRA.
It would additionally provide for public education and information opportunities about cultural resources as a
management objective unless this would unreasonably interfere with protection efforts. This standard acknowledges
the importance of cultural resource protection and education for the vast storehouse of information in the HCNRA
but recognizes that educating the public about cultural resources must be secondary to protection and must occur
only if the resources can be adequately protected.

Proposed paragraph (a)(2) requires that the Ranger establish management priorities for cultural resources based,
in part, on whether the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office has concurred with the Forest Service's determination
that a cultural resource is ``significant.'' By establishing priorities, the Ranger will be able to allocate available
moneys for protection, education, and enjoyment based on the historical or scientific importance of a cultural resource.
The Ranger also may take into account the relative risk of damage or destruction to the resource and steps that could
be taken to avoid or minimize that risk.

Paragraph (a)(3) would apply to cultural resources which meet the significance threshold. It would require that
information from these resources be documented and favor on-site over off-site protection. The Ranger may select
off-site protection under certain conditions. For instance, the Ranger may decide off-site protection is appropriate
if the resource is located on NRA Wilderness Lands and protecting it on-site would significantly intrude on the wilderness
resource. Another example of when off-site protection might be preferred is if the cost is less than on-site protection
and significant cultural resources with identical or similar values have already been protected on-site.

Proposed paragraph (a)(4) applies to all paleontological resources in the HCNRA and would establish protection
for scientific study as the primary objective. Prior written authorization would be required before any individual
could disturb or remove a paleontological resource in connection with scientific study activities.

Paragraph (b)(1) would incorporate the standards and guidelines for Other Lands and apply them to the Wilderness
Lands. This would ensure consistency of Forest Service cultural and paleontological resource administration within
the HCNRA and, more importantly, the protection of these resources into the future.

Paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) would establish two additional standards for Wilderness Lands in recognition of the Agency's
dual management objectives of protecting cultural resources and minimizing impacts on the wilderness. This would
be accomplished by requiring that information and education activities related to cultural resources on Wilderness
Lands be conducted outside of the wilderness and by precluding the development of new or relocated trails on Wilderness
Lands which would be used primarily as a means of securing public access to cultural resources. This will enable visitors
to experience cultural resources in their natural setting, unencumbered by the signs, guided tours, or other devices
normally used to inform and educate the visitor about our past.



Section 292.44 The Use of Motorized and Mechanical Equipment



Proposed  292.44 would create five standards to guide Forest Service administration of motorized and mechanical
equipment on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)-(4) set forth the standards
and guidelines for motorized and mechanical equipment use in the Other Lands; proposed paragraph (b) would establish
the standard for such use in the Wilderness Lands. For ease of reference, the term ``motorized and mechanical equipment''
in this rule has the same meaning as ``motorized equipment'' and ``mechanical transport'' which are defined in regulations
promulgated under the Wilderness Act at 36 CFR part 293 except that it would not include motorized wheelchairs or other
devices used solely to assist people with disabilities. Nor would it include motorized or nonmotorized rivercraft
which are defined in and regulated under a separate provision of this rule. Though not explicitly referenced, the
relevant provisions of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131 

et seq.

, and regulations at 36 CFR parts 212, 261, 293, and 295 would also apply.

Paragraph (a)(1) would authorize the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on any Forest Service roads or airfields
within the HCNRA subject to terms and conditions necessary to ensure the safe use of these facilities. This provision
applies to all Forest Service transportation development facilities as that term is currently defined in 36 CFR 212.1,
except for Forest Service trails which are the subject of paragraph (a)(2). This provision also does not purport to
regulate the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on public roads or highways which are under the jurisdiction
of a state or local transportation authority.

Paragraph (a)(2) would authorize the use of motorized and mechanical equipment on Forest Service trails subject
to terms and conditions necessary to ensure the safe use of these facilities and when compatible with the management
objectives identified in section 7 of the Act. As envisioned in the proposed rule, motorized and mechanical equipment
could only be used on Forest Service trails in the non-wilderness portions of the HCNRA pursuant to a finding that such
use was compatible with, among other things, the protection of free-flowing rivers, the conservation of wilderness
and other values, the maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat, and/or the protection of historic, archeologic,
and paleontologic sites. If a particular proposed use was compatible with some of the management objectives but not
with others, the Ranger would have to decide whether, on balance, the compatibility outweighed the incompatibility
and the use could proceed.

Paragraph (a)(3) would authorize the use of mechanical equipment off National Forest airstrips, roads, or trails
only if such use is compatible with the management objectives of section 7 of the Act.

Paragraph (a)(4) would prohibit the use of motorized equipment off Forest Service airstrips, roads, and trails except
in those cases where it is reasonably necessary to attain one or more of the management objectives set out in section
7. Under this standard, use of an off-road vehicle (ORV) might only be permitted if it were necessary to protect fish
and wildlife habitat or preserve historic resources. ORV use also might be allowable if it were necessary to conduct
the types of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing that are provided for in the proposed rule. It will be the responsibility
of the proponent of such use to demonstrate its necessity related to the management objectives in section 7.

<DOCNO> FR940119-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940119-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These standards, when read together, establish a three-tiered system governing motorized and mechanical equipment
use in the non-wilderness portion of the HCNRA. The requirements by which use may be authorized become increasingly
rigorous depending on whether the proposed use is contemplated on Forest Service roads/airfields, Forest Service
trails, or off Forest Service airstrips, roads, or trails. This provision recognizes that off-road travel is generally
not tolerated within the HCNRA due to the fragile and difficult terrain, impacts to wildlife and their habitat, and
other issues associated with resource protection.

Proposed paragraph (b) explains that there are no non-duplicative regulations needed for managing motorized and
mechanical equipment in wilderness areas of the HCNRA since such use is already prohibited by the Wilderness Act.
Accordingly, the proposed rule would merely restate the exiting prohibition and provide cross-references to exceptions
permitted in the Wilderness Act.

The proposed rule would exempt from its coverage all uses related to Forest Service administration which might include,
at a minimum, research activities and public health and safety responses. It also would exclude uses necessary to
access privately owned lands or interests in land wholly within the HCNRA.



Section 292.45 Use of Motorized and Non-Motorized Rivercraft



Proposed  292.45 would establish seven standards to guide Forest Service administration of the use of motorized
and non-motorized rivercraft in the HCNRA. These standards and guidelines are only applicable to those rivers or
river segments that have been designated as components of the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Though not explicitly
referenced, the relevant provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271 

et seq.,

 and regulations at 36 CFR part 297, would also apply.

Paragraph (a) would authorize the use of non-motorized rivercraft on Wild and Scenic Rivers subject to such rules
and regulations the Ranger deems necessary to protect and enhance the values which caused the river to be designated
wild and scenic or to ensure the public's safe use and enjoyment of the river.

Paragraph (b) would prohibit the use of motorized rivercraft on all Wild and Scenic Rivers except for the Snake River.
This prohibition will not prevent the exercise of any type of currently authorized motorized rivercraft use in the
HCNRA; rather, it will simply provide for management of this use which is currently limited to the Snake River. It does,
however, effectively preclude expansion of motorized rivercraft use to other Wild and Scenic Rivers which will facilitate
the protection and enhancement of the values which caused those rivers to be designated.

Paragraph (c) would require that all authorized rivercraft use on Wild and Scenic Rivers in the HCNRA be in compliance
with State and/or Federal boating safety and registration laws.

Proposed paragraph (d) establishes a requirement that all users of motorized and non-motorized rivercraft on the
Snake Wild and Scenic River must receive prior written authorization for such use from the Ranger. It also explains
that such authorization may include terms and conditions on numbers, duration, seasons of use, noise, or other matters
that will protect and enhance the river resource and ensure a high quality river experience for users of all types.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940119-1-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940119-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraphs (e) and (f) are extensions of paragraph (d) and would require the Ranger, as part of the written authorization
process for the Snake Wild and Scenic River, to make sure that both private and commercial rivercraft users are reasonably
accommodated, and that the user capacity of the river is not exceeded, respectively. 

Finally, paragraph (g) would require the Ranger to identify and minimize to the extent practicable any existing or
potential conflicts between motorized and non-motorized rivercraft users or between rivercraft users in general
and other individuals like fishermen or researchers who may use or enjoy the Wild and Scenic Rivers in the HCNRA. 

These standards and guidelines have been narrowly tailored to address those specific types of rivercraft use on those
specific river segments where the greatest potential risk exists to the agency's ability to administer the HCNRA
in such a way as to protect and enhance its natural, cultural, recreational, fishery and other resource values. With
respect to the use of rivercraft, the greatest risk is currently presented by the use of motorized rivercraft on the
Snake Wild and Scenic River. As a result, most of the standards and guidelines in this section pertain to that use on
that river. Though the authority exists, it was deemed unnecessary to establish additional standards for other Wild
and Scenic Rivers or other rivers in the HCNRA at this time to address future contingencies which may or may not ultimately
materialize. 



Section 292.46 Timber Harvesting Activities



Proposed  292.46 would establish three standards to guide Forest Service administration of timber harvesting
activities on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)-(2) set forth the standards
and guidelines for timber harvesting activities in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA; proposed paragraph (b)
establishes the standard in the Wilderness Lands. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of
the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131 

et seq., 

and regulations at 36 CFR part 223, 261 and 293 would also apply. 

Paragraph (a)(1) would specify that timber will not be harvested solely for commercial gain but, rather, will be harvested
only in conjunction with other, non-commercial purposes including maintenance or improvement of ecosystem health,
wildlife habitat, or the recreational use and enjoyment of the HCNRA. Trees could also be removed to eliminate hazards
to persons or their property. Finally, timber harvesting could also be employed as an appropriate and measured response
to natural events including, but not limited to, fire, flood, and disease or pest infestation. The significance of
this provision is that it does not provide for timber production in and of itself to be an objective of the timber harvesting
activity. 

In those instances where one or more of the purposes for which timber may be harvested is recognized, paragraph (a)(2)
conditions the manner by which the timber may be harvested. These silvicultural prescriptions authorize timber
harvesting only by means of selective or intermediate cuttings. For the purpose of this proposed rule, the term ``selective
cutting'' means ``selection cutting'' as that term is defined by the Society of American Foresters. The Agency believes
that the Act, in discussing the permissible types of silvicultural prescriptions in the HCNRA, incorrectly used
the term ``selective cutting'' which is a type of exploitation cutting generally referred to as ``creaming'', ``culling'',
or ``high-grading''. For that reason, the Agency defined ``selective cutting'' as ``selection cutting'' which
is, in all likelihood, the term Congress intended to use in the Act and which means the annual or periodic removal of
trees individually or in small groups. The other types of authorized cuttings are well understood within the forestry
profession and are defined in the proposed rule as they appear in the book, 

Terminology of Forest Science Technology Practice and Products

, published by the Society of American Foresters. These types of cuttings represent the most ecologically sensitive
methods by which harvesting can be accomplished. Additional proposed restrictions on harvesting in this proposed
section include requirements that the smallest area and least number of clearings be created, and that the clearings
blend into the natural landscape to the extent practicable. These provisions would ensure that any timber harvesting
allowable within the HCNRA would proceed as unobtrusively as possible. 

Proposed paragraph (b) explains that there are no non-duplicative regulations needed for managing timber harvesting
activities in wilderness areas of the HCNRA since such use is already generally prohibited by the Wilderness Act.
Accordingly, it merely restates the existing prohibition and provides cross references to exceptions permitted
in the Wilderness Act. 



Section 292.47 Mining Activities



Proposed 292.47 would establish six standards to guide Forest Service administration of mining activities throughout
the entire HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)-(4) set forth the standards and guidelines for mining activities
in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA; proposed paragraphs (b)(1)-(2) establish the standards for the Wilderness
Lands category. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the 1872 Mining Law, 30 U.S.C. 22 

et seq.

, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. 181 

et seq.

, the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, 30 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131 

et seq.

, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271 

et seq.

, and regulations at 36 CFR parts 228 and 293 would also apply.

Paragraph (a) prohibits mining activities in the HCNRA subject to valid existing rights. This is a restatement of
Section 11 of the Act which withdrew all federal lands within the HCNRA from the operation of the mining and mineral
leasing laws subject to valid existing rights. Accordingly, the only authorized mining activities that may occur
in the HCNRA are those in which the valid existing rights have been established. Holders of mining claims and mineral
leases must demonstrate that they have valid existing rights before land disturbing activities can be initiated.
This requirement would also extend to what in common parlance has become known as ``recreational mining.'' There
is no authority for recreational mining other than the statutes cited in the preceding paragraph. Thus, even if an
operator claims that an activity involving the exploration and/or extraction of mineral resources is ``recreational''
in nature, that operator must prove that he or she has valid existing rights to conduct that activity under one of the
aforementioned statutes.

<DOCNO> FR940119-1-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940119-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (b) proposes that the impact of mining activities be directed away from the Wilderness Lands and Wild and
Scenic Rivers to the extent practicable. This would enable the impacts of developmental drilling operations and
the construction of access routes, among other things, to be concentrated on lands which may be better suited to such
uses or which may not possess the number or degree of resource values exhibited on Wilderness Lands or Wild and Scenic
Rivers.
Paragraphs (c) and (d) concern the extraction and use of mineral materials in the HCNRA. Mineral materials include,
but are not limited to, common varieties of sand, gravel, and stone and are governed by the Mineral Materials Act of
1947, 30 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, rather than the mining and mineral leasing laws. As a result, activities related to mineral materials are not subject
to the withdrawal of federal lands from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws in Section 11 of the Act.
These standards, in addition to the applicable provisions of Subpart C of 36 CFR part 228, specify the circumstances
under which exploration, extraction and use of common variety mineral materials may occur in the HCNRA. Paragraph
(c) would provide that mineral materials may only be used in the HCNRA for the purpose of constructing or maintaining
facilities such as roads, existing airfields, trails and other recreation developments.
Paragraph (d) would require that mineral materials needed for use in the HCNRA for one of the enumerated purposes in
paragraph (c) or for use outside the HCNRA on a project with specific and identifiable benefits for the HCNRA must come
from sources located outside the HCNRA unless (1) the cost associated with using non-HCNRA mineral materials adds
significantly to the costs of the material, or (2) the transportation of mineral materials from outside the HCNRA
presents a safety hazard to the motoring public.When mineral materials are obtained from inside the HCNRA, environmental
impact at the source must be mitigated by contouring the land, re-establishing vegetation, and other appropriate
measures. This paragraph would further prohibit the extraction of mineral materials from sources inside the HCNRA
if the use would be outside the HCNRA and would not directly benefit the HCNRA.
Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would incorporate the standards and guidelines in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) for Other
Lands and apply them to Wilderness Lands. This would ensure the consistency of Forest Service administration of mining
activities within the HCNRA and further the protection and enhancement of the values which caused Congress to designate
the HCNRA.
Paragraph (b)(2) would prohibit the extraction of mineral materials from the Wilderness Lands. This is a restatement
of existing authority in 36 CFR 293.14(c).
The effect of the foregoing standards is to provide for the continued maintenance and development of facilities and
transportation routes necessary for the administration and safe use and enjoyment of the HCNRA while at the same time
minimizing the impacts of such activities on HCNRA lands and directing such activities to non-HCNRA lands wherever
possible.


Section 292.48 Grazing Activities


Proposed  292.48 would create four standards to guide Forest Service administration of grazing activities
on National Forest System lands throughout the entire HCNRA. The agency felt that one set of standards and guidelines
for the entire HCNRA would be simpler to administer and would adequately provide for the continuation of grazing and
the protection and enhancement of the HCNRA resource values. Though not expressly referenced, the relevant provisions
of the Granger-Thye Act, 16 U.S.C. 580 

et seq.

, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, 43 U.S.C. 1701 

et seq.

, the Public Rangelands Improvement Act, 43 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq.

, and regulations at 36 CFR part 222 would also apply.
Paragraph (a) would authorize the grazing of domestic livestock only on National Forest rangeland that has been found
to be in satisfactory condition. In those situations where the land is suitable and in satisfactory conditions, livestock
grazing could only take place in such numbers, seasons, and methods which will ensure that the satisfactory condition
is maintained. This provision will ensure that domestic livestock grazing will not occur on rangelands that are currently
in substandard condition nor will it occur in such a way as to degrade rangelands that are currently in satisfactory
condition.
Proposed paragraph (b) requires the Forest Service to administer the grazing program to minimize or eliminate conflicts
between domestic livestock and fish and wildlife, outdoor recreation, and the preservation and conservation of
the other natural values for which the HCNRA was established by adjusting the level, type of livestock, or manner of
grazing. This paragraph further requires that the domestic livestock grazing must cease in the event that the adjustment
in the grazing activity has failed to eliminate the conflict. This ensures that grazing will not continue if it can
not be conducted in a manner that is compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established.

<DOCNO> FR940119-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940119-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (c) would require that range improvements constructed or implemented on National Forest System lands
must be as unobtrusive as possible while still accomplishing the purposes for which the improvement was required.
This could involve fences or water storage facilities being constructed in a visually inconspicuous fashion or the
use of vegetative treatments in an environmentally sensitive manner. 

Paragraph (d) would require that in administering the domestic livestock grazing program, measures must be instituted
to protect and conserve riparian areas. This could take the form of restrictions on place, time, or manner of livestock
grazing and would be in furtherance of protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat which is one of the management
objectives of the HCNRA.



Summary



The proposed rule establishes standards for National Forest System lands within the HCNRA to ensure that the activities
which occur on the National Forest System lands within the HCNRA are compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA
was created. The proposed regulations have been carefully drafted to include only those management standards and
guidelines which are nonduplicative.

Except in those instances in which there would be a direct and irreconcilable conflict, this proposed rule would not
supplant the Forest Service's existing regulatory authority related to National Forest System lands. This regulatory
authority covers a panoply of subjects including, but not limited to, range management (36 CFR part 222), timber (36
CFR part 223), minerals (36 CFR part 228), off-road vehicle use (36 CFR part 295), archeological resources (36 CFR
part 296), and historic and cultural properties (36 CFR part 800).

Nor would this proposed rule simply restate the current regulatory authority of the Forest Service to administer
the National Forest System lands. Instead, this proposed rule would augment existing regulatory authority to establish
standards and guidelines that would address the subject matter areas identified in section 10 that were of particular
concern to Congress when the HCNRA was established in 1975. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption
of a final rule.

In summary, these standards and guidelines will protect and preserve historic, archeologic, and paleontologic
resources; provide for the use of motorized and mechanical equipment; provide for the use of motorized and nonmotorized
rivercraft; and establish the permissible scope and extent of timber harvesting, mining, and grazing on National
Forest System lands in the HCNRA. In so doing, the Forest Service will be able to ensure that the natural beauty, historical,
and archeological values of the HCNRA are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and
ecological values and public enjoyment of the area are thereby enhanced.



Regulatory Impact



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 on ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' It has been determined
that this is not a significant rule.

This rule also has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, and it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities as defined by that act.



Environmental Impact



This proposed rule is promulgated in accordance with section 10 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 460gg-7. The affected environment
and consequences of implementing management alternatives for the HCNRA were analyzed and disclosed in the Environmental
Impact Statement for the Comprehensive Management Plan that was implemented by the Chief of the Forest Service on
May 23, 1981. The analysis completed for the Comprehensive Management Plan was revalidated in April 1990 with the
signing of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Record of Decision (page 1). A review
of this proposed rule indicates no potential for significant effect on the quality of the human environmental other
than that previously disclosed in the Environmental Impact Statement. The environmental consequences of any future
projects will be subject to site specific analysis pursuant to Forest Service National Environmental Policy Act
procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950, Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). Therefore, no additional environmental
documentation is deemed needed on this rule. Information pertaining to the environmental analysis may be obtained
by writing or calling the persons or offices listed under

Takings Implication



In compliance with Executive Order 12630 and the Attorney General's Guidelines for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance
of Unanticipated Takings, the takings implications of this proposed rule have been reviewed and considered. It has
been determined that there is no risk of a taking.



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform Act



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule were
adopted, (1) all state and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this proposed rule or which would impede
its full implementation would be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect would be given to this proposed rule; and (3)
it would not require administrative proceedings before parties could file suit in court challenging its provisions.



Paperwork Reduction



This rule will not result in additional paperwork not already approved for use. Therefore, the review provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320 do not apply.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Massachusetts; Amendment to Massachusetts' SIP
(for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide) for Transit Systems Improvements and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities in the
Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This revision provides for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Executive Office of Transportation and Construction
to construct and operate specified transit facilities and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes established therein.
Implementation of the defined transportation projects will help reduce the use of automobiles, provide for additional
transit facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Region, and improve traffic operations on the region's roadways,
resulting in improved air quality. This action should have a beneficial effect on air quality because it is intended
to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the Boston Metropolitan Area. The emissions to be reduced include hydrocarbons
(ground-level ozone precursors) and carbon monoxide (CO). 



This action is being taken under section 110(a) and (l) of the Clean Air Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 9, 1991, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP) submitted a revision to its
SIP for Transit Systems Improvements and HOV Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District.
This new regulation commits the Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation and Construction (MA EOTC) to
pursue implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of transit system improvements and HOV facilities that were
identified as transportation and air quality mitigation measures in a 1990 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement for the CA/THT project. EPA determined five of the proposed TCMs were necessary to help achieve an air quality
benefit from the CA/THT. This SIP amendment amends 310 CMR 7.00 by adding two new sections; 310 CMR 7.36-''Transit
System Improvements,'' and 310 CMR 7.37-''High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes.''
 


Background




The intent of the proposed regulation is to reduce concentrations of ground-level ozone by codifying commitments
from the MA EOTC to implement HOV and transit system improvements. These commitments were originally included as
part of a Metropolitan Planning Organization-approved Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): Traffic and Air Quality
Mitigation For the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project (CA/T) and were incorporated into Massachusetts
Air Pollution Control Regulations 310 CMR 7.00 through adding Section 7.36: Transit System Improvements; and Section
7.37: High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes. The regulations are designed to help reduce the use of automobiles, to provide
for additional transit facilities in the Metropolitan Boston region, and to improve traffic operations on the region's
roadways, resulting in improved air quality.
Reducing VMT eases traffic congestion and can lead to improved air quality. To the extent that reductions in regional
VMT improve traffic flow, a subsequent reduction in the sources of CO and volatile organic compounds (VOC) may be achieved.

Reducing VMT will also contribute to a direct and indirect reduction in air toxics. Emissions from gasoline-driven
engines contain air toxics, such as benzene, a known carcinogen. Many products of incomplete combustion, including
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo-a-pyrene, are emitted by gasoline and diesel engines and are associated
with chronic and acute health effects. Gasoline vapors released during transfer or pumping of fuel also contain benzene
and other air toxics. The health effects of air toxics are wide-ranging and can vary from long-term carcinogenic effects,
to short-term adverse health effects. 

The Massachusetts regulations are designed to support the Commonwealth's transportation control strategies and
future attempts to control VMT and ease traffic congestion in the metropolitan Boston Area. For example, the facilities
provided for in these regulations could support the development of employee trip-reduction programs by creating
alternatives to single-occupant vehicles.



Summary of Proposed Transit System Improvements



The Transit System Improvements regulation consists of seven subsections summarized as follows:




(1) Applicability: The transit system improvements regulation applies to MA EOTC.

(2) Transit System Improvement Projects: The following transit projects must be completed and available for public
use by these dates:

 

 By December 31, 1992-Lynn Central Square Station and Parking Garage, North Station high platforms and
high tracks, Lynn Transit Station Bus Terminal. 
 By December 31, 1994-South Station Bus Terminal, South Station Track Number 12, Ipswich Commuter Rail
Line extension to Newburyport. 
 By December 31, 1996-Old Colony Commuter Rail Line Extension, Framingham Commuter Rail Line Extension
to Worcester, 10,000 Park and Ride and Commuter Rail parking spaces outside of the Boston core. 
 By December 31, 1997-Green Line Arborway Restoration. 
 By December 31, 1998-Blue Line platform lengthening and modernization. 
 By December 31, 1999-10,000 Park and Ride and Commuter Rail Station Parking spaces outside of the Boston
core in addition to those completed by December 31, 1996. 
 By December 31, 2001-South Boston Piers Electric Bus Service. 
 By December 31, 2011-Green Line extension to Ball Square/Tufts University, Blue Line Connection from
Bowdoin Station to the Red Line at Charles Station. 




(3) Project Delays, Project Deadline Extensions; and
(4) Substitute Transit System Improvement Projects: As described above, section 7.36(2) of the regulation identifies
specific transit projects which must be completed by specific dates. In section 7.36(3) of the regulation, however,
it appears MA EOTC is authorized to send MA DEP a notice delaying the completion date for any project. If the date is delayed
for more than three years, the rule requires MA EOTC to propose a substitute transit improvement project under the
process contained in section 7.36(4). EPA is taking comments on the way the transit project regulation addresses
project delays and substitute projects. 

Under 7.36(4), MA EOTC may at any time, and pursuant to 7.36(3) must in the event of a delay of over 3 years, propose a substitute
transit project to MA DEP. MA EOTC may substitute a project if EOTC demonstrates to MA DEP that the project:



* * * achieves equal or greater emission reductions of nonmethane hydocarbons [sic] (NMHC), carbon monoxide (C0)
and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and would provide a greater improvement in air quality for CO and NOx in the area where the
required project was to have been implemented, in both the short and long term.



310 CMR 7.36(4)(a)(1). MA DEP must supply EPA with a copy of MA EOTC's petition for the substitute, any demonstration,
and MA DEP's action on the petition. However, EPA has no role in approving the project or reviewing it prior to MA DEP's
acceptance of the substitute. In addition, there is also no public notice provided for any decision to substitute
a project.




EPA has two concerns with these provisions. First, EPA and the public cannot rely on the completion dates listed in
7.36(2) as the final enforceable compliance dates for the transit projects. The rule allows MA EOTC and MA DEP to extend
those dates by at least 3 years.

Second, and more importantly, at the end of any 3 year delay or any time before that, MA DEP is authorized, without any
EPA concurrence or public comment, to substitute another transit project for those listed in the rule. MA DEP has imposed
on itself and MA EOTC a standard for reviewing substitute projects, quoted above, that essentially requires the new
project to provide air quality benefits equivalent to or better than the original project specified in the regulation.
But other than to limit substitute projects to ``transit improvement projects,'' the type of substitute project
is otherwise unconstrained by the regulation.

There are many types of transportation control measures that might reasonably be treated as substitute transit projects
under this rule, ranging from concrete capital investments such as different rail lines or special bus lanes to market-based
incentives such as mass transit fare subsidies or highway tolls.

1

 It is impossible for EPA to know what sort of substitute projects MA DEP might be evaluating in the future. Consequently,
it is also impossible for EPA to judge objectively the equivalency of any new project, since the MA DEP has not committed
to using EPA-approved methodology for determining air quality benefits. The regulation does not provide for any
specific quantification methodology that might allow EPA to assess the replicability of any air quality benefits
analysis MA DEP will conduct in evaluating a substitute project. Therefore, EPA cannot now calculate with acceptable
reliability the emissions reductions MA DEP, EPA, and the public will be able to enforce under this rule.





On the other hand, EPA believes that the kind of transit measures identified in this rule are directionally sound and
that any substitute project meeting the standard contained in the rule should contribute to achieving the air quality
standards for ozone and CO. Since under the current ozone and CO SIPs for this area, there are no specific measures to
promote transit projects, section 7.36 must necessarily contribute more emissions reductions toward attainment
than the existing SIP. So although EPA has concerns about the quantification of air quality benefits these rules will
achieve, EPA is prepared to approve them into the SIP.

2







To address EPA's concerns, however, the Agency proposes not to grant Massachusetts any credit for emissions reductions
from these measures in any reasonable further progress (RFP), attainment, or maintenance demonstration, unless
DEP submits a SIP revision making the requirement for the transit measure, or any substitute for that measure, federally
enforceable. Upon approval of the SIP revision including the transit measure, Massachusetts could take credit for
the measure, and the requirement to implement that measure would become an enforceable part of the SIP. EPA is proposing
this approach because without a SIP revision, DEP could substitute the specific transit enhancements in these rules
for another at any time. Given the inherent uncertainty in quantifying the emission impacts of potential substitution
measures, as described above, EPA and the public may be left without an adequate remedy under the DEP rule to assure
that the substitute project is in fact yielding equivalent emissions reductions. The SIP revision process gives
EPA and the public an opportunity to examine Massachusetts' proposed emissions reduction credits. If DEP asks for
credit for the measures specified in this proposed rule, approving an enforceable commitment of the Commonwealth
into the SIP should be a relatively simple matter. Where the SIP revision proposes a substitute project, EPA and the
public may need to examine whether the substitute in fact achieves equivalent reductions.

3







(5) Project Review and Consultation: MA EOTC must consult with the MA Highway (formerly MA Department of Public Works),
the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), EPA, and
MA DEP on a quarterly basis when planning, directing, constructing, or making transit system improvements.

(6) Transit System Improvement Studies: By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC must draft and issue for comment an initial study
of transit improvement strategies (in addition to those listed above), which will ultimately be incorporated into
a Program for Mass Transit (PMT). By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC must draft and issue for comment the following transit
system improvement studies: a toll pricing feasibility study to regulate single occupant vehicle trips to Logan
Airport; a study of the feasibility of relocating some of the existing Sumner Tunnel Toll booths to Route 1A; a water
shuttle service (for service between Boston and the North Shore) feasibility study; a study of transit system improvements
which could be made in addition to those specific improvements listed above also in 310 CMR 7.36(2); a study of the feasibility
of constructing a rail connection between South Station and Logan Airport; a study to expand the size and number of
suburban locations of Logan airport express service parking and transit facilities; a study to expand the HOV lanes
and services within the boundaries of Logan Airport. By December 31, 1994, MA EOTC must draft and issue for comment
a study of transit system improvements including: connecting circumferential transit facilities and radial transit
services; improving travel times and upgrading rail service to New York City NY, Worcester MA, Springfield MA, Hartford
CT and Portland ME; and indexing transit fares to maximize the use of transit. Each study identified above would include
a technical feasibility analysis, estimates of time and costs associated with implementing the measures, and the
air quality impacts of the measure. Final reports for studies in this subsection, containing recommendations and
schedule for further action, must be released by March 30 of the year following the deadline of the study.
 
(7) Record Keeping and Reporting: By March 1st of each year, MA EOTC must submit a progress report to the MA DEP on the
status of each transit project/study in the regulation. The report must contain expected impacts on transit ridership
system-wide. The report will be distributed to members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and other
interested parties. EPA wishes to identify itself as an interested party at this time and requests that copies of the
reports be forwarded to the EPA Regional Office.



Summary of Proposed High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities



The High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes regulation consists of eleven subsections summarized as follows:




(1) Applicability: The regulation applies to MA EOTC and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA).

(2) HOV Lanes: By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC shall extend the I-93 Southbound HOV lane (north of the southern bank
of the Charles River) toward Route 128 to the northernmost point appropriate. Additionally, the final design of the
Charles River crossing on the southbound side of I-93 extending down to the exit ramp to Nashua Street shall include
an HOV lane on the southbound side of I-93. Furthermore, by May 31, 1993, MA EOTC shall construct and make available
HOV lanes northbound and southbound on I-93 beginning at the intersection of I-93 with I-90 and extending
to a point immediately north of the intersection of I-93 and Route 3 if the threshold standards described below
are violated for three consecutive months. 
(3) Establishment of Roadway Threshold Standards: By October 1, 1991, MA EOTC shall develop roadway threshold standards
that represent a significant increase in traffic volume above baseline roadway conditions and that can trigger construction
of an HOV lane. Roadway threshold standards shall be calculated to represent an average weekday peak-hour trip time
increase of 35 percent from baseline roadway conditions. By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC must document, maintain, and
submit such conditions to the MA DEP for I-93 north- and south-bound between I-90 and Rte. 3 in Braintree;
and I-93 north-bound between the Charles River crossing and I-95 (Route 128). By December 31, 1991, MTA
must establish roadway threshold standards for I-90 east- and west-bound between I-93 and I-95
(Route 128). By December 31, 1993, MA EOTC and the MTA shall each collect such information as is necessary to identify
and document baseline roadway conditions for all these roadway segments.

(4) Feasibility Studies: Before December 31, 1992, MA EOTC shall study the feasibility of HOV lanes for the road segments
for which threshold standards are set under subsection (3) above. The study shall assess the impact of HOV lanes on
emissions, general purpose traffic, and engineering issues.

(5) Additional HOV Facilities: Roadway Threshold Standards: Beginning on January 1, 1992, MA EOTC and the MTA must
monitor roadway segments listed in (3) above on a monthly basis to ensure that average trip times do not exceed roadway
threshold standards. If the roadway threshold standards are exceeded for any three-month consecutive period, MA
EOTC is required to notify MA DEP and to implement certain HOV measures.

MA EOTC's notice to MA DEP will include a schedule for implementing an HOV lane on the road segment violating the roadway
threshold standards.

4

 There is no requirement limiting the time by which an HOV lane must be implemented. However, the addition of HOV lanes
on I-93 in either direction between I-90 and Route 3 and on I-90 in either direction between I-93
and I-95 must be found to be feasible in the study to be conducted under subsection 4, above. As discussed below,
if an HOV lane is determined to be infeasible on a roadway where threshold standards are exceeded, MA EOTC can propose
a substitute project.





(6) HOV Performance Standards: Performance standards are defined as the range of roadway performance between Level
of Service B and a condition of under-utilization. Within 30 days of implementation of an HOV facility, MA EOTC and
MTA must submit performance standards for each HOV facility or HOV lane under their respective jurisdiction.

(7) Continuous Attainment of Performance Standards: Beginning on January 1, 1991, MA EOTC and MTA must monitor HOV
performance- measuring trip times quarterly. Measurements must be taken on 5-7 weekdays over two consecutive
weeks within each quarter. A minimum of three time runs must be made in each direction for each HOV roadway segment on
each sample day. MA EOTC and MTA must take all appropriate measures to maintain compliance with the performance standards,
including increasing the number of occupants required to be eligible for the HOV lane. If the performance standards
are exceeded for each time run, MA EOTC must report the exceedance to the MA DEP within 10 days of the end of the month in
which the exceedance took place, including measures necessary to return the roadway or facility to compliance.

(8) Substitute High Occupancy Vehicle Projects: If the feasibility studies provided for in subsection (4) demonstrate
that an HOV lane is infeasible, MA EOTC can substitute an alternative project by petitioning MA DEP. The petition must:



 
* * * include a demonstration that the alternative project achieves equal or greater emission reductions of NMHC,
CO, and NOx and would provide a greater improvement in air quality for CO and Nox [sic] in the areas where the required
high occupancy vehicle lane was targeted, both short- and long-term. 





310 CMR 7.37(8)(a)(1). The MA DEP is then authorized to substitute an alternative project. Similar to the substitution
process for transit projects outlined above, EPA must receive a copy of MA EOTC's petition and demonstrations, and
MA DEP's petition, determination, and supporting documentation; but EPA has no role in reviewing or approving the
substitute before approval by MA DEP. 


For the same reasons described above, EPA is prepared to approve 310 CMR 7.37 into the SIP as a directionally sound measure,
but not to grant any credit in RFP, attainment, or maintenance demonstrations until the Commonwealth irrevocably
commits to specific HOV facilities or substitute measures in a SIP revision. It appears that the first HOV segment,
on I-93 southbound, is largely completed. Beyond that segment, however, the rule allows MA DEP to substitute
alternative projects for future HOV lanes without any EPA or public scrutiny of the substitute project.

(9) HOV Studies and Further Actions: MA EOTC must take steps to enhance and expand Massachusetts Turnpike Authority
HOV facilities including the following: a study to improve air quality and HOV flow between Rte. 128 and Boston and
to examine full-scale HOV lanes and mechanisms; and a program of HOV toll booths with demarcated lanes, privileges,
and provisions of electronic ID systems to facilitate HOV flow through toll booths.

By December 31, 1992 MA EOTC shall in consultation with MA Highway and MTA submit a study to the MA DEP that defines the
feasibility of establishing HOV lanes and HOV incentives for these highways: I-93 northbound and southbound
between I-90 and Route 3 in Braintree; I-93 northbound between the Charles River Crossing and I-95;
and I-90 eastbound and westbound between I-93 and I-95.

(10) HOV Promotion and Enforcement: By December 31, 1991, MA EOTC and MTA must submit an enforcement program and plan
to the MA DEP. By April 1, 1992 MA EOTC and MTA shall submit a program to promote HOV use. 
(11) HOV Expansion to the Local Roadway Network: MA EOTC shall encourage the City of Boston to incorporate HOV facilities
into the construction and reconstruction of city streets, and shall work with the Massachusetts Port Authority to
study HOV needs at Logan Airport.



Air Quality Impacts



As discussed above, EPA believes that the mass transit and HOV facilities promoted by these regulations support air
quality goals and assist in the maintenance of projected air quality emissions. EPA's review of this material indicates
that the implementation and operation of the mass transit and HOV facilities will result in improved air quality,
by reducing vehicle trips, providing increased public transit services, and reducing the number of single occupant
motor vehicles. Reducing VMT will also ease traffic congestion. EPA is therefore proposing to approve the Massachusetts
SIP revision for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide, for Transit Systems Improvements and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District, which was submitted on December 10, 1991.

EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments
will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the EPA regional office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this document.
 


Proposed Action


EPA is proposing to approve the SIP amendment for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide, for Transit Systems Improvements
and High Occupancy Vehicle Facilities in the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District.

Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709.) SIP approvals (or redesignations) do not create any new requirements but
simply approve requirements that are already State law. SIP approvals (or redesignations), therefore, do not add
any additional requirements for small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under
the Clean Air Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute Federal inquiry into
the economic reasonableness of the state actions. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
this waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order
12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP will be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements
of
sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K) and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.

Alachlor; Proposed Revocation of Certain Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to revoke certain tolerances for residues of the herbicide alachlor and its metabolites in
or on various raw agricultural commodities. EPA is initiating this action because registered uses of alachlor on
certain food commodities have been canceled.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document proposes the revocation of tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the herbicide alachlor (2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-

N

-(methoxymethyl)acetanilide) and its metabolites in or on the following raw agricultural commodities listed in
40 CFR 180.249: Cotton forage, cottonseed, sunflower seed, pea forage, pea hay, peas with the pods removed, and potatoes.


By March 1988, the product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended, for the pesticide products containing the herbicide alachlor were canceled for the above-mentioned
raw agricultural commodities. Based on the fact that alachlor is no longer domestically registered for use on these
food crops and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for the particular
food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.249 for residues of alachlor in or on these commodities.
Since the product registrations were canceled more than 5 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated,
domestically produced commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.

The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances because sufficient
time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate, and EPA does not expect a residue problem due to environmental
contamination.
EPA requests that interested persons submit information pertaining to whether these products are used in foreign
countries and may be present in commodities grown in those countries and imported to the U.S.
Within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under FIFRA which contains
alachlor may request that this rulemaking proposal to revoke the tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee
in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300315]. All written comments filed in response to this document will
be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, between 8 a.m.
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 

Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed regulatory action has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94
Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations.
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner. 
Since all registrations for use of alachlor on these food crops were canceled more than 5 years ago, it is anticipated
that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances were revoked.
Accordingly, I certify that this proposed regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility
analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Demeton; Proposed Revocation of Tolerances and Feed Additive Regulations 




Agency:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the revocation of tolerances and feed additive regulations listed in 40 CFR 180.105 and 40
CFR 186.1600 for residues of the insecticide demeton in or on various raw agricultural commodities and in animal feeds.
EPA is initiating this action because all registered uses of demeton have been canceled. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document proposes the revocation of tolerances and feed additive regulations established under sections 408
and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a and 348, respectively, for residues of the
insecticide demeton (a mixture of 

O,O

-diethyl 

O

 (and 

S

)-2-(ethylthio)ethylphosphorothioates) in or on raw agricultural commodities and animal feeds. EPA is initiating
this action because all registered uses of this chemical on raw agricultural commodities have been canceled. 


By mid-October 1989, all product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
for pesticide products containing the insecticide demeton were canceled. Based on the fact that demeton is no longer
domestically registered for use on any food crops, and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical
which is not registered for the particular food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances and feed additive regulations
for residues of demeton as listed 40 CFR 180.105 and 40 CFR 186.1600. Since the product registrations were canceled
more than 3 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated, domestically produced commodities. These
tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.
1. 

Section 180.105.

 EPA is proposing to revoke the following tolerances for residues of the insecticide demeton in or on the following
commodities: 12 parts per million in or on alfalfa hay, clover hay; 5 parts per million in or on almond hulls, barley
(green fodder and straw), fresh alfalfa, fresh clover, oats (green fodder and straw), sugar beet tops, and wheat (green
fodder and straw); 1.25 parts per million in or on grapes, hops; 0.75 part per million in or on almonds, apples, apricots,
barley grain, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cottonseed, filberts, grapefruit, lemons,
lettuce, muskmelons, nectarines, oat grain, oranges, peaches, pears, peas, pecans, peppers, plums (fresh prunes),
potatoes, strawberries, tomatoes, walnuts, wheat grain; 0.5 part per million in or on sugar beets; 0.3 part per million
in or on beans, eggplants; 0.2 part per million in or on sorghum grain, sorghum forage.
2. 

Section 186.1600

. EPA is proposing to revoke a tolerance of 5 parts per million for residues of demeton in dehydrated sugar beet pulp
for livestock feed.
The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances and feed additive regulations
because sufficient time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate and does not anticipate a residue problem
due to environmental contamination.
EPA has no information at this time to suggest that demeton is used on food commodities exported to the U.S. Therefore,
EPA is requesting that interested persons submit information pertaining to whether these products are used in foreign
countries and may be present in commodities grown in those countries and imported to the U.S. 
Within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains demeton may request that this rulemaking proposal as
it pertains to section 408 tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300316]. All written comments filed in response to this document will
be available in the Public Information Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In 1991, the Department issued a report on emergency flow restricting devices (EFRDs) that proposed seeking public
input on the placement of EFRDs at certain locations on hazardous liquid pipelines. The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992
mandated that the Department issue regulations prescribing the circumstances under which operators must use EFRDs
and other equipment used to detect and locate pipeline ruptures on hazardous liquid pipelines. The regulations are
to be issued following a survey and assessment of the effectiveness of such equipment. This advance notice of proposed
rulemaking (ANPRM) poses a series of questions in order to solicit public input for the survey process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background


The RSPA has been concerned for some time with the issue of more rapid leak detection on hazardous liquid pipelines,
and the optimum placement of EFRDs to limit commodity release after the location of the release in the hazardous liquid
pipeline has been identified.
Section 203 of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act (codified at 49 U.S.C. app.  2002(n)) as amended by the
Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the 1992 Act) (Pub. L. 102-508) mandated the Secretary, within two years of enactment,
to conduct a survey and assess the effectiveness of emergency flow restricting devices (EFRDs) and other procedures,
systems, and equipment used to detect and locate hazardous liquid pipeline ruptures and minimize product releases
from hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. The 1992 amendments further mandated that the Secretary issue regulations
within two years of completion of the survey and assessment. These regulations would prescribe the circumstances
under which operators of hazardous liquid pipelines would use EFRDs and other procedures, systems, and equipment
to detect and locate pipeline ruptures and minimize product release from pipeline facilities. The Secretary has
delegated this authority to the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) (See 49 CFR 1.53).
Also, the Department's March 1991 report titled ``Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study'' contained proposals
that we seek public input on the placement of EFRDs in urban areas, at water crossings, at other critical areas affected
by commodity release, and areas in close proximity to the public outside of urban areas.
This ANPRM solicits public input for the survey process mandated by the 1992 Act as well as the proposals from the Department's
1991 EFRD study. The ANPRM requests information and data by posing a series of questions. This approach is utilized
rather than conducting a traditional research survey of a selected number of respondents in order to obtain a broader
base of data and to accelerate the regulatory process.


Notice on Highly Volatile Liquids_1978


In 1978, the RSPA issued an NPRM (43 FR 39402; September 5, 1978) proposing requirements intended to limit spillage
from hazardous liquid pipelines carrying highly volatile liquids (HVL)

1

 in inhabited areas by requiring installation of remotely controlled valves (RCVs)

2

 or automatically controlled valves (ACVs).

3

 This proposal was later withdrawn (46 FR 2130; January 8, 1981) because hazardous liquid pipeline industry studies
demonstrated that placement of closely spaced valves over the full length of an HVL pipeline was not a reasonable method
of reducing the effects of an accident.






Mounds View Accident


A July 8, 1986, accident on a gasoline pipeline focused interest on EFRDs. The accident, caused by a ruptured pipe seam
on a gasoline pipeline in Mounds View, Minnesota, resulted in two deaths, one injury, and property damage well in excess
of $1,000,000. The accident was exacerbated by backflow or draining from the pipeline after the manually operated
valves on either side of the ruptured section were closed. The spill ignited approximately 20 minutes after the rupture.
It took the pipeline operator over 1 hour and 40 minutes from the time of the rupture to isolate the ruptured section.
Since this accident, the pipeline company installed a computerized leak-detection system and RCVs on either side
of Mounds View (a distance of about 5.7 miles).


Advance Notice on Certain Safety Proposals_1987


In 1987, as a result of the same accident, the RSPA again addressed RCVs and ACVs in an ANPRM (52 FR 4361; February 11,
1987). This ANPRM invited public comment on the merit of certain safety proposals advanced by Congress, the Minnesota
Commission on Pipeline Safety, and the National Transportation Safety Board. One safety proposal was to convert
shutoff valves required by the pipeline safety regulations on existing pipelines to RCVs or ACVs, and require similar
valves on new pipeline construction.

<PARENT> FR940119-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Both gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators indicated that neither RCVs nor ACVs were installed as shutoff valves
as standard practice. They indicated that RCVs and ACVs had little effect to mitigate the extent of the spill because
often, especially in populated areas on gas pipelines, ignition occurred before either type of valve could shut down
a pipeline. 
The specific concern of false closure of ACVs was identified in these comments. There was substantial agreement by
both gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators that ACVs should not be used as EFRDs because of their unreliability.
This unreliability was due to the inability of ACV sensors to distinguish between a leak and normal operating fluctuations.
Pipeline operators indicated numerous documented cases of unintended closures of ACVs. A false closure of an ACV
on a hazardous liquid pipeline can cause an immediate pressure buildup or surge which may result in a pipeline rupture.

On September 23, 1987, the ANPRM was discussed at the joint meeting of the RSPA's Technical Pipeline Safety Standards
Committee and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee. (Both technical committees
were established by the Secretary of Transportation to advise the Department on the technical feasibility, reasonableness,
and practicability of all proposed gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety standards and all amendments to existing
standards.) The committees recommended that the Department study the selective use of RCVs and ACVs. 


Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study_1991 


Section 305 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-561), enacted on October 31,
1988, directed a study of the safety, cost, feasibility, and effectiveness of requiring gas and hazardous liquid
pipeline operators to install EFRDs in existing and future pipeline systems in varying circumstances and locations.

In March 1991, in response to this Congressional mandate, the Department issued the study titled ``Emergency Flow
Restricting Devices Study.'' One of the conclusions in the study was that RCVs and check valves

4

 are the only feasible EFRDs. Another conclusion was that requiring the retrofitting of all existing manually operated
valves to RCVs on hazardous liquid pipelines in urban locations, as well as new valves in urban areas appeared to be
cost effective. Still another conclusion in the study was that for an RCV to be effective, a modern supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) system with a well-designed leak detection subsystem was necessary to reduce spills
from hazardous liquid pipelines. The study found that there was no significant benefit from installing EFRDs on gas
transmission pipelines. 




SCADA systems utilize computer technology to analyze data (e.g., pressure, temperature, and delivery flow rates)
that are continuously gathered from remote locations on the pipeline. Computer analysis of this data is used to assist
in day-to-day operating decisions on the pipeline and to provide input for real-time models of the pipeline operation
which can identify and locate leaks. 
SCADA-based leak detection subsystems are composed of hardware and software programs that employ a real-time modelling
procedure to compare the current operational conditions of a segment of pipe to an ``ideal'' operating state. This
ideal state is sometimes recalibrated during operations to accommodate variations in conditions (e.g., temperature
or pressure fluctuations in the pipe that occur due to changes in the materials in transport or external environmental
conditions). An ``alarm'' is sent to a central operator when the software model detects a condition that is ``substantially''
different from the idealized state. What makes the condition ``substantially'' different, thereby triggering
the alarm, is determined by the model designer and the conditions imposed on the model, as well as by the amount of data
available on the ``ideal'' state and its normal operational variability. 
An RCV can operate without a SCADA system installed. However, for an RCV to be used effectively in reducing a spill,
the dispatcher must be able to determine that a pipeline failure has occurred, identify the location of the failure,
and then quickly initiate closure of the valve. Accomplishing these actions in a timely manner requires the installation
of a SCADA system including a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The extensive pollution which resulted from
a 1988 pipeline failure in Maries County, Missouri, to be discussed later in this ANPRM, might have been avoided if
a leak detection subsystem had been installed with the SCADA system allowing operator personnel to detect the leak.

It is clear from the RSPA's analysis of information and data obtained in conducting the March 1991 EFRD study, that
spillage from a pipeline failure can be significantly reduced by RCVs only where a modern SCADA system is equipped
with a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The type and sophistication of the control system, installed as part
of an existing SCADA system, depends on the age of the control system. 
The March 1991 EFRD study contained a number of proposals to address the issue of EFRDs. One of the proposals was that
the Department conduct a research study on whether SCADA systems, including well-designed leak detection subsystems,
should be required on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to enhance the safe operation of the pipelines. Enhanced
safety requirements would include provision for more rapid response following accidents, including valve spacing
criteria and initiating the closure of RCVs. This study is presently being conducted by the Volpe National Transportation
System Center (VNTSC) and is discussed later in this ANPRM. 
Another proposal from this study was for the RSPA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to require, on
hazardous liquid pipelines with SCADA systems installed, that existing manually operated main line block valves

5

 in urban areas be retrofitted to make them RCVs and install RCVs when new valves are installed in urban areas. This ANPRM
seeks data on valves located in urban areas. 




Other proposals in the study suggested public input on whether the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations
in 49 CFR part 195 should be revised to require valve spacing criteria for EFRDs at the following locations: (1) Where
the valves could most effectively reduce the likelihood of the escaping liquid entering the water at water crossings
that are more than 100-feet wide, and on either side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption; (2) At other
critical areas affected by commodity release; and (3) At specific locations outside of urban areas on hazardous liquid
pipelines in proximity to the public. 

Some of the questions posed in this ANPRM are designed to provide data on which the RSPA will decide on a further course
of action concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs in these locations. 


Past Data Collection 


To broaden the data base for the March 1991 EFRD study, the RSPA solicited information from the public, including gas
and hazardous liquid pipeline operators and equipment manufacturers, through a 

Federal Register

 notice (54 FR 20945; May 15, 1989). A series of 15 questions addressed a number of EFRD/leak detection-related issues
including SCADA technology, establishing a maximum allowable spill value, and criteria for valve spacing. The 72
responses to the notice are contained in Docket PS-104; Notice 1 and are available for review in the Docket Unit,
room 8421. 
The notice included a series of questions about leak detection subsystems which are part of operators' SCADA systems.
The responses to the questions indicated SCADA systems are becoming more sophisticated and leak detection subsystems
are becoming more common on hazardous liquid pipelines. The sensitivity of leak detection subsystems on hazardous
liquid pipelines was reported to range from 0.5 percent of flow to 5 percent of flow over a 1- to 2-hour period. Once a
leak is suspected, the time for the dispatcher to respond by closing valves ranges from a few minutes for an RCV to an
average of about 2 hours for manually operated valves. 

Commenters to the notice were also asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a valve spacing
requirement based on a maximum spill criterion. Two advantages cited by commenters to support establishing a maximum
spill criterion on a hazardous liquid pipeline were: (1) Reduction in the exposure to the public of the possible hazard
created by a spill and (2) improved contingency plans since the plans could be based on a spill of a set volume. However,
commenters cited more disadvantages than advantages.

Most hazardous liquid pipeline operators opposed setting a maximum spill criterion. They indicated a maximum acceptable
spill would vary widely along the length of any pipeline depending on spill location. Establishing one criterion
for all pipelines would not account for the variables at each spill location. Commenters indicated that more important
than establishing an arbitrary spill limit is the need to consider the line profile, drainage gradient, length, and
diameter of the hazardous liquid pipeline, susceptibility to outside force damage, population density, and potential
hazards to public safety and the environment. Commenters indicated a spill limit would require more valves, particularly
on large diameter hazardous liquid pipelines. This would increase the opportunity for inadvertent valve closure,
leakage from the valve itself, and vandalism. One commenter stated that protection of the public and environment
is related more to exposure of the hazardous liquid pipeline to the public and response time in detecting and responding
to a failure, than to setting a limit on the volume of product released. This commenter stated: ``The most effective
means for mitigating potential pipeline failure hazards is prompt leak identification, rapid pipeline shutdown,
and immediate dispatch of response crews to the failure site.'' 

Commenters were asked if the spacing of RCVs and ACVs is determined by a maximum spill from the hazardous liquid pipeline,
what should that maximum spill value be? None of the commenters provided a maximum spill value. Hazardous liquid pipeline
operators reiterated that the information provided in the responses to the valve spacing question should be used
in the context of spill mitigation rather than to establish a single maximum spill criterion. One commenter stated
that, in addition to pipe diameter, terrain, and the pipeline's route near or in urban areas, the RSPA should consider
the probability of failure, magnitude of the leak, and consequences of the leak in establishing a maximum spill criterion.




December 24, 1988, Failure in Maries County, Missouri



The legislative history for the 1992 Act cites a December 24, 1988, failure in Maries County, Missouri to demonstrate
the need of adequate leak detection equipment. The failure resulted in a crude oil spill of approximately 20,554 barrels
(863,268 gallons). The cause was the abrupt change in pressure and fluid flow from the switching of flowing, low density
crude oil from one pipeline into another containing a substantially heavier oil. 

Crude oil released entered a tributary of the Gasconade River, the Gasconade River, the Missouri River, and eventually
the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri. In order to control the contamination from the large volume of crude
oil released, it was necessary to shut down several water companies along these rivers and a brewery in St. Louis. 

Failure of pipeline personnel at the dispatching station to recognize that a rupture had occurred and to shut down
the pipeline greatly increased the volume of crude oil spilled. 

The Gasconade River and its tributary, into which the crude oil spill first entered, were bracketed by manually operated
block valves. The RSPA estimates that the installation of a check valve would have prevented drainage from the 5 mile
of pipe on either side of the river, thereby substantially reducing the size of the spill. Also, the installation of
a leak detection subsystem on the SCADA system would probably have substantially reduced the size of the spill.

Report From the National Institute of Standards and Technology 



The legislative history of the 1992 Act also cites a July 1989 report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce (Report Number NISTIR 89-4136) which resulted from an investigation of
the Maries County, Missouri pipeline failure. In the report, titled ``An Assessment of the Performance of Older ERW
Pipelines'', NIST found that the installation of EFRDs could significantly reduce the damage from pipeline failures
and recommended that they be installed in ``critical risk locations.'' 



Current SCADA Study by the VNTSC 



In May 1992, the RSPA commenced a research study with the VNTSC to analyze SCADA systems and computer-generated leak
detection systems. The purpose of the research study is to determine the feasibility and costs of requiring pipeline
operators to install a SCADA system including a leak detection subsystem, and determine what impediments exist or
what system improvements are needed to minimize the time it takes SCADA systems to detect and locate leaks, and make
recommendations to resolve these difficulties. As mentioned previously, this new initiative is based on findings
from the Department's March 1991 EFRD study concerning RCVs. These valves maximize the value of SCADA-based leak
detection systems by helping to mitigate damages from detected leaks. 

The first phase of this study included a literature search on the subject, on-site interviews with seven pipeline
operators, interviews with five equipment vendors, and development of a mathematical model describing optimal
valve spacing for given annual pipeline failure rates per mile and costs, and a method to evaluate alternative leak
detection system performance characteristics to reduce pipeline spill volumes. 

Every pipeline operator surveyed by the contractor used some sort of SCADA system. Most operators had at least one
computerized leak detection system, either one purchased from a vendor, custom designed by the operator, or a combination
of the two systems. All operators interviewed believed that the condition of high false alarm rates was a major drawback
to the installation and operation of leak detection systems. The problem occurs due to the required trade-off between
the threshold volume sensitivity of the leak detection system and the resulting false alarm rate when this sensitivity
is too high. All the operators interviewed emphasized that the most critical link in leak detection was the interface
between the system itself and the pipeline dispatcher, and that there was no substitute for a highly competent pipeline
dispatcher. 

The VNTSC is drafting a report on the first phase of the study. Once the report is completed, a copy will be placed in the
docket to this rulemaking.

D. Paperwork Reduction Act 


There are no new information collection requirements in this ANPRM. 


Questions 


The RSPA is issuing this ANPRM to solicit data from the public through a series of questions as the means of conducting
the survey mandated in the 1992 Act. The response from the public to these questions will aid in developing proposals
on what circumstances and criteria operators must install EFRDs and other equipment to limit product release from
hazardous liquid pipelines. The failures discussed above suggest that releases can be reduced when EFRDs and well-designed
leak detection systems are installed on hazardous liquid pipelines. 
Assessing the data received from the questions in the ANPRM should accelerate the rulemaking process required by
the 1992 Act. The data gathered by this ANPRM, the findings from earlier reports on the subject of EFRDs, including
the Department's March 1991 EFRD study, and the work accomplished so far in the SCADA contract with the VNTSC could
form the basis for any notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs and criteria for leak
detection systems. 
The RSPA is considering a systems approach to reducing spills from hazardous liquid pipelines. The system involved
includes equipment, personnel, software and procedures to accomplish three tasks: (1) Detect that a failure and
resultant spill has occurred; (2) Identify the location of the spill; and (3) Shut the pipeline down in order to reduce
the amount of the spill. The first two tasks involve computerized leak detection systems, while the third task involves
the installation of EFRDs. 
Many of the following questions are directed to the operators of hazardous liquid pipelines. They relate to pipeline
system operational data in addition to the physical location of pipeline facilities in relation to geographical
and topographical features which can only be obtained from pipeline operators. However, the RSPA solicits comments
to questions which do not involve data on a particular hazardous liquid pipeline from other members of the public including
State agencies, trade associations, and environmental organizations, both private and public. The RSPA believes
that State pipeline safety agencies can contribute significantly to this rulemaking because of the States' unique
experience with regulating intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines and as the Department's agent on interstate hazardous
liquid pipelines. Questions 18 and 19 are directed to the nonregulated public. These commenters are requested also
to suggest additional questions, including clarification questions, which may emerge from reviewing this ANPRM.

To aid in analysis of the responses, commenters are requested to respond using the same numbering system which is used
in this ANPRM. 



SCADA-based Leak Detection System Sensitivity and Reliability 


The RSPA needs data on which to base decisions on what should be proposed for SCADA-based leak detection systems. The
RSPA is starting from the premise that most if not all hazardous liquid pipeline operators have installed a SCADA system
which is used for the everyday efficient operation of the pipeline. The SCADA study by the VNTSC has, so far, found this
to be true. (Commenters are requested to indicate if this premise is true.) The RSPA must decide whether to propose:
(1) A specific type of leak detection system; (2) whether to propose requiring certain criteria which would embody
the attributes of all of the presently recognized computerized leak detection systems; (3) a combination of (1) and
(2); or (4) some other leak detection system requirement which at present is unknown to the RSPA but which may emerge
from comments to this ANPRM. 
The questions are intended to obtain responses which relate to operational data that a hazardous liquid operator
has concerning the SCADA-based leak detection system installed on its pipeline system including the sensitivity
and reliability of that system. 
Questions 1 through 6 primarily relate to the experience on a segment of the operator's hazardous liquid pipeline
system which is covered by a SCADA-based leak detection system. If the operator has segments of its hazardous liquid
pipeline system covered by more than one SCADA-based leak detection system, please submit responses to the series
of questions 1 through 6 for each segment of the covered pipeline system. For instance, a SCADA-based leak detection
system may be installed on a 400 mile segment of an interstate pipeline in Texas and another SCADA-based leak detection
system on a 200 mile segment in Virginia. The RSPA requests a separate set of responses for each segment, not aggregate
responses for all of the SCADA-based leak detection systems for all parts of the operator's pipeline system. 

Several topics will be addressed in the set of questions below. These are: (1) The method(s) of leak detection in use
on the segment described in the data submission; (2) leak detection alarms which occur at the hazardous liquid pipeline
systems operating center; (3) the leak detection and SCADA system availability; and (4) the actual performance of
leak detection systems in identifying and locating leaks on an operational hazardous liquid pipeline. 
If the operator does not presently have this data, we encourage the operator to gather the data for at least one month
and then submit it to the RSPA. System alarms history should be provided to the RSPA as a log and may be submitted either
as a computer printout or on a diskette using standard ASCII format as long as the segment identifying information
is clearly noted on the data. Experimental (or simulation-based) data may be provided as well as operational data
which only reflect actual operational experience.

The leak detection performance data should be provided as a log and may be submitted either as a computer printout or
on a diskette using standard ASCII format. Historical performance data gathered during developmental phases such
as system installation and modification also should be submitted. 
It would be helpful if commenters group data for each different data collection time period or pipeline segment, so
that all data (questions 1-6) relates to only one specific segment and time period. For the purposes of these
questions, a pipeline segment is defined as that part of the pipeline between two points where the product can be contained,
such as between two pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and a terminal, between a pressure pump
station and a valve, or between two valves.

Placement of EFRDs at water crossings, locations affected by commodity release, and rural areas where the public
is in proximity 


The request for information notice, documented in the Department's March 1991 EFRD study, asked ``Where should RCVs
and ACVs be placed and why?'' The response provided a number of specific locations, e.g., locations where possible
ground movement might occur, and densely populated locations, such as near a school or hospital, near an office building
or factory, or near a shopping center. River crossings were also specified by some commenters. Although conventional
wisdom would seem to suggest installing RCVs at these locations, the RSPA presently has no data which supports requiring
the installation of EFRDs at these locations. The number of these locations is unknown, but one of the following questions
will solicit data on the number of such areas which might be affected by a pipeline release.

<TEXT>
 

Likewise, the number of failures which have resulted in water pollution is unknown because the Department does not
require the occurrence of pollution to be identified on the hazardous liquid pipeline accident report. However,
the RSPA knows from research for developing the interim final rule for onshore oil pipeline response plans (58 FR 244,
January 5, 1993) under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Public Law No. 101-380, 104 Stat. 484, (OPA 90) that of the
approximately 2,700 oil pipeline spills reported each year to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about
half affect water. The accident effects which would be reduced by the installation of EFRDs are related more to pollution
than safety. Once the hazardous liquid mixes with water, the likelihood of a fire or explosion is reduced considerably.
Two of the following questions address the issue of water pollution as a result of pipeline failures. 

The accidents which occurred in Mounds View, Minnesota and Maries County, Missouri demonstrate that an assessment
by the RSPA should be conducted concerning the installation of EFRDs at specific locations along hazardous liquid
pipelines where the pipelines are in proximity to the public in rural areas, bodies of water (particularly bodies
of water containing drinking water intakes), and other critical locations affected by commodity release. This position
is supported by the NIST report (discussed above) which recommended installation of EFRDs in critical risk locations
to significantly limit the extent of damage if a failure occurs. Critical risk locations are defined in the NIST report
as locations where the risk to public safety, property, and the environment is great. 

The RSPA is also asking questions to gather data regarding locations where valves are presently required by the regulations
to protect bodies of water (49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f)). The regulations in 49 CFR 195.260 currently require valves
to be placed at locations along a hazardous liquid pipeline that will minimize damage or pollution from accidental
discharges
 (Section 195.260 (c)), on either side of a water crossing that is more than 100-feet wide (Section 195.260(e)), and
on either side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption (Section 195.260(f)). The American Petroleum Institute
has indicated that most of these main line block valves are manually operated. The current regulations do not require
that they be EFRDs. The financial impact on the regulated industry, if the RSPA were to require the installation of
RCVs, is unknown so cost data will be obtained through responses to questions set forth below. 





These questions apply only to hazardous liquid pipelines with leak detection systems since the March 1991 EFRD study
concluded RCVs are only effective where leak detection systems are installed. In addition, the questions address
valve spacing, particularly whether EFRDs should be installed at other critical locations. Such critical locations
would be identified during the rulemaking process after a review of data on water pollution from hazardous liquid
pipeline spills collected by agencies, such as the EPA, and as a result of the RSPA implementation of OPA 90. Placement
of a check valve on one side of a location and an RCV on the other side could reduce the number of valves that would require
remote control capability. 

The location of valves would be proposed, as a result of this assessment, only to effectively reduce the amount of liquid
entering a body of water depending on the terrain, and would not necessarily be immediately located on either side
of the water crossing. For instance, valves placed immediately on either side of a water crossing would be effective
in reducing pollution only if the failure was in the water crossing, a rare occurrence according to anecdotal evidence.
Valves would only be effective in locations where the hazardous liquid pipeline operator has a SCADA-based leak detection
system so that each RCV can be closed soon after a failure is detected.

Valves Installed Per 49 CFR 195.260 (e) & (f) 



As stated previously, 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f) require valves to be placed on hazardous liquid pipelines in order
to protect water.
 The March 1991 EFRD study proposed that the RSPA obtain public comment on whether the valves at these locations should
be EFRDs. The next series of questions are posed to obtain data to make that decision.

Valves in Urban Areas 


The March 1991 EFRD study concluded that it was feasible from a benefit to cost standpoint to retrofit existing manually
operated block valves on hazardous liquid pipelines located in urban areas to RCVs and to install RCVs when installing
new valves in urban areas. An urban area is one which is not a rural area

15

. A proposal to require RCVs in urban areas would apply to hazardous liquid pipelines which have installed leak detection
systems, as the Department found in the March 1991 study that RCVs are effective only where leak detection systems
are installed. 




The RSPA wants to establish a data base on manually operated block valves located on hazardous liquid pipelines in
urban areas to validate the conclusions made in the March 1991 study. 
Hazardous liquid pipeline operators are requested to respond to Questions 15-17 for pipelines in their systems
which are located in urban areas and on which a leak detection system is installed: 





Question 15:

 For your pipeline system, report the number of manually operated block valves that are installed in urban areas. Report

Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Lighting Devices, Reflectors, and Electrical Equipment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM); request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document announces that the FHWA is considering proposing measures for reducing the incidence and severity
of collisions with large trailers during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility. Specifically, the agency
is considering issuing a proposal to establish requirements for the use of retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors
for certain trailers manufactured prior to December 1, 1993, the effective date of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's final rule on conspicuity for newly manufactured trailers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



On December 10, 1992, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a final rule (49 CFR 571.108)
requiring that trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993, which have an overall width of 80 inches or more
and a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds, be equipped on the sides and rear with means for
making them more visible on the road.

1

 Trailers manufactured exclusively for use as offices or dwellings are exempt.





Trailer manufacturers may install either retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors. Manufacturers of retroreflective
sheeting or reflectors are required to certify compliance of their product with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
(FMVSS) No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108) whether the product is for use as original or as replacement equipment.



NHTSA Rulemaking



The NHTSA first requested comments concerning the use of reflective material to make heavy vehicles more visible
on May 27, 1980 (45 FR 35405). Forty-two comments were received, most of which favored the concept.

Between 1980 and 1985, the NHTSA conducted a fleet study in which retroreflective material was placed on van-trailer
combinations in a manner designed to increase their conspicuity during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility.
The treatment of trailers consisted of outlining the rear perimeter, and delineating the lower side. No reflectorized
mud flaps were used. The study concluded that truck-trailer combinations equipped with this material were involved
in 15 percent fewer crashes (in which a trailer was struck in the side or rear) than combinations lacking the material.
A copy of the report, ``Improved Commercial Vehicle Conspicuity and Signalling Systems_Task III Field Test Evaluation
of Vehicle Reflectorization Effectiveness,'' September 1985 (DOT HS 806 923) is included in the docket.

On September 18, 1987 (52 FR 35345), the NHTSA published a notice of request for comments. The notice presented results
of NHTSA's fleet study and sought comments on the test results as well as experiences motor carriers may have had with
the use of reflective material to enhance conspicuity. Thirty-seven comments were received, most agreeing that
a 15 percent reduction in accidents could be expected when all large vehicles were so equipped with reflective material.

As part of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990 (sec. 15, Pub. L. 101-500, 104 Stat. 1218), the Congress included
a provision directing the Secretary of Transportation ``to initiate a rulemaking proceeding on the need to adopt
methods for making trucks or any category of trucks more visible to motorists * * *'' not later than
February 3, 1991, and to complete the rulemaking proceeding not later than November 3, 1992. On December 4, 1991, the
NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 63474. The NHTSA regarded its NPRM as responsive to
the congressional mandate and the final rule as the completion of the rulemaking.

Prior to the issuance of the final rule, the NHTSA published the results of additional research on heavy vehicle conspicuity.
The purpose of the research program was to define a range of minimally acceptable large vehicle conspicuity enhancements
that could be used as a basis for revised Federal regulations. A number of laboratory and field studies were carried
out to assess the value of using a pattern in the marking material, the form the pattern should take, the placement of
the treatment on the trailer, the effect of retroreflective markings on the detection and identification of stop
and turn signals, and the trade-off between the width and retroreflective intensity of the treatment material. In
addition, field surveys were conducted to assess the effect of environmental dirt on the performance of the marking
systems and the durability of retroreflective materials when used on trucks.

<DOCNO> FR940119-1-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940119-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The results of the research support the red and white pattern, retroreflective intensity and width of materials in
NHTSA's final rule. With regard to durability, the study indicated on page 166 that:




The typical service life of a trailer is estimated at 14 years. It would be desirable that retroreflective treatments
provide adequate performance for at least that long. The limited data collected * * * indicate that
it is possible to use retroreflective materials in a trucking environment and suffer very little, if any loss in performance
for ten or more 
years * * *. Until more definitive data are available, it is recommended that performance loss due
to aging be established at 80 percent retention over the fourteen-year period. 



Relationship Between FHWA and NHTSA Requirements for Lamps and Reflective Devices 



The NHTSA is responsible for establishing manufacturing standards for motor vehicles. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and certain motor vehicle equipment must certify that their products meet all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standards (FMVSSs). The standards for lamps and reflective devices are contained under FMVSS No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108).


The FHWA is responsible for establishing standards for commercial motor vehicles used in interstate commerce. Commercial
motor vehicles subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations must meet the requirements of 49 CFR Parts
393 (Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation) and 396 (Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance). Generally,
part 393 does not establish vehicle or equipment manufacturing standards per se, but rather establishes requirements
for certain equipment necessary for the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. The requirements for lamps
and reflective devices are contained under   393.11 through 393.26. 

The requirements in   393.11 through 393.26 are generally consistent with the manufacturing standards
in FMVSS No. 108. Manufacturers are required to equip newly manufactured commercial motor vehicles in accordance
with FMVSS No. 108. Commercial motor vehicles subject to the FMCSRs must be equipped with lamps and reflective devices
as required under part 393. 



Current FMCSRs Requirement for Conspicuity Treatment 



Section 393.11 requires that all lighting devices on motor vehicles placed in operation after March 7, 1989, meet
the requirements of FMVSS No. 108 in effect at the time the vehicle is manufactured. Therefore, trailers manufactured
on or after December 1, 1993, the effective date of the FMVSS No. 108 requirement for retroreflective tape or reflex
reflectors, must have such reflective devices of the type and in the locations specified in FMVSS No. 108. 



Request for Comments 



The FHWA specifically requests comments that address the application of conspicuity requirements to trailers manufactured
before December 1, 1993. In a separate rulemaking, the FHWA will discuss maintenance and testing of conspicuity treatments
on trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993. The FHWA made a distinction between the two categories of vehicles
because the technical and economic issues associated with the consideration of retrofitting trailers with the conspicuity
treatment are much more complex than those associated with a requirement that motor carriers maintain the conspicuity
treatment with which the trailer was originally equipped. 

The FHWA requests that commenters address the specific issues below. However, the FHWA encourages commenters to
include a discussion of any other issues that the commenters believe are relevant to this rulemaking. 

1. Many motor carriers have been using retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors which are not of the colors,
retroreflective intensity, width, or configuration of the conspicuity treatment in the NHTSA's final rule. The
FHWA seeks information on the type of conspicuity treatments in use and quantitative data on the cost and effectiveness
of those treatments in preventing and/or mitigating accidents. 

2. What types of technical problems (e.g., tape not adhering to the surface of the trailer) have motor carriers encountered
when applying conspicuity materials to in-service trailers? Are any problems unique to certain types of trailers,
or to certain types of paints, coatings, or surfaces? 

3. What is the approximate cost (parts and labor) to apply conspicuity treatments to trailers? Is special training
required for employees performing this task? What cost differences may exist between having this task performed
by the motor carrier's own maintenance department or by third parties?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940119-1-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940119-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. How long must a trailer be taken out of service to have the conspicuity material applied to its surfaces? 
5. With regard to conspicuity treatments that differ from those in the NHTSA final rule, a retrofitting requirement
could result in many motor carriers having to replace their current conspicuity treatments with one that is consistent
with the requirements of FMVSS No. 108. The FHWA believes that some form of conspicuity treatment (even certain forms
which may be less effective than that covered in the NHTSA's final rule) is better than no conspicuity treatment. What
different types of conspicuity treatment are currently being used by motor carriers? What results have been experienced
by motor carriers using conspicuity treatments? 
6. If this rulemaking proceeds, should the FHWA propose requiring the same red/white color combination, retroreflective
intensity, width and configuration as the NHTSA's final rule, or should alternative requirements be considered?
If alternatives are considered, do commenters foresee problems in the enforcement of a retrofitting requirement?

7. If this rulemaking proceeds, should the FHWA consider an effective date which is several (2, 3, 4, or 5) years after
the date of publication of the final rule? 


Rulemaking Analysis and Notices 


All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered
and will be available for examination in the docket room at the above address. Comments received after the comment
closing date will be filed in the docket and will be considered to the extent practicable. In addition to late comments,
the FHWA will also continue to file in the docket relevant information that becomes available after the comment closing
date, and interested persons should continue to examine the docket for new material. 


Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. Due
to the preliminary nature of this document and lack of necessary information on costs, the FHWA is unable to evaluate
the economic impact of the potential regulatory changes being considered in this rulemaking. Based on the information
received in response to this notice, the FHWA intends to carefully consider the costs and benefits associated with
various alternative requirements. Comments, information, and data are solicited on the economic impact of the potential
changes. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Due to the preliminary nature of this document and lack of necessary information on costs, the FHWA is unable to evaluate
the effects of the potential regulatory changes on small entities. Based on the information received in response
to this notice, the FHWA intends, in compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354; 5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq.

), to carefully consider the economic impacts of these potential changes on small entities. The FHWA solicits comments,
information, and data on these impacts. 


Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) issues this proposed rule governing the Atlantic bluefin tuna (bluefin) fisheries
to: Establish fishing category quota allocations for the 1994 fishing season; amend the specified amount of other
species to be landed as a condition for landing an incidental bycatch of bluefin in the southern longline fishery;
adjust the line that separates the northern and southern regulatory areas for vessels using longline gear and possessing
an Incidental Catch permit for bluefin; make technical corrections to clarify the regulatory text; and request comments
on the use of curved length measurements to identify bluefin size classes and on additional means to provide notice
of fishery closures. This action is necessary to implement the recently adopted quota recommendation of the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to improve management and monitoring of the U.S. bluefin
fisheries, to facilitate enforcement, and to enhance collection of data to improve assessment of the impacts of the
fisheries.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The bluefin fisheries are managed under the implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 285, under the authority of the
Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. The ATCA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
to promulgate regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations of ICCAT. The authority to implement
ICCAT recommendations is delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA).



Purpose of Current Action 



The proposed action for the 1994 fishing season is limited in scope. It is intended to meet existing obligations to
implement ICCAT recommendations and to improve the efficiency of the domestic fishery management program. 

Pursuant to ATCA requirements, action is currently needed to ensure that the 1994 ICCAT-recommended quota of 1,235
metric tons (mt) is not exceeded. Also, action is needed to adjust management measures for the 1994 fishery to improve
monitoring of bluefin tuna catch and facilitate enforcement. In addition, the proposed measures would enhance NMFS'
ability to meet the stated management objectives for the domestic fishery: provide data to monitor the stock, minimize
economic displacement, maximize the use of the resource, and spread fishing opportunity among as many users as possible.




Proposed Management Measures 



This proposed rule would implement the ICCAT quota recommendation for 1994 and allocate the total quota among the
several permitted fishing categories. In addition, NMFS received input regarding proposed changes to the Incidental
Catch category from 13 scoping meetings held during September 13-17, 1993, and from written comments received
during the comment period that ended November 5, 1993. Commenters suggested various proposals, some of which were
adopted in the proposed measures and others that may be considered for future rulemaking. NMFS considered all comments
received during the scoping process while formulating this proposed rule. NMFS believes that these proposed changes
would further the management objectives for the domestic bluefin fisheries. NMFS also requests comments on the use
of curved length measurements to identify bluefin size classes and on additional means to provide notice of fishery
closures. 



Fishing Category Quota Allocations for 1994 



At the November 8-12, 1993, meeting, ICCAT adopted a recommendation for new quotas for bluefin in the western
Atlantic. The total catch for the western Atlantic region for 1994 would be reduced by approximately 15 percent from
the 1992/1993 annual level to 1,995 mt. Despite this overall quota reduction, U.S. fishermen have been allocated
nearly the same amount of bluefin in 1994 (1,235 mt) as they were allocated in 1993 (1,248 mt). This results from Japan's
agreement to reduce its share of the total western Atlantic quota from its historical 26 percent to 12.5 percent during
1994 and 1995.

NMFS proposes to take the 13-mt reduction in the U.S. quota from the 31 mt reserve, thereby continuing or slightly modifying
the 1992/1993 quota allocations. The following quota allocations would be established for 1994: General category_531
mt; Harpoon Boat category_53 mt; Purse Seine category_301 mt; Incidental Catch category_southern longline subcategory
quota of 86 mt, northern longline subcategory quota of 23 mt, and ``other'' subcategory quota of 4 mt; Angling category_219
mt (no more than 99 mt of this quota may be school bluefin of which 47 mt may be landed south of 38
 47
' N. latitude and 52 mt may be landed north of 38
 47
' N. latitude). The Angling category quota for school bluefin is reduced from 100 mt to 99 mt because it is based,
per ICCAT recommendation, on 8 percent of the total U.S. quota (including reserve), which is lower for 1994. 

Also at the November 1993 meeting, ICCAT recommended a quota of 1,200 mt for the western Atlantic for 1995 (of which
U.S. fishermen would receive 743 mt). This reduction of over 50 percent from the 1991 western Atlantic quota is based
upon scientific assessments that indicate that present harvest levels are resulting in a decrease in the size of the
western Atlantic bluefin stock. The relatively higher 1994 allocation resulted from a 1-year provision to allow
additional time for scientific research, a review of data and methodologies used in the western Atlantic bluefin
stock assessment, and to reduce the short-term economic impact on fishermen. As a member of ICCAT, the United States
is obligated to adopt domestic regulations to comply with these recommendations. This proposed rule would establish
quota allocations by fishing categories for 1994 only. The quota reduction for 1995, being of greater magnitude and
likely to have significant impacts on the human environment, will be addressed in future rulemaking, which will include
preparation and public review of an environmental impact statement. 



Change in Bycatch Conditions for Southern Longline Subcategory 



In 1982, ICCAT recommended a ban on a directed bluefin tuna fishery in the Gulf of Mexico spawning area out of concern
for protection of the spawning stock. NMFS examination of available longline fishery data regarding discarded bluefin
in the Gulf of Mexico revealed that more than 80 percent of those bluefin released were dead. Thus, in the interest of
reducing waste, NMFS allowed landing of bluefin tuna but implemented longline fishery restrictions to preclude
directed harvest. 

In a final rule dated January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8012), NMFS implemented an incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin
per trip in the area south of 36
  N. latitude and 2 percent by weight of all other fish on board per trip in the area north of that latitude. The reason
for the disparity in the catch limits between the two regions was that the 2 percent by weight limit was believed to be
unenforceable in southern ports due to the lack of weighing facilities in many areas where bluefin were landed. On
January 6, 1992 (57 FR 365), NMFS determined that the incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin per trip in the southern
area was not effective at reducing bluefin bycatch and changed the restriction for this area to one bluefin per trip,
provided the vessel landed, offloaded, and sold at least 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) of other species. NMFS believed that
the majority of trips directed at other species met or exceeded the threshold, making accurate weighing unnecessary
in most cases. 

NMFS has received several comments indicating that the current bycatch restriction in the southern area is causing
an increase in bluefin discard and waste. Fishermen have reported that when a bluefin is caught early in a trip, they
are forced to continue fishing at the risk of deteriorating quality and price and at the risk of having to discard additional
bluefin in order to meet the target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Examination of 1993 domestic observer
data indicates that of 15 bluefin caught during observed trips, only four were retained (27 percent). Thus, reducing
the target catch requirement could lead to a reduction in bluefin mortality. 

NMFS examined several options, none of which would change the allocation for the total longline bycatch. The options
that were discussed at the scoping meetings were: (1) Require special gear; (2) set a requirement of a minimum number
of days between a vessel's landings; and (3) revise the minimum target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Recommendations
also included prohibiting bluefin catches in the spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico or, conversely, to work through
ICCAT to rescind the prohibition and establish a limited directed fishery. 

Special gear restrictions, such as breakaway leaders and circle hooks, are a management option, but further study
is required to define exact specifications and enforcement methods. NMFS considered setting a minimum number of
days between allowable landing of a bluefin by individual vessels but rejected this option because it could foster
a periodic directed fishery for bluefin while not necessarily eliminating the problems of bluefin bycatch on longline
trips directed at yellowfin tuna, swordfish, or sharks. NMFS also considered prohibiting the landing of bluefin
by longliners during the spawning season in the Gulf of Mexico but rejected this option because it would have precluded
retention of unavoidable bycatch that in many cases could not be released alive. NMFS also rejected a limited directed
fishery, which would be inconsistent with the ICCAT recommendation. Given the depleted status of the bluefin resource
and the significance of the Gulf of Mexico spawning grounds, NMFS does not consider a directed fishery to be warranted
at this time. 

NMFS believes that requiring threshold amounts to be landed ensures that bluefin are harvested only as bycatch incidental
to fishing for other species. NMFS examined landings of Gulf of Mexico longline trips where no bluefin were taken to
determine if the current target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) is appropriate. The data indicate that for
years 1989 through 1991, the median values of landings for trips where no bluefin were sold were slightly above 1,500
lbs (680 kg) for the months of January through April, and about 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg) for the months of May through December.
Therefore, NMFS proposes to amend the minimum poundage requirement so that for the southern management area for the
Incidental Catch category one bluefin tuna may be landed per vessel per fishing trip, provided that for the months
of January through April at least 1,500 lbs (680 kg) and for the months of May through December at least 3,500 lbs (1,588
kg), either dressed or round weight, of species other than Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, and
offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout as sold. This change should reduce waste and mortality
of bluefin tuna, while preserving the quality and value of legitimate bluefin bycatch that is landed.

NMFS believes it is possible to conduct directed fishing on species other than bluefin, with only a limited amount
of bluefin bycatch. However, if evidence indicates this is not true, NMFS may consider more stringent measures, such
as area or season closures or gear restrictions, in future rulemaking. 



Adjust the Longline Incidental Catch Boundary Line 



NMFS proposes to move the 36
 N. latitude line that separates the northern and southern longline fisheries to 34
 N. latitude. Several comments were received requesting such a change. A traditional longline fishing area
off Cape Hatteras straddles the current line at 36
 N. latitude. The current boundary, which is a very dynamic oceanographic regime, creates a problem because
of the uncertainty of drifts in the cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies and currents that occur in the area. Fishermen
may take bluefin in an open area and drift to a closed area, whereupon they are not able to land these fish because of the
prohibition on capture, retention, possession, and offloading of bluefin when an area is closed to fishing. NMFS
believes adjustment of the boundary line to 34
 N. latitude is appropriate because this a less dynamic oceanographic environment close to shore with the Florida
Current located further offshore. This modification should reduce waste of fish and enforcement problems in this
area without increasing bluefin mortality. The total bluefin quotas for the northern and southern management areas
for incidental longline catch would remain unchanged by this adjustment. 



Request for Comments Regarding the Use of Curved Length Measurements of Bluefin 



NMFS proposes to amend the regulations to include definitions of straight fork length, and curved fork length and
to clarify that straight length is the sole criterion for determination of bluefin tuna size class. Additionally,
NMFS proposes to amend the regulatory text regarding dealer reporting to clarify the existing requirements to report
weights and lengths of bluefin tuna purchased from fishermen. 

Currently, the size classes for bluefin are based on straight lengths (lengths taken along a straight line between
lines perpendicular to the body). If proper equipment is used, straight length provides a more accurate measurement
for bluefin than curved length (lengths taken along the curvature of the body) because of short-term variations in
the girth of the fish as a result of recent feeding rates. Frequently, however, calipers or similar instruments are
not available for measuring the straight length of bluefin. Measurements are often reported as curved length taken
with a tape measure held along the body of the fish. Illegal fish may be retained when commercial fishermen and recreational
anglers use curved length instead of straight length for determination of size classes and enforcement actions have
resulted. 

NMFS is not proposing to define size classes in terms of curved length at this time. However, after analysis of length
data is completed, NMFS could amend the size-class definitions to make curved length an acceptable criterion for
determination of bluefin tuna size class. NMFS requests comments on the use of curved length in conjunction with,
or in place of, straight length for determining size classes of bluefin. 



Request for Comments Regarding Additional Means To Provide Notice of Fishery Closures 



Under current regulations, closures are announced via notice in the 

Federal Register

, with the closures generally effective some time after filing the notice. Fishermen who do not have access to these
notices may consult NMFS weekly catch reports, consult notices issued over the highly migratory species fax network,
listen for updates on NOAA weather radio, or call 301-713-2347 or 508-281-9260 for current
information. NMFS received comments during the 1993 fishing season that sufficient notice was not provided for all
closures. While existing regulations do not require advance notice of closure, NMFS recognizes the importance of
making every effort to notify the affected public as far in advance as possible. 

Although NMFS endeavors to provide advance notice, quota monitoring is difficult when allowable catch levels are
small relative to the level of fishing effort. Based on current and historical catch rates, NMFS attempts to project
when quotas are likely to be reached for all fishing categories. While the overriding concern is to maintain catch
within each category's quota, it is also important that NMFS afford the maximum economic benefits to be gained from
full use of allocated quotas. Unfortunately, reliance on projected catch figures may result in premature closures
or short notification periods. Given the increasingly restrictive bluefin quotas in years 1995 and beyond, NMFS
anticipates that quota monitoring and notification of closures will become even more difficult. NMFS requests comments
on alternative means to provide notice of closures so as to minimize disruption to fishing activities and allow participants
to plan accordingly.

Technical Changes to the Regulations 



NMFS proposes two revisions to correct and clarify the regulatory text and to improve the effectiveness of management.
A technical revision to the regulatory text is proposed to omit obsolete references contained in  285.31(a)(30).
Also, NMFS proposes to specify in  285.31(a)(37) that, in order to retain fish less than 70 inches, vessels must
have an Angling category permit or must have taken the small bluefin pursuant to the incidental catch allowance of
the Purse Seine category fishery. This change is needed due to the implementation of the Angling category permit promulgated
in a prior rulemaking dated August 27, 1993 (58 FR 45286). 



Classification 



This proposed rule is published under the authority of the ATCA, 16 U.S.C. 971 

et seq.

 The AA has preliminarily determined that this proposed rule is necessary to implement the recommendations of ICCAT
and is necessary for management of the Atlantic tuna fisheries. 

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the
fishing category quotas proposed for 1994 will remain the same as current quotas. Also, the proposed changes to the
Incidental Catch category would alleviate some of the restrictions imposed on fishermen landing bluefin taken incidental
to longlining for swordfish, sharks and other tunas. These changes should facilitate enforcement of bluefin regulations,
would have a modest positive economic impact for some longline fishing trips and should help prevent waste of bluefin
tuna which would otherwise be discarded dead. Since the proposed changes would not significantly affect a substantial
number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This proposed rule is not subject to
review under E.O. 12866. 

This rule involves a clarification of an existing collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act that has been approved by OMB (control number 0648-0239). This change, in reference to the daily
dealer report, clarifies the requirement to indicate the type of measurement recorded for bluefin tuna weights and
lengths. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3 minutes per response
for completing the requirement and faxing to NMFS. Send any comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect
of this requirement, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS and OMB (see

3. Section 285.22 is revised to read as follows: 


 285.22

Quotas. 


The total annual (January 1-December 31) amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed
or landed by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the regulatory area is subdivided as follows: 
(a) 

General. 

The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or
landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the General category under  285.21(b) is 531 mt, of which
65 mt is set aside for a late-season fishery beginning 
September 15. On the basis of the statistics referenced at 
 285.20(b)(1), the Assistant Administrator will project a date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will
equal the annual quota minus 65 mt, and will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 stating that fishing for, retaining, possessing or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the early-season quota must
cease on that date at a specified hour, and not recommence until September 15, whereupon a quota equal to the difference
between the annual quota and the estimated catch prior to September 15 will become available. If the Assistant Administrator
determines (based on dealer reports, availability of large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna on the fishing grounds,
and any other relevant information) that variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migration patterns
of Atlantic bluefin tuna, and the catch rate, may prevent fishermen in an identified area from harvesting their share
of the quota, the Assistant Administrator may set aside an allocation of the late-season quota for such area. The amount
of any allocation shall not exceed the greater of 20 mt or the maximum reported landings in the identified area in any
of the preceding 3 years. The Assistant Administrator will publish notification of any set-aside allocation and
its basis in the 

Federal Register

. The daily catch limit for the identified area will be set at one large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna per day
per vessel. 
(b) 

Harpoon Boat. 

The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or
landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category under  285.21(b) is 53 mt. 
(c) 

Purse Seine. 

The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or
landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Purse Seine category under  285.21(b) is 301 mt. 
(d) 

Angling. 

The total annual amount of school, large school, and small medium Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained,
possessed or landed in the regulatory area by anglers is 219 mt. No more than 99 mt of this quota may be school Atlantic
bluefin tuna. This quota is further subdivided as follows: 
(1) 47 mt of school Atlantic bluefin tuna may be caught, retained, possessed or landed south of 38
 47
' N. latitude. 
(2) 52 mt of school Atlantic bluefin tuna may be caught, retained, possessed or landed north of 38
 47
' N. latitude. 
(e) 

Incidental. 

The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or
landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Incidental Catch category under  285.21(b) is 113
mt. This quota is further subdivided as follows: 
(1) 109 mt for longline vessels. No more than 86 mt may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the area south of
34
 00
' N. latitude. 
(2) For vessels fishing under  285.23 (a) and (d), 4 mt may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the regulatory
area. 
(f) 

Inseason adjustment amount. 

The total amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna that will be held in reserve for inseason adjustments is 18 mt. The Assistant
Administrator may allocate any portion (from 0 to 100 percent) of this amount to any category or categories of the fishery,
including research activities authorized under  285.1(c). The Assistant Administrator will publish a notification
of allocation of any inseason adjustment amount in the 

Federal Register

 before such allocation is to become effective. Before making any such allocation, the Assistant Administrator will
consider the following factors: 
(1) The usefulness of information obtained from catches of the particular category of the fishery for biological
sampling and monitoring the status of the stock; 
(2) The catches of the particular gear segment to date and the likelihood of closure of that segment of the fishery if
no allocation is made; 
(3) The projected ability of the particular gear segment to harvest the additional amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna
before the anticipated end of the fishing season; and 
(4) The estimated amounts by which quotas established for other gear segments of the fishery might be exceeded.

<TEXT>
 

(g) The catching or retention of school, large school or small medium Atlantic bluefin tuna is prohibited except as
allowed under paragraph (d) of this section. 
(h) In any year, if the Assistant Administrator determines, based on landing statistics and other available information,
that the prior year's quota in any category, or as appropriate, subcategory, has been exceeded or has not been reached,
the Assistant Administrator will subtract the overharvest from or add the underharvest to that quota for the subsequent
year; provided that the total of allocations and the reserve does not exceed the annual quota determined by ICCAT.
The Assistant Administrator will publish any amounts to be subtracted or added and the basis for the quota reductions
or increases in the 

Federal Register

. 
(i) Transfers between categories. The Assistant Administrator is authorized to make adjustments to quotas involving
transfers between vessel categories or, as appropriate, subcategories if the Assistant Administrator determines,
based on historical landing statistics, present year catch rates and effort, and other available information, that
any category, or as appropriate, subcategory, is not likely to take its entire quota as previously allocated for that
year. Given that determination, the Assistant Administrator may transfer, inseason, any portion of the quota of
any fishing category to any other fishing category or to the reserve after considering the four factors indicated
at paragraphs (f) (1) through (4) of this section, and the probability that any transfers between categories will
not result in the total quota being exceeded. The Assistant Administrator shall file a notification of transfer of
any inseason adjustment amount with the Office of the Federal Register before such transfer is to become effective.

4. Section 285.23 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: 


 285.23

Incidental catch. 


* * * * * 


(c) 

Longlines. 

Subject to the quotas in  285.22, any person operating a vessel using longline gear possessing an Incidental
Catch permit issued under  285.21 may retain or land large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna as an incidental
catch. The amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna retained or landed may not exceed: 
(1) One fish per vessel per fishing trip landed south of 34
 00
' N. latitude, provided that for the months of January through April at least 1,500 pounds (680 kg), and for the
months of May through December at least 3,500 pounds (1,588 kg), either dressed or round weight, of species other than
Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, and offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer
weighout as sold; and 
(2) Two percent by weight, either dressed or round weight, of all other fish legally landed, offloaded and documented
on the dealer weighout as sold at the end of each fishing trip, north of 34
 00
' N. latitude. 


* * * * * 


5. In  285.26, the text preceding the table is revised to read as follows: 


 285.26

Size classes. 



Straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of Atlantic bluefin tuna. For any Atlantic
bluefin tuna found with the head removed, it is deemed, for purposes of this subpart, that the tuna, when caught, fell
into a size class in accordance with the following formula: Total straight fork length equals pectoral fin straight
fork length multiplied by a factor of 1.35. For this purpose, all measurements must be taken in a straight line along
the middle of the lateral surface from a line perpendicular to the dorsal insertion of the pectoral fin of the beheaded
fish to a line perpendicular to the fork of the tail (PF, see Figure 1). The pectoral fin straight fork length will be
the sole criterion for determining the size class of a beheaded Atlantic bluefin tuna. Total straight fork length
will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of whole (head on) Atlantic bluefin tuna. Atlantic bluefin
tuna are deemed to fall into a size class according to the following table; approximate round weights are given for
illustrative purposes only.


* * * * * 


6. Section 285.29 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 285.29

Dealer recordkeeping and reporting. 


* * * * * 


(a) Must submit to the Regional Director via both electronic facsimile (FAX) and the existing postal system a daily
report on a reporting card provided by NMFS, within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna
from the person or vessel that harvested the fish. A FAX of said card must be received at the NMFS NE Regional Office (FAX
508-281-9135) within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Additionally,
said card must be postmarked and mailed within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Each
reporting card must be signed by the vessel permit holder or vessel operator to verify the name of the vessel that landed
the fish and must show the Atlantic bluefin tuna vessel permit number, metal tag number affixed to the fish by the dealer
or assigned by an authorized officer, the date landed, the port where landed, the round and/or dressed weight (indicating
which weight(s) measured), the total or pectoral fin straight and/or curved fork length (indicating which length(s)

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes regulations that would implement Amendment 25 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish
Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI). This amendment proposes to eliminate the primary Pacific
halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit that, when reached, requires NMFS to close Bycatch Limitation Zones
1 and 2H of the Bering Sea. NMFS also proposes regulations that would authorize the release of vessel-specific observer
data on bycatch of prohibited species, and prohibit the discard of salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI groundfish trawl
fisheries until each salmon has been counted by a NMFS-certified observer. This action is necessary for effective
management of the halibut PSC limit established for BSAI trawl fisheries and to provide better information on salmon
and other prohibited species bycatch. This action is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish
and other fish resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of
the BSAI and the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background



Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the
BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801, 

et seq.

) (Magnuson Act), and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and
675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620.

This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 25 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. If approved
by the Secretary, this amendment would eliminate the primary halibut PSC limit established for BSAI trawl fisheries.
This action also proposes two regulatory amendments that would (1) authorize the release of vessel-specific observer
data on bycatch of prohibited species, and (2) prohibit the discard of salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI groundfish
trawl fisheries until each salmon has been counted by a NMFS-certified observer. A description of, and reasons for,
each of the proposed measures is presented below. 



Amendment 25 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI 



A 4,400-mt primary halibut PSC limit was established for specified BSAI trawl fisheries under Amendment 12a to the
FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (54 FR 32642, August 9, 1989). When the primary halibut PSC limit was reached,
Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H were closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish species. The intent of
this closure was to reduce halibut bycatch rates experienced by the trawl fisheries without prohibiting the groundfish
trawl fisheries access to the entire BSAI groundfish resource. When the secondary halibut bycatch limit established
under Amendment 12a (5,333 mt) was reached, the entire BSAI was closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish
species. A justification for and intent of the primary halibut PSC limit was discussed in the preamble to the final
rule implementing Amendment 12a. Amendment 12a expired December 31, 1990, and was superseded by Amendment 16 to the
FMP. Amendment 16 and its implementing regulations (56 FR 2700, January 24, 1991) maintained the primary and secondary
halibut PSC limits at 4,400 mt and 5,333 mt, respectively. Amendment 19 to the FMP maintained the primary halibut PSC
limit at 4,400 mt, but reduced the secondary limit to 5,033 mt. This adjustment was effective only for the 1992 fishing
year (57 FR 43926, September 23, 1992). 

Under Amendment 19, the smaller difference between the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits frustrated NMFS'
ability to monitor the primary halibut PSC limit in a manner to allow closures before the secondary limit was reached.
As a result, trawl closures ensuing from halibut bycatch restrictions increasingly were implemented under the secondary
limit rather than the primary limit. This situation continues under Amendment 21 to the FMP, which superseded Amendment
19 and converted the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits established for trawl gear fisheries from catch limits
to mortality limits (3,300 mt mortality and 3,775 mt mortality, respectively) (58 FR 14524, March 18, 1993).

Questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness of the primary PSC mortality limit to reduce halibut bycatch
rates for two reasons. First, the minor difference between the primary and secondary limits constrains NMFS' ability
to implement fishery closures under the primary limit before the secondary limit is reached. Second, observer data
on halibut bycatch rates do not indicate that closure of Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H under the primary limit necessarily
reduces halibut bycatch rates to allow more groundfish to be harvested before the secondary limit is reached. To the
contrary, closure of Zones 1 and 2H often increases bycatch rates by forcing fisheries to move to areas with lower groundfish
catch per unit of effort and higher halibut bycatch rates. Once the secondary limit is reached, the entire BSAI is closed
to directed fishing for specified groundfish species by vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear (50 CFR 675.21(c)(1)(iv)).


To respond to these concerns, NMFS prepared a draft analysis for a proposed FMP amendment to eliminate the primary
halibut PSC limit. The draft analysis was reviewed by the Council and its Advisory Panel (AP) and Scientific and Statistical
Committee (SSC) during the Council's September 1992 meeting and adopted for public review. At its December 1992 meeting,
the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of the AP, SSC, fishing industry representatives, and
the general public on the proposed action to eliminate the primary halibut PSC mortality limit. The Council adopted
the proposed action under Amendment 25 to the FMP and requested NMFS to prepare a proposed rule to implement the action.
The action would not affect the secondary halibut bycatch mortality limit established for the BSAI trawl fisheries
(3,775 mt). 



Mandatory Retention of Salmon Until Counted by a NMFS-certified Observer 



At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS prepare a proposed rule for review and approval that
would prohibit the discard of salmon taken in the BSAI groundfish trawl fisheries until a NMFS-certified observer
has counted each fish and collected any scientific data or biological samples that the observer had been requested
by NMFS to obtain. Regulations to prohibit the discard of all salmon taken in groundfish trawl operations until an
observer has counted each salmon would provide the opportunity to collect better data on salmon bycatch. These data
could be used to assess the quality of bycatch rate estimates derived from existing observer sampling procedures
and provide additional information with which to assess the magnitude of salmon bycatch in the Alaska trawl fisheries.
Additional data collected on salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI trawl fisheries also could be used to assess long-term
management measures that may be developed to address the salmon bycatch problem. Mandatory retention of salmon until
counted by an observer also would support independent industry initiatives to explore factors that may be correlated
with salmon bycatch and identify changes in fishing operations that could reduce salmon bycatch rates. 

NMFS concurs that additional information on salmon bycatch would be desirable and is necessary to develop management
actions to address the salmon bycatch problem in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries. Regulations implementing
the Council's request would require operators of vessels carrying observers whose fishing operation allows for
sorting of groundfish catch to sort all salmon from the groundfish catch and store the salmon in a separate bin or other
location on the vessel that allows the observer free and unobstructed physical access to each salmon for observation
and collection of scientific data or biological samples. Operators of vessels not carrying observers onboard or
whose fishing operation does not allow for sorting of groundfish catch for salmon must ice, freeze, or store in a refrigerated
saltwater tank all salmon taken as bycatch in trawl operations for delivery to the processor receiving the vessel's
groundfish catch. 

Processors receiving groundfish from trawl vessels participating in a directed fishery for BSAI groundfish would
be required to retain all salmon delivered by each vessel during a weekly reporting period in separate bins marked
with the vessel's name and Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) fish ticket number(s) until a NMFS-certified
observer has counted each salmon and collected any scientific data or biological samples that are requested by the
NMFS Observer Program. Processors without observer coverage immediately available would be required to store all
salmon until a NMFS-certified observer is available to count each fish. Salmon must be stored at a location that allows
an observer free and unobstructed access to each salmon. 

NMFS proposes to require vessel operators and managers of shoreside processing operations to designate a crew person
or employee who would be responsible for proper sorting, retention, and storage of salmon until a NMFS-certified
observer has notified the vessel operator or manager of the shoreside operation that the number of salmon and any biological
samples have been obtained. Upon the request of the observer, the designated crew person or employee also would be
responsible to help count salmon and take biological samples from retained salmon under the direction of the observer.
The intent of this proposed requirement is to support industry initiatives to obtain better data on salmon bycatch
and to facilitate the collection of these data in a manner that does not jeopardize the collection of other scientific
or catch data that NMFS-certified observers currently are required to obtain. 

Processors without observer coverage would be required to freeze salmon until such time as an observer is available
to count retained fish. Some processors are never required to obtain an observer because their groundfish processing
operation never exceeds 500 metric tons (mt) during a single month. Mandatory retention would require these processing
operations to freeze salmon carcasses for an unknown period of time until an observer is obtained to count the fish.
Although not quantified, the associated costs to unobserved processing operations resulting from long-term storage
of salmon likely are unreasonable relative to the amounts of groundfish processed and corresponding salmon bycatch
that could be expected from the small amounts of groundfish delivered to these processing operations. Therefore,
NMFS proposes to exempt processors from mandatory retention of salmon during those months that the processor is exempt
from obtaining observer coverage under regulations implementing the Observer Program (50 CFR 672.27 and 675.25).
Currently, this exemption applies to mothership processors and shoreside processing facilities that receive less
than 500 mt of groundfish during a month.

All salmon, regardless of whether possessed at sea or at land-based processors, would be required to be returned to
Federal waters immediately with a minimum of injury regardless of condition, following notice by a NMFS-certified
observer that salmon have been counted and the collection of any scientific data or biological samples has been completed.
The discard of any salmon prior to notification by a NMFS-certified observer that salmon have been counted would constitute
a violation of regulations authorized under the Magnuson Act. Such violations would be subject to enforcement action
under the Magnuson Act. 



Release of Observer Data on Vessel Bycatch Amounts of Salmon and Bycatch Rates of Other Prohibited Species 



Observer data may be protected from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because it is considered
commercial or financial information (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). Release of such information may be facilitated by regulatory
action. 

At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a proposed rule that would authorize the release
of certain weekly observer data: The name and Federal permit number of each vessel participating in a directed fishery
for Alaska groundfish; the number of chinook salmon and other salmon species taken by each vessel; and the observed
bycatch rates of Pacific halibut, Pacific herring, king crab, and 

C. bairdi 

Tanner crab of vessels participating in the BSAI or GOA groundfish fisheries. Members of the groundfish industry
have requested that vessel bycatch amounts or rates be made available in as timely a manner as possible to support independent
industry initiatives to address the bycatch problem. 

To further support industry initiatives to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates in the groundfish trawl fisheries,
members of the groundfish industry have submitted a separate request to NMFS for the release of additional observer
data on prohibited species bycatch in most BSAI and GOA groundfish trawl fisheries. NMFS believes that disclosure
of these observer data collected since 1992 could facilitate research by industry on salmon and other prohibited
species bycatch that hopefully would lead to more informed decisions by vessel operators on alternative fishing
practices to minimize bycatch rates of these species. These data would not be identified by vessel and would include
the following data for observed hauls in the trawl fisheries: 



Date; 
Time of day gear is deployed; 
Latitude and longitude at beginning of haul; 
Bottom Depth; 
Fishing depth of trawl; 
Rate chinook salmon (number of salmon/mt groundfish); 
Rate other salmon (number of salmon/mt groundfish); 
Rate Pacific halibut (kilograms halibut/mt groundfish; 
Rate Pacific herring (kilograms herring/mt groundfish); 
Rate king crab (number of crab/mt groundfish); 
Rate bairdi Tanner crab (number of crab/mt groundfish); 
Sea surface temperature (where available); and 
Sea temperature at fishing depth of trawl (where available). 


 


Representatives of the Alaska trawl industry have requested that the above observer data on specific hauls not be
released for vessels participating in the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel trawl fisheries because
substantial competitive harm could result. These fisheries are conducted by a small number of vessels, involve relatively
small amounts of quota, and are geographically specific in nature. Releasing observer data on individual hauls could
effectively disclose commercial information of the current participants and cause them to suffer substantial competitive
harm. The rockfish, Greenland turbot, and Atka mackerel fisheries generally have low salmon bycatch rates and contribute
relatively little to the overall salmon bycatch amounts annually experienced in the Alaska trawl fisheries. Consequently,
excluding from disclosure the observer data collected onboard vessels participating in the rockfish, Greenland
turbot, or Atka mackerel fisheries is not anticipated to impair the effectiveness of industry initiatives to address
the salmon bycatch problem. 

Trawl industry representatives have not presented to NMFS concerns about the release of observer data that includes
vessel name and prohibited species bycatch amounts or rates or haul-specific observer data for groundfish fisheries
other than the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel fisheries. Other participants in the groundfish fisheries
may perceive that the release of these observer data may cause substantial competitive harm to vessel operators,
owners, or other persons involved in the groundfish fishing industry because the disclosure of haul location and
depth data for these fisheries involves the release of traditionally closely held commercial information. Therefore,
the disclosure of observer data on prohibited species bycatch and associated haul location and depth information
could possibly be expected to divulge information on specific fishing operations in a manner that would result in
substantial competitive harm. 

Pursuant to a request for information under the FOIA, NMFS has determined that the disclosure of observer data for
vessel haul location and depth in the BSAI pollock and cod fisheries collected during 1993 is not reasonably expected
to result in competitive harm. This disclosure is based on the determination that trawl operations for pollock and
cod in the BSAI occur within fairly well demarcated areas that have consistently supported historic foreign, joint
venture, and domestic fisheries for these species. Given the established nature of these fisheries and the relative
concentration of fishing effort to known fishing grounds, NMFS does not expect that the release of haul position and
depth would result in the identification of unique fishing operations for pollock and cod that are not already known
by the participants in these fisheries. However, NMFS still is concerned about whether the conditions allowing for
the disclosure of observer data collected in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod fisheries will continue in the future.
Accordingly, NMFS has not exempted the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod fisheries from this proposed rule.

This proposed rule is in accordance with Department of Commerce regulations relating to the disclosure of commercial
or financial information (15 CFR 4.7(h)). Under these regulations, NMFS may disclose commercial or financial information
if (1) a notice of intent to disclose such information is adopted by NMFS pursuant to notice and public comment, (2)
NMFS specifies narrow classes of records submitted to it that are to be released under the FOIA, and (3) NMFS provides
in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information
is submitted, that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive
harm. 

Consistent with 15 CFR 4.7(h), in exceptional circumstances, vessel owners and operators may provide to the Regional
Director written justification at the time the observer data are submitted, or within a reasonable time thereafter
(such as 24 hours), that disclosure of the informatio
