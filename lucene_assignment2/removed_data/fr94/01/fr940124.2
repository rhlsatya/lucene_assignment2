<DOCTITLE>West Fork Squaw Timber Sale; Clearwater National Forest, Idaho County, ID </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will analyze and disclose the environmental impacts of a proposal to harvest timber, regenerate
harvested timber stands, rehabilitate existing sediment sources, reconstruct existing roads, and construct new
roads in a portion of the West Fork Squaw Creek and Spring Creek drainages on the Powell Ranger District. An environmental
impact statement (EIS) will be prepared which will document the analysis. This EIS will tier to the Clearwater National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Final EIS of September 1987, which provides overall guidance in achieving
the desired condition for the area. The primary purpose and need of the proposed action is to implement land management
direction for the West Fork Squaw Creek and Spring Creek drainages. The goal is to develop a viable timber sale proposal
that is compatible with current resource management objectives.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The analysis area in which the proposed management activities would occur consists of approximately 3,650 acres
of National Forest land in the West Fork of Squaw Creek and Spring Creek drainage on the Powell Ranger District. The
study area includes all or portions of Sections 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 24 of T37N, R12E and Sections 6, 7, 18, and 19,
of T37N, R13E, Boise Meridian, Idaho County, Idaho. 



The Land and Resource Management Plan for the Clearwater National Forest provides the overall guidance for management
activities in the potentially affected area through its goals, objectives, standards, guidelines and management
area direction. In the West Fork Squaw Creek analysis area, four Forest Plan Management Areas are found: E1 which emphasized
optimum timber management, M2 which emphasizes protection of riparian values, A6 which emphasizes the cultural
and visual resources from the historic trail corridor, and US which is lands unsuitable for timber production. The
areas of proposed timber harvest, regeneration and associated road construction and reconstruction activities
are located in Management Area E1, which emphasizes optimum sustained timber production.

To date, considerable scoping and analysis has been done in regard to the proposed action. In April 1991 the staff of
the Powell Ranger District began an Integrated Resource Analysis (IRA) of the West Fork of Squaw Creek (Silvicultural
compartment 621) to identify the existing and desired conditions. During December of 1991, a Position Statement
was sent to the staff of the Clearwater National Forest, State agencies, the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee,
and other known local interest groups and individuals informing the public of the analysis and seeking comment. In
January 1992, an Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) was assigned to continue the analysis after receiving a number of comments
during the initial scoping phase. This team identified the primary issues in February 1992 after reviewing the input
received.
The key issues identified by the Interdisciplinary Team are:
1. Scenery_Proposed logging and road construction may influence, either positively or negatively, the view from
the Lolo Trail Corridor, which consists of the Lolo motorway, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, and the Lewis &
Clark National Historic Landmark.
2. Fisheries and Water Quality_Proposed logging and road construction will be analyzed for sediment production
and potential mitigation measures to determine effects on the west fork and mainstem of Squaw Creek (recently recovered
to minimum Forest Plan standards) affecting the Spring/Summer Chinook salmon and the bull trout.
3. Old Growth, Wildlife, and Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Species_
Old Growth_Proposed logging and road construction may reduce the level of old-growth habitat in the analysis area
and further fragment corridors linking areas of old-growth habitat. Potential Old Growth stands within or adjacent
to proposed activities will be field verified.
Wildlife_Timber harvesting and road construction may create new openings, decreasing suitable habitat needed
for wildlife. Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Species_Timber harvesting and road construction may affect
Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive species or their habitat.
4. Timber Management_Proposed logging may increase overall stand productivity by removing timber which has reached
biological maturity and by removing timber which is infected with bark beetles and disease pathogens. Proposed logging
would also contribute timber to the local and National timber supply.
5. Economics_Proposed logging and environmental protection measures may affect the economic viability of a timber
sale offering.
In response to the identified issues and concerns, the IDT has described four management alternatives. One of these
is the ``no-action'' alternative in which timber harvest, timber stand regeneration, and road construction/reconstruction
activities would not be implemented. Three other alternatives will examine various levels and locations of timber
harvest, rehabilitation of active sediment sources, and road construction/reconstruction activity. Various
mixes of timber and non-timber resource values of each alternative will also be examined.
Under the action alternatives that the Interdisciplinary Team has described to this point, timber harvest ranges
from 1.9 to 3.9 million board feet (MMBF), with harvest directly affecting from 323 to 472 acres. To access proposed
harvest units, up to 0.9 mile of new road construction and no road reconstruction would be required.
The preliminary analysis indicates that tentative alternatives may have significant effects to the environment.
The Responsible Official, Margaret J. Gorski, Powell District Ranger, has decided to continue the analysis and document
it with an Environmental Impact Statement. Due to changed environmental conditions, the proposed action is changed
from the original position statement.
The Forest Service is now seeking further information and comments from Federal, State, local agencies, and other
individuals or organizations who are interested in or affected by the proposed action. This additional input will
be used in preparing the Draft EIS (DEIS).
The process will include:
1. Identification of additional potential issues.
2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.
3. Elimination of insignificant issues.
4. Identification of additional reasonable alternatives.

5. Identification of potential environmental effects of the alternatives. 

6. Determination of potential cooperating agencies. 

The EIS will disclose the environmental effects of alternative ways of implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Service
will analyze and document the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the alternatives. In addition, the EIS
will disclose site specific mitigation measures and their expected effectiveness. 

Public participation will be especially important at several points in the analysis. People are encouraged to visit
with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. A Final EIS is expected to be
filed in November 1994. Two key time periods have been identified for receipt of formal comments on the analysis: 

1. Scoping period (now through January 1994). 

2. Review of the Draft EIS in June 1994. 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Interior, will be informally consulted throughout the analysis.
To meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will review the EIS and Biological
Assessment of the effects on Threatened and Endangered species, including the grizzly bear, gray wolf, and fall chinook
salmon. 

The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review by
May 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the DEIS in the 

Federal Register

. After a 45-day public comment period, the comments received will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service
in the final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by November 1994. The Forest
Service will respond in the FEIS to the comments received on the DEIS. The responsible official is the District Ranger
of the Powell Ranger District, Clearwater National Forest, Lolo, Montana 59847. The decision and reasons for the
decision will be documented in a Record of Decision. 

The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement. 

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer
to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

<DOCTITLE>G. Antolini and Son, Colson Quarry Operations 


</DOCTITLE>
<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA and Pacific Unified School District.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as required by the National Environmental
Quality Act (NEPA). The proposed project is to evaluate a 10-Year Plan of Operations submitted by G. Antolini and Son
for continuing quarrying operations at the Colson Quarry. The quarry is located on the Santa Lucia Ranger District,
Los Padres National Forest, Santa Barbara County, California. The proposal could result in the approval of the proposed
Operating Plan and the issuance of a Contract for the Sale of Mineral Materials to G. Antolini and Son. Operating period
could be for as little as five years or as long as ten years. Proposed operating volume is an annual maximum of two thousand
tons.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The project has been proposed by G. Antolini and Son, in order to continue quarrying operations inside approximately
fifty acres of National Forest System lands on the Los Padres National Forest. The proposed operation would involve
additional open-pit mining of decorative building stone from approximately eighteen acres of National Forest System
lands. The remaining thirty-two acres is divided into sixteen acres for support facilities and sixteen acres for
old waste dumps. Disposal of mine wastes would be inside of the existing quarry area. Annual volume of stone removed
from the quarry would not exceed 2000 tons per year. Proposed project is for a total of ten years.



The original proposal by G. Antolini and Son resulted in the preparation of an environmental assessment for the proposed
action and four alternatives. The four alternatives included ``No Action'' and three alternatives that would allow
quarrying operations. The three operating alternatives vary in the amounts of Forest land that would be disturbed,
the different operating requirements and/or the lengths imposed on the total operating time. Based on agency scoping
and issues related to reclamation and the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act [SMARA] (California Public Resources
Code 2710 

et seq.

), it was determined that an environmental impact statement would be required.

The project will require G. Antolini and Son to submit to the Resource Management Department, Santa Barbara County,
California, a Reclamation Plan as per SMARA. Any decision to approve the proposed Operating Plan would be in accordance
with Forest Service rules and regulations for the disposal of mineral materials as found at 36 CFR 228.40 through 228.67
and the regulations contained in SMARA. The County of Santa Barbara, California, as per the October 1992 Memorandum
of Understanding between the State of California, Department of Conservation and the State Mining and Geology Board,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, and the U.S. Department of the Interior,
Bureau of Land Management, California, will be accepting the final EIS as a functionally equivalent document to meet
their requirements under SMARA.

In an effort to inform and to seek new information, comments and assistance during the original scoping period, the
Santa Lucia Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest, formally contacted ninety-two Federal, State, and local
agencies and other individuals and organizations who potentially were interested in or were affected by the proposed
action in December 1992. An additional twenty-four potentially interested individuals were formally contacted
in January 1993. A total of seven written responses were received by the Forest Service. This input was used to determine
the scope of the document and to validate the range of alternatives. The final phase of the public involvement process
will be the request for public comments on the draft EIS.

Preliminary issues which have been identified are: visual viewshed, cultural and paleontological resource impacts,
slope stability, rehabilitation and reclamation of the mine and all of the associated area, impacts to water quality,
impacts to air quality, noise pollution, additional traffic and the need for road maintenance, impacts to the biological
resources, and socioeconomic effects.

The responsible official for the Forest Service and the NEPA process is Kathryn J. Silverman, District Ranger, Santa
Lucia Ranger District, 1616 Carlotti Drive, Santa Maria, California, 93454.

The decision to be made by the District Ranger is whether or not to approve the proposed 10-Year Plan of Operations for
the Colson Quarry, as submitted by G. Antolini and Son, or to select another alternative for management of the current
quarry and the associated National Forest System lands.

The estimated date for completion of the DEIS is February 22, 1994. The estimated date for completion of the final EIS
is April 14, 1994.

The comment period of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the Federal Register.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is importation to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts the agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed Millwood Timber Sale, Council
Ranger District, Payette National Forest, Idaho. The proposed sale would construct road and harvest timber within
a portion of the Council Mountain Roadless Area that the Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan
(1988) allocated to multiple use management.


The agency gives notice of the environmental analysis and decision-making process that is beginning on the proposal
so that interested and affected people know how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. The agency
invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis, including issues to be addressed during the analysis.
A scoping meeting will be held to gather comments from the public on the proposed action. The meeting will be Thursday,
February 3, at 7 p.m. at the Council Ranger District office conference room in Council, Idaho. Forest Service officials
will explain the proposed action and planning process, and accept public input.
A scoping document explaining the proposed action and analysis process is also available from the contacts identified
below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The USDA Forest Service is proposing to construct 18.8 miles of road and harvest about 17.5 million board feet of timber
from 1,847 acres of suitable timber lands within the Millwood timber sale area. A mix of silvicultural treatments
is proposed, including 209 acres of commercial thinning, 467 acres of shelterwood (about 35 percent crown canopy
closure), 351 acres of irregular shelterwood (50-60 percent crown canopy closure), 452 acres of reserve tree
(about 5 trees per acre), 306 acres of sanitation/salvage, and 62 acres of strata 21 rehabilitation. This mix of silvicultural
prescriptions seeks to retain suitable habitat for sensitive species within all treatment units where it currently
exists, improve forest health (resilience and resistance to insect and disease), and increase dominance of seral
ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir.



Helicopter logging is proposed for 150 acres (8 percent of the treatment acreage). Skyline logging is proposed for
894 acres (48 percent of the treatment acreage). Tractor logging is proposed for 803 acres (44 percent of the treatment
acreage). The proposed mix of logging systems seeks to protect leave stands and regenerate stands in a cost efficient
and cost effective manner.

This sale lies within the Council Mountain Roadless Area, Adams County, Idaho. Mill Creek and Cottonwood Creek are
the two drainages within the proposed timber sale area; both are tributaries of the Weiser River.

The proposal follows direction in the Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, 1988 (Forest Plan).
The decision to be made is whether the sale area should be entered at this time for timber harvest and associated activities,
and, if so, the specific conditions of entry.

Preliminary issues include the proposal's effect on roadless characteristics, vegetation, water quality, biological
diversity, fisheries, soils, wildlife habitat, and economics.

Preliminary alternatives being considered include no action, one that seeks to achieve Forest Plan objectives to
maximize timber growth and yield, and the proposed action alternative that modifies timber management intensity
in response to the preliminary issues.

A draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) considering the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives
will be prepared. The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to be available for
public review by March 1995. The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers early notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of that proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The USDA Forest Service is proposing to construct 10.0 miles of road and harvest about 14.9 million board feet of timber
from 1,145 acres of suitable timber lands within the Crystal Creek timber sale area. A mix of silvicultural treatments
is proposed, including 8 acres of commercial thinning, 101 acres of shelterwood (about 35 percent crown canopy closure),
643 acres of reserve tree (about 5 trees per acre), and 393 acres of sanitation/salvage. This mix of silvicultural
prescriptions seeks to retain suitable habitat for sensitive species within all treatment units where it currently
exists, improve forest health (resilience and resistance to insect and disease), and increase dominance of seral
ponderosa pine and douglas-fir.



Helicopter logging is proposed for 354 acres (31 percent of the treatment acreage). Skyline logging is proposed for
322 acres (28 percent of the treatment acreage). Tractor logging is proposed for 469 acres (41 percent of the treatment
acreage). The proposed mix of logging systems seeks to protect leave stands and regenerate stands in a cost efficient
and cost effective manner.

This sale lies within the council Mountain Roadless Area, Adams County, Idaho. Crystal Creek and Lake Creek are the
two drainages within the proposed timber sale area; both are tributaries of the Middle Fork Weiser River.

The proposal follows direction in the Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, 1988 (Forest Plan).
The decision to be made is whether the sale area should be entered at this time for timber harvest and associated activities,
and, if so, the specific conditions of entry.

Preliminary issues include the proposal's effect on roadless characteristics, vegetation, water quality, biological
diversity, fisheries, soils, wildlife habitat, and economics.

Preliminary alternatives being considered include no action, an alternative that seeks to achieve forest Plan objectives
to maximize timber growth and yield, and the proposed action alternative that modifies timber management intensity
in response to the preliminary issues.

A draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) considering the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives
will be prepared. The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and to be available for
public review by March 1995. The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers early notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of that proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but
that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel

, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Circut, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

The final environmental impact statement is scheduled to be completed by July 1995.

The Responsible Official is David F. Alexander, Forest Supervisor, Payette National Forest, McCall, ID 83638.

Business Development Center Applications: Dayton, OH MSA (Service Area)





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minority Business Development Agency, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995 is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Dayton, Ohio geographic service area. The award number of this MBDC will be 05-10-94006-01.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points).

<TEXT>
 

An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
awards may result in an applicant not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not
necessarily receive the award. 

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000. 

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Certificate of Interim Extension of the Term of U.S. Patent No. 4,005,196; Olestra</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of patent term extension.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Patent and Trademark Office has issued a certificate under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) for a one-year interim extension
of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,005,196 that claims the food additive known as olestra.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 156 of Title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.



On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103-179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.

On January 7, 1994, Procter & Gamble Company, owner of record in the Patent and Trademark Office of U.S. Patent
No. 4,005,196, filed an application for interim extension of the term of this patent under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5). The
application states that the patent claims a composition of matter comprising the food additive product olestra.
The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing a regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration
for permission to market or use the product commercially. The original term of the patent is set to expire on January
25, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the term of the patent for a period of one year.

Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156. Since it is apparent that the regulatory
review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the patent term
under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) of the term
of U.S. Patent No. 4,005,196 has been granted for a period of one year from the original expiration date of the patent.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following described land in Eureka County, Nevada, has been examined and found suitable for airport lease under
the Act of May 24, 1928, as amended (49 U.S.C., Appendix 211-213). The lands will not be offered for lease until
at least 60 days after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register.


Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada


T. 29 N., R. 48 E.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Eureka County Board of Commissioners has applied to lease an existing airstrip which serves the unincorporated
Town of Crescent Valley, Nevada, and surrounding vicinity. The lands were previously leased for airport purposes
by a succession of private individuals; however, the lease was allowed to expire the Eureka County has now applied
to lease the airstrip. The land is not required for any Federal purpose. Issuance of the lease would be consistent with
the Bureau's planning for the area.


The described lands were previously segregated from mineral entry by virtue of the previous lease, but were never
opened to entry upon expiration of the lease. Accordingly, this notice continues to segregate the lands from all forms
of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. Upon termination of the lease, the segregative
effect would terminate as specified in an opening order published in the 

Federal Register.

 The lease when issued, will be subject to the provisions of the Act of May 24, 1928, and applicable regulations (43 CFR
2911) of the Secretary of the Interior.
On or before March 10, 1994 interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager, Elko District Office,
P.O. Box 831, Elko, NV 89803. Any objections will be evaluated by the State Director, who may sustain, vacate or modify
this realty action. In the absence of timely filed objections, this realty action will become a final determination
of the Department of the Interior.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact for an Incidental Take Permit for the Proposed Lake Pointe Development, Austin,
Travis County, TX</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has prepared an Environmental Assessment for issuance of a section 10(a)(1)(B)
permit for the incidental take of the Federally endangered golden-cheeked warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

) during construction and operation of a 496 acre mixed residential and commercial development known as Lake Pointe
in Austin, Travis County, Texas.



Proposed Action



The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act to authorize
the incidental take of the golden-cheeked warbler.

The Applicant plans to build 850 single-family residences, a 10-acre commercial site, an elementary school, and
associated streets and utility corridors in southwest Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately
354 acres with the remaining 142 acres for open space, conducting golden-cheeked warbler monitoring studies, providing
$90,000 to fund the acquisition of golden-cheeked warbler habitat preserves, and constructing and maintaining
a fence between the proposed development and the areas of open space set aside for the golden-cheeked warbler. Details
of the mitigation are provided in the Lake Pointe Habitat Conservation Plan. Guarantees for implementation are provided
in the Agreement and the Management Agreement.

These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance of an incidental take permit will
be fully satisfied.



Alternatives Considered



1. No action,

2. Proposed action,

3. Alternate project location,

4. Reduce the proposed project, and

5. Wait for the completion of the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan Section 10(a) permit.



Determination



Based upon information contained in the Environmental Assessment and the Habitat Conservation Plan, the Service
has determined that this action is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect the quality of the human
environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly,
the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed action is not required.

It is my decision to approve the issuance of the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit for the construction of the 496 acre mixed
residential/commercial development known as Lake Pointe Development in Austin, Travis County, Texas.

Overlook at Cat Mountain Development, Austin, Travis County, TX</DOCTITLE>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Overlook, Incorporated (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take
permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit Number
PRT-782824. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction and operation of a residential development on a 213
acre tract in Austin, Travis County, Texas.






The Service has prepared an environment assessment (EA) for the incidental take application. A determination of
jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of
publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental
Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are at 50 CFR 17.22.





The Applicant plans to build a residential development on a 213 acre tract on RR2222 at Far West Blvd., west of Austin,
Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 86.84 acres including 10.58 acres of impervious
cover (i.e., streets, rooftops and driveways) with the remaining 126.16 acres proposed as conservation areas. These
activities will permanently eliminate about 86.84 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species habitat.
The applicant proposed to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 126.16 acres for open space, and providing
sufficient money to purchase land containing six golden-cheeked warbler territories adjacent to, or within, a preserve
that is managed for the warbler, and money, or other compensation, to operate and manage those lands for the life of
the permit.




The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four of them because they were not economically viable.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FGDC is sponsoring a public review of the United States National Cartographic Standards for Spatial Accuracy.
The standard specifies the means of calculating horizontal and vertical accuracy for map graphics, the method by
which accuracy will be tested, the label to be applied to products that have been tested, and the application of the
standard to map series.


The FGDC anticipates that the final standard will be submitted to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for the replacement
of the National Map Accuracy Standards, the last revision of which was issued by the former Bureau of the Budget in 1947.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed standard is based on work published by the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. The
society recommended that the draft replace the existing National Map Accuracy Standards. The standard has been reviewed
by components of the FGDC, and is now in final review in the committee.

<DOCTITLE>The A&G Railroad, L.L.C.; Acquisition and Operation Exemption; Rail Lines of Abbeville & Grimes Railway
Company </DOCTITLE>




The A&G Railroad, L.L.C. (A&G) has filed a notice of exemption to acquire from Abbeville & Grimes Railway
Company (Abbeville) and to operate approximately 27 rail miles in Alabama, between Abbeville and Grimes, together
with incidental trackage rights over 7 miles of CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) lines between Grimes and Dothan,
AL, and substantially all of the other railroad operating assets of Abbeville. The proposed transaction is expected
to be consummated promptly upon the effectiveness of the exemption. 
A&G is 100% owned and controlled by Rail Partners, L.P. (Partners), a Delaware limited partnership, and Panama
City Beach Office Park, Ltd. (Office Park), a Florida limited partnership (collectively, Owners). Neither Partners
nor Office Park is a carrier, and Office Park does not currently control a carrier. However, Partners is jointly owned
and controlled by Mr. K. Earl Durden (Durden), Green Bay Packaging, Inc. (GBP), and Rail Management and Consulting
Corporation (RMCC), and with them jointly owns and controls several class III rail carriers. Office Park is jointly
owned and controlled by Partners and RMCC, and is thus under common control with those class III carriers. 
None of the class III carriers currently affiliated with Owners connects with A&G. However, Durden, GBP, Partners,
and RMCC are, by a contemporaneously filed notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32436, 

Rail Management and Consulting Corporation, Green Bay Packaging, Inc., K. Earl Durden, and Rail Partners, L.P._Continuance
in Control Exemption_the Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C.,

 seeking to continue in control of another company they own, the Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C. (Bay Line), upon Bay Line's
becoming a carrier by purchase and operation of the lines of the Atlanta & St. Andrews Bay Railroad, Inc. (ASAB),
a transaction subject to an exemption notice filed in Finance Docket No. 32435, 

The Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C._Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Rail Lines of Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay Railroad
Company. 

Because A&G and Bay Line connect by means of incidental trackage rights over CSXT, between Grimes and Dothan,
the ownership of A&G will be placed in an independent voting trust prior to closing to prevent Durden, RMCC, GBP,
Partners, and Office Park from retaining direct control over A&G once it becomes a carrier. After the closing,
a separate petition for exemption, or other pleading, will be filed with the Commission, seeking authority for them
to dissolve the voting trust and acquire direct control over A&G. 
Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on Donald G. Avery, Slover & Loftus, 1224 17th Street,
NW, Washington, DC 20036. 
This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is
void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. 


Decided: January 18, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Rail Management and Consulting Corporation, Green Bay Packaging, Inc., K. Earl Durden, and Rail Partners, L.P._Continuance
in Control Exemption_The Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C. </DOCTITLE>




Green Bay Packaging, Inc. (GBP), Rail management and Consulting Corporation (RMCC), Rail Partners, L.P. (Partners),
and K. Earl Durden (Durden) (collectively, Owners), all noncarriers, have filed a notice of exemption to continue
to control The Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C. (Bay Line)

, a noncarrier, upon Bay Line's becoming a carrier. Bay Line has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance
Docket No. 32435, The Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C._Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Rail Lines of Atlanta &
St. Andrews Bay Railroad Company, to acquire from the Atlanta & St. Andrews Bay Railroad Company (ASAB), approximately
88 miles of main line trackage running from Panama City, FL, to Dothan, AL, together with substantially all of the other
railroad operating assets of ASAB. 




Owners jointly control 10 class III rail carriers. Additionally, Durden individually controls another short line,
the Lakeside Transportation Co. Owners indicate that: (1) Bay Line does not connect with any other railroad controlled
by Owners; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect Bay
Line with any other railroad controlled by Owners;
 and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval
requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). 




As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Donald G.
Avery, Slover & Loftus, 1224 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20036.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






January 18, 1994.




Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Credit Against the Annual Assessments and Fees on Members





Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 14, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule A to the By-Laws to adjust the amount of credit as set forth in Section
1(d) of Schedule A, which is currently 67%, to 59%, and to amend the calendar year dates from 1993 to 1994.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to Article VI of the By-Laws of the Corporation, the NASD requires its members to pay an annual assessment
fee based on gross income as defined by Schedule A, Section 1 to the By-Laws.
 The NASD also allows a credit against such assessment pursuant to Section 1(d). The NASD calculates the gross income
assessment from the gross income reported for the calendar or fiscal year preceding the NASD's calendar budget year.
Based on the operating budget for 1994, and subject to revision based on final actual gross income reports for 1993,
the NASD is proposing to amend the credit to adjust member assessments to reflect the estimated revenue needed to fund
1994 operations. This proposed rule change, therefore, amends the amount of credit set forth in Section 1(d) of Schedule
A to the By-Laws, which is currently 67%, to 59%, and applies the credit to the entire 1994 calendar budget year, and
amends the calendar year dates from 1993 to 1994.







The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and
other charges among members in that the proposed rule change equitably adjusts the 1994 assessment credit rate based
on the projected 1994 budget.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and Section
(e) of Rule 19b-4 promulgated there under in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge imposed by a self-regulatory
organization.

At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted on February
14, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Security Life of Denver Insurance Co., et al.</DOCTITLE>




January 18, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (``Security Life''), Security Life Separate Account A1 (the ``Account''),
certain separate accounts that may be created in the future, and SLD Equities, Inc. (``SLD Equities'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) for exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit them to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Account,
which funds certain deferred variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'') featuring an enhanced death benefit.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the Application. The complete Application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Security Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Colorado and is the depositor of the Account.
The Account was organized under Colorado law, and is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust. That portion
of the assets of the Account that is equal to the reserves and other Contract liabilities with respect to the Account
is not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of Security Life. Any income, gains, or losses,
realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Account are credited to or charged against the Account without
regard to other income, gains, or losses of Security Life. The Account is divided into six divisions, each of which
invests exclusively in shares of The Palladian Trust (the ``Trust''). The Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end
management investment company.

2. SLD Equities, a registered broker-dealer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security Life, will be the principal
underwriter of the Contracts.

3. The Contracts provide for retirement payments or other long-term benefits for persons covered under plans that
receive favorable federal income tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for persons desiring such
benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. The minimum initial purchase payment is $25,000 for a non-qualified
Contract and $1,500 for a qualified Contract. The minimum additional purchase payment is $500 for a non-qualified
Contract and $250 for a qualified Contract. Annuity payments under a Contract may be received on a variable basis.

<PARENT> FR940124-2-00040 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. The administrative charges to be assessed under the Contracts will be (a) an administrative charge of $30 per Contract
year, during the accumulation period only, if total purchase payments in the first Contract year are less than $100,000
and (b) a daily asset-based charge, at an annual effective rate of 0.15%, during both the accumulation and annuity
periods. Security Life guarantees that it will not raise these administrative charges for the duration of the Contracts.
Security Life also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will
be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average, excluding costs that properly
are categorized as distribution expenses, over the period that the Contracts are in force.

5. If more than one demand partial withdrawal occurs during a Contract year, there will be a charge of the lesser of $25
of 2% of the amount withdrawn for each additional demand partial withdrawal. Security Life represents that it does
not expect that the total revenues from the partial withdrawal transaction charge will be greater than the total expected
cost of administering demand partial withdrawals, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force.

6. The Contracts will permit transfers among the divisions of the Account, subject to certain conditions. Prior to
the annuity date, an Owner will be able to make up to 12 transfers each Contract year at no charge. Each additional transfer
will be subject to a charge of $25. After the annuity date, an Owner will be able to make no more than four transfers each
Contract year. No charge will be assessed for a transfer after the annuity date. Security Life represents that it does
not expect that the total revenues from the excess transfer charges will be greater than the total expected cost of
administering excess transfers, on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force. Security Life represents
that the amount that it will recover for premium taxes will not be greater than the amount of premium taxes required
to be paid.

7. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a surrender
charge will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken
during the six year period from the date Security Life receives and accepts each purchase payment. The surrender charge
in the first Contract year is 7%, and reduces by 1% each Contract year thereafter; there is no surrender charge applicable
to the withdrawal of payments that are six or more years old. In no event is the surrender charge greater than the amount
withdrawn.

8. Applicants seek to impose a daily asset-based charge equal to 1.55% annually to compensate Security Life for certain
mortality and expense risks it bears under the Contracts. Security Life will assume several mortality risks under
the Contracts. First, Security Life assumes a mortality risk arising from the fact that the Contract does not impose
any surrender charge on the death benefit. Second, Security Life assumes an additional mortality risk by its contractual
obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the Annuitant under annuity options involving
life contingencies. Third, Security Life will assume a mortality risk because of its promise to pay a death benefit
to the beneficiary if the Owner dies prior to the annuity date. This assures each Annuitant that neither the Annuitant's
own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the annuity payments
received under a Contract. At the same time, Security Life assumes the risk that Annuitants as a group will live longer
than Security Life's annuity tables had predicted, which would require Security Life to pay out more in annuity income
than planned. The contracts contain annuity tables that are based on the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table
and, for variable annuity options, alternative net investment factors of 3% or 5%. Security Life guarantees these
annuity tables for the duration of the Contracts.

9. In general, the Contracts provide for a death benefit that is the greatest of: (a) The purchase payments made (less
partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken), accumulated at 7% per
year (the interest rate for any Owner of attained age 75 or greater is 0%) up to a maximum of two times the sum of all purchase
payments (less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken); (b) the
accumulation value at the time of death; and (c) the step-up benefit plus purchase payments made, less partial withdrawals
and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since the last step-up anniversary. The step-up
benefit at issue is the initial purchase payment. At each step-up anniversary, the current accumulation value is
compared to the prior determination of the step-up benefit, increased by purchase payments made and reduced by partial
withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken since that anniversary. The greater
of these becomes the new step-up benefit. The step-up anniversaries are the Contract date and every sixth Contract
anniversary thereafter (

i.e.,

 sixth, twelfth, eighteenth, etc. Contract anniversaries). The death benefit equal to the accumulation value, or
to the sum of the purchase payments made less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction
charges taken, constitutes the basic death benefit. The death benefit in excess of the foregoing basic death benefit,
including purchase payments accumulated at 7% interest as described above, and the step-up benefits as described
above, constitutes the enhanced death benefit.

10. In addition to mortality risks, Security Life will assume an expense risk under the Contracts. This risk arises
because the administrative charges under outstanding Contracts, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to
cover actual administrative expenses.

11. As compensation for assuming these mortality and expense risks, Security Life proposes to assess against the
Account a daily charge at an annual aggregate rate of 1.55%. Approximately 1.20% of this annual charge is allocated
to the mortality risks that Security Life will assume, and 0.35% is allocated to the expense risks that Security Life
will assume. Of the 1.20% charge allocated to the mortality risk, 0.90% is for the cost of the basic death benefit and
the other mortality risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts, and 0.30% is for the cost of the enhanced death
benefit. Security Life will assess the charge for mortality and expense risks during the accumulation period and
annuity period, except that Security Life will not assess the 0.30% charge for the enhanced death benefit during the
annuity period. Security Life guarantees that it will not raise the charge for the duration of the Contracts.

12. If the administrative charges and the mortality and expense risk charge are insufficient to cover the expenses
and costs assumed, the loss will be borne by Security Life. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient,
the excess will be profit to Security Life. Security Life represents that it likely will earn a profit from the mortality
and expense risk charge. To the extent that the surrender charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs of distribution,
the expenses will be paid from Security Life's general account assets, which will include profit, if any, derived
from the mortality and expenses risk charge.

13. Applicants request that the order also permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets
of any other separate account established by Security Life in the future to support deferred variable annuity contracts,
which contracts are offered on a basis that is similar in all material respects to the basis on which the Contracts are
offered.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Applicants submit
that their request for an order that applies to the Account and to future separate accounts issuing contracts that
are substantially similar to the Contracts is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness
in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for Security Life to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. The delay and expense
involved in having to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair Security Life's ability to effectively take
advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent
with the purposes of the Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If Security Life were required to
repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application, investors would
not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions
are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act.

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter
thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a
trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the Act and are held under an agreement
that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants'
proposed mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense.

3. Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% (which includes the basic mortality
risk charge of 0.90% and the expense risk charge of 0.35%), or 1.55% (which includes the foregoing charge of 1.25% and
the enhanced mortality risk charge of 0.30%), is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under
the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products.
Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly available information about
similar industry practices, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels and benefits provided,
the existence of expense charge guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Security Life undertakes to maintain
at its home office, and make available to the Commission or its staff upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail
the methodology used in making the foregoing determinations.

<TEXT>
 

4. Applicants assert that the mortality risk charge of 0.30% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable in relation
to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts. In arriving at this determination, Security Life conducted
a large number of trials at different issue ages to determine the expected cost of the enhanced death benefit. First,
hypothetical asset returns were projected using generally accepted actuarial simulation methods. For each asset
return pattern generated, hypothetical accumulated values were calculated by applying the projected asset returns
to the initial value in a hypothetical account. Each accumulated value so calculated was then compared to the amount
of the enhanced death benefit payable in the event of the hypothetical Owner's death during the year in question. By
analyzing the results of a statistically valid number of such simulations, Security Life was able to determine actuarially
the level cost of providing the enhanced death benefit. Based on this analysis, Security Life determined that the
mortality risk charge of 0.30% was a reasonable charge for providing the enhanced death benefit. Security Life undertakes
to maintain at its home office a memorandum, available to the Commission and its staff upon request, setting forth
in detail the methodology used in determining that the risk charge of 0.30% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable
in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts.

5. The surrender charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In that
event, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset
by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Security Life
has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will
benefit the Account and its Owners. Security Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available upon
request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting out the basis for such conclusion.

6. Security Life also represents that the Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes,
in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated
and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Act.



Applicants' Conclusion



Applicants submit that, for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the Act meet the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions
requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Each of the Funds is a series, and separate diversified portfolio of, the Trust, a registered open-end management
investment company. The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The Adviser, a majority-owned subsidiary
of NWNL Companies, Inc., is a registered investment adviser that will provide investment advisory services to each
of the Funds. The Distributor is a registered broker-dealer that will act as principal underwriter of the Funds' shares,
and is an affiliated person of the Adviser.

2. Applicants propose to establish a multiple class distribution system (the ``Multi-Class Distribution System'')
to enable each of the Funds to offer an unlimited number of classes of shares that would be subject to a front-end sales
load, a CDSC, a rule 12b-1 plan providing for a distribution fee and service fee, a combination of the above, or
none of the above. Classes of shares that do not have a front-end sales load, and are subject to a rule 12b-1 plan
and a CDSC are referred to herein as ``Deferred Option'' classes. Applicants will comply with Article III, Section
26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, which limits the amount of asset-based distribution charges a Fund may assess.
All Fund expenditures for distribution will be made in accordance with rule 12b-1.

3. Each Fund currently intends to offer only two classes of shares (``Class A'' and ``Class B''). Some or all of the Funds
may not in fact create or issue additional classes of shares. 

4. The Funds will offer Class A shares at net asset value plus a front-end sales load. The front-end sales loads generally
would be subject to reductions for larger purchases and under a right of accumulation. Class A shares also will be subject
to a rule 12b-1 plan providing for distribution and service fees at a combined annual rate of up to .30 percent
of the average daily net asset value of that class. In addition, Class A shareholders who purchase shares at net asset
value without the imposition of a front-end sales load may be subject to a low level CDSC (not to exceed 2 percent of net
asset value) for a specified period, not to exceed two years, from the date of purchase when they redeem their Class
A shares. The purpose of such a sales charge is to reimburse the Distributor for commissions paid to dealers at the time
of sale from the Distributor's own resources.

5. The Funds will offer Class B shares at net asset value subject to a CDSC, as described below. Class B shares also will
be subject to a rule 12b-1 plan providing for combined distribution and service fees at an annual rate of up to
1 percent of the average daily net asset value of that class.

6. Investment income and unrealized and realized gains or losses will be allocated daily to each class of shares based
on the percentage of net assets of the outstanding or dividend eligible shares, as appropriate, in each class of a Fund
at the beginning of each day. Operating expenses, which are attributable to all classes, will be allocated daily to
each class of shares based on the percentage of the Fund's net assets in each class at the beginning of the day. Expenses
that have a greater cost for one class than another (

i.e.

, rule 12b-1 fees and possibly transfer agent fees) will be charged separately to each class. Because of higher
ongoing distribution fees and potentially higher transfer agency fees paid by holders of the Deferred Option shares,
the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Deferred Option shares would be lower than the net income
attributable to and the dividends payable on Class A shares.

7. Class B shares may convert automatically to Class A shares after a specified period of years. In addition, for the
purposes of conversion, shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in
respect of Class B shares are also Class B shares, except that they will be considered held in a separate sub-account.
Each time a shareholder's Class B shares, other than those in the sub-account, convert to Class A, a 

pro rata

 portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account also will convert to Class A.

8. Applicants reserve the ability to convert shares of any class to shares of another, consistent with the standards,
policies, conditions, and representations set forth in the application regarding the conversion of Class B shares
to Class A shares. Such ability to convert shares will be subject to the terms fully disclosed in a Fund's registration
statement current at the time of sale, and will be at the relative net asset values of each of the classes.

9. The conversion feature is subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service private
letter ruling to the effect that such conversion of shares does not constitute a taxable event under federal income
tax law, and may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is not available.

10. Applicants anticipate that each class of shares may be exchanged for shares of the same class in another Fund to
the extent that the shareholder would have been eligible to purchase the shares acquired in the exchange. The exchange
privileges will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act.

11. Applicants expect that the CDSC applicable to Class B shares will vary from 2 percent to 5 percent for redemptions
made during the first year after purchase to 1 percent for redemptions made during the fourth year after purchase.
The CDSC applicable to Class B shares will not be imposed on redemptions of shares purchased more than six years prior
to their redemption.

12. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the
net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption. The CDSC of any particular Fund or class
thereof may be higher or lower than that described in the application. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares derived
from the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount
which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above
the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period.

13. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares
representing capital appreciation, next of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions,
and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if
any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate.

14. Applicants propose to waive the CDSC, in whole or in part, in connection with (a) redemptions made within one year
following the death or disability, as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b)(i) a lump sum or other distribution following retirement, or, in the case of
an individual retirement account (``IRA''), Keogh Plan, or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the
Code, after the shareholder has attained age 591/2, or any redemption resulting from a tax-free return of an excess
contribution pursuant to section 408(d) (4) or (5) of the Code, or from the death or disability of the employee, or (ii)
in the alternative, in connection with a distribution following retirement under a tax-deferred retirement plan,
or attaining age 701/2 in the case of an IRA, Keogh Plan, or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b) of the Code,
or resulting from the tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA; (c) redemptions of shares purchased by active
or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the Distributor or affiliated companies,
by members of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the Distributor, by
any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality, department, authority, or agency thereof and by trust companies
and bank trust departments which hold shares in a fiduciary capacity; (d) redemptions of shares made pursuant to a
shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (e) redemptions by shareholders
holding shares of a Fund worth over $1 million immediately prior to redemption; (f) redemptions effected by advisory
accounts managed by the Adviser; (g) redemptions by tax-exempt employee benefit plans resulting from the adoption
or promulgation of any law or regulation; and (h) redemptions effected by registered investment companies in connection
with the combination of an investment company with a Fund by merger, acquisition of assets, or by any other transaction.

15. If the Funds waive or reduce the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all offerees in the specified
class. If the Trustees of a Fund determine to discontinue the waiver or reduction of the CDSC, the disclosure in the
Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any shares purchased prior to the termination or reduction of such
waiver will be able to have the CDSC waived or reduced as provided in the Fund's prospectus at the time of the purchase
of such shares.

16. The Funds may provide a 

pro rata

 credit, to be paid for by the Distributor, for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment
effected within 365 days, or a shorter period, of the redemption.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System might be
deemed: (a) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g), and thus prohibited
by section 18(f)(1), and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). Applicants also seek an exemption
from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d), and rule 22c-1 to the extent necessary to permit the imposition
and waiver of a CDSC on redemptions of Fund shares.

2. Applicants believe that the proposal will permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities
and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting
and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. Applicants assert that, under the proposed Multi-Class
Distribution System, the Funds will save the organizational and other continuing costs that would be incurred if
the Funds were required to establish new separate investment portfolios.

3. Applicants believe that the Multi-Class Distribution System does not raise any of the concerns that prompted the
SEC to recommend the adoption of section 18, 

i.e.,

 excessive borrowing, inadequate assets or reserves, and increased speculative character of junior securities.
Applicants state that the proposal does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves.
In addition, applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Funds, since all such shares will participate 

pro rata

 in all of a Fund's appreciation, income and expenses, with the exception of the different distribution fees and any
different transfer agency costs payable by each class. Applicants contend that mutuality of risk will be preserved
with respect to each class of shares in a Fund.

4. Applicants assert that the proposed capital structures of the Funds will not induce any group of shareholders to
invest in risky securities to the detriment of any other group of shareholders because the investment risks of each
Fund will be borne equally by all of its shareholders. Moreover, applicants further assert that the proposed capital
structures will not enable insiders to manipulate the expenses and profits among the various classes of shares because
the Funds are not organized in a pyramid fashion, all expenses and profits of a Fund, other than the different class
expenses, will be borne 

pro rata

 by all shares of the Fund, and all shareholders will have equal voting rights, except concerning matters relating
to each class' rule 12b-1 plan.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely
to: (a) The impact of the respective rule 12b-1 plan payments made by each of the classes of shares of a Fund, any
higher incremental transfer agency costs attributable solely to the Deferred Option shares of a Fund, and any other
incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved
by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule
12b-1 distribution plan, except as provided in condition 4 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of
each class of shares; (d) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e) the designation
of each class of shares of a Fund.

2. The Trustees of each of the Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall have approved the Multi-Class
Distribution System, prior to the implementation of the Multi-Class Distribution System by a particular Fund. The
minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect
to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class Distribution System will reflect in detail the reasons for
determining that the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their
respective shareholders and such minutes will be available for inspection by the SEC staff.

3. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between or among the interests of the classes of
shares offered. The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor
at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.

4. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares (the ``Target Class'') under the plan, existing shares of a class of shares that converts
into the Target Class shares after a period of time (the ``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into the Target Class
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take
such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class
of shares (the ``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to
implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class.
If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing
Purchase Class shares for a new class (the ``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in
all material respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class
or the New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this
condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation.
In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the
New Target Class or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. The Purchase Class
shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into the Target Class shares subject to the higher
maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to
the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

5. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
rule 12b-1 plans relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and any incremental
transfer agency costs relating a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class.
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of income and expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent
Examiner'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such
methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate
manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will
monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render
at least annually a report to
