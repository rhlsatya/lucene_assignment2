Appendix A


Dear Officer, Agent, Representative, Employee, Distributor: The Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') has conducted
an investigation to determine whether Nu Skin International, Inc. (``Nu Skin''), and certain of its distributors
may have engaged in acts or practices which violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, as amended,
including, but not limited to, false and unsubstantiated product claims and earnings representations for Nu Skin
products and distributorships. As a result of its investigation, the FTC has alleged that Nu Skin, CJM, Inc., CST Management,
Inc., and CK&C, Inc., corporations; Clara McDermott, individually and as an officer and director of CJM, Inc.;
Craig Tillotson, individually and as an officer and director or CST Management, Inc.; and Craig Bryson, individually
and as an officer and director of CK&C, Inc., (herein collectively referred to as ``respondents''), have made
false and unsubstantiated representations in connection with the advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale,
and distribution of Nutriol Hair Fitness Preparation (``Nutriol''), Face Lift with Activator (``Face Lift''),
and Celltrex and the recruitment of Nu Skin distributors.
As a result of recent discussions with the FTC, the respondents have agreed to a Consent Order (``Order'') with the
FTC. The Order is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission of violations of law by any of the
respondents. Pursuant to the Order, the respondents have agreed not to make certain claims for the Nutriol, Face Lift,
and Celltrex products or any substantially similar products or services. In addition, the respondents have agreed
not to make certain claims for any other products or services unless they can substantiate those claims. The respondents
have also agreed not to make certain claims about the past or potential earnings of their distributors. Finally, the
respondents are obligated by the Order to discontinue dealing with any person who engages in the acts or practices
prohibited by the Order.
Specifically, the Order prohibits the respondents from claiming that:
1. Nutriol or any substantially similar product or service (a) can or will stop, prevent, cure, relieve, reverse or
reduce hair loss; (b) can or will promote the growth of hair where hair has already been lost; or (c) is as effective as,
or more effective than, the prescription drug Minoxidil in the treatment of hair loss;
2. Competent and reliable data show that Nutriol or any substantially similar product or service is effective in stopping
hair loss and promoting hair growth;

3. Face Lift or any substantially similar product or service (a) can or will permanently remove facial wrinkles; or
(b) is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Tretinoin (currently marketed as Retin-A) in
the removal of facial wrinkles; and

4. Celltrex or any substantially similar product or service will promote the healing of third degree burns.

In connection with any other product or service, the Order prohibits the respondents from representing:

1. That the product or service: (a) Can or will stop, prevent, cure, relieve, reverse or reduce hair loss; (ii) can or
will promote the growth of hair where hair has already been lost; (iii) is as effective as, or more effective than, any
other product or service in the treatment of hair loss; (iv) is as effective as, or more effective than, any other product
or service in the treatment of facial wrinkles; or (v) will promote the healing of, or is otherwise an effective treatment
for burns;

2. That competent and reliable data show that the product or service is effective in stopping hair loss and promoting
hair growth; and

3. The efficacy of the product or service in the treatment of facial wrinkles,




unless the claim is true and, at the time of making the claim, it possesses and relies upon competent and reliable scientific
evidence that substantiates the claim.



The Order also prohibits the respondents from advertising, packaging, labeling, promoting, offering for sale,
selling, or distributing any product that is represented as promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss, unless
the product is the subject of an approved new drug application for such purpose under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.

The Order also prohibits the respondents from making any representation regarding the performance, benefits, efficacy
or safety of any food, drug, or device unless at the time of making such representation respondents possess and rely
upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation. Similarly, the Order prohibits
the respondents from making any representation regarding the performance, benefits, efficacy or safety of any product
or service (other than any food, drug, or device), unless at the time of making such representation respondents possess
and rely upon competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific
evidence, that substantiates the representation.

Finally, the Order prohibits the respondents from:

1. Misrepresenting the past, present, or future profits, earnings, income, or sales of any person in any distribution,
sales or marketing plan; and

2. Representing that distributors earn or achieve any stated amount of profits, earnings, income, or sales in excess
of the average profits, earnings, income, or sales of all distributors unless in conjunction therewith the average
profits, earnings, income, or sales are clearly and conspicuously disclosed, and the percent of all distributors
who actually achieved such stated profits, earnings, income, or sales is clearly and conspicuously disclosed.

In addition to the Order's prohibitions, the Order requires the respondents to provide a copy of this notice to each
of their current and future officers, agents, representatives, employees, and distributors. The Order also requires
Nu Skin to discontinue dealing with any person who makes any of the representations for Nutriol, Face Lift, Celltrex,
or any substantially similar products or services, that are expressly prohibited by the Order. Nu Skin must also discontinue
dealing with any person who Nu Skin knows is engaged in any other acts or practices prohibited by the Order, unless the
person immediately ceases engaging in such acts or practices.

If you have any questions or would like a copy of the Order, you can contact us at [   ].



   Very truly yours,




[Respondent's name]

Analysis of the Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment




The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed Consent Order from Nu Skin International, Inc.,
CJM, Inc., CST Management, Inc., and CK&C, Inc., corporations; Clara McDermott, individually and as an officer
and director of CJM, Inc.; Craig Tillotson, individually and as an officer and director of CST Management, Inc.; and
Craig Bryson, individually and as an officer and director of CK&C, Inc.


The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for receipt of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed Order contained in the agreement.


This matter concerns advertisements and promotional practices for three Nu Skin International, Inc. products:
Nutriol Hair Fitness Preparation (``Nutriol''), Face Lift with Activator (``Face Lift''), and Celltrex. This matter
also concerns the advertisements and promotional practices for the recruitment of persons to be Nu Skin International,
Inc. distributors.


The Commission's proposed Complaint alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that Nutriol
will stop hair loss, stimulate hair growth, and is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Minoxidil
in the treatment of hair loss. These claims are alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15
U.S.C. 45, because they are false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claims
at the time they were made.


The proposed Complaint also alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that Face Lift will permanently
remove facial wrinkles and is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug trentinoin (currently
known as Retin-A) in the removal of facial wrinkles. These claims are alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because they are false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation
for the claims at the time they were made.


The proposed Complaint also alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that Celltrex will promote
the healing of third degree burns. This claim is alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15
U.S.C. 45, because it is false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim
at the time it was made.


The proposed Complaint also alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that the amount of money
represented in the advertisements is representative, or typical, of what individuals who become Nu Skin distributors
will generally achieve on a monthly or annual basis. This claim is alleged to violate section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, because it is false and the proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation
for the claim at the time it was made.


Finally, the proposed Complaint alleges that the advertisements expressly or impliedly claim that using Nutriol,
Face Lift, and Celltrex will result in physiological changes in the body, as well as cosmetic changes in appearance.
These claims are alleged to violate sections 5 and 12, 15 U.S.C. 45 and 52, because they are false advertisements which
induced, or will likely induce, the purchase of drugs or cosmetics.



The proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondents from representing, directly or by implication, that:
(1) Nutriol, or any substantially similar product or service, (a) can or will stop, prevent, cure, relieve, reverse
or reduce hair loss; (b) can or will promote the growth of hair where hair has already been lost; or (c) is as effective
as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Minoxidil in the treatment of hair loss; and (2) competent and reliable
data show that Nutriol, or any substantially similar product or service, is effective in stopping hair loss and promoting
hair growth. In addition, the proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondents from making these representations,
directly or by implication, for any other product or service, unless such representations are true and at the time
of making such representations, respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that
substantiates the representations. The proposed Consent Agreement also prohibits the proposed respondents from
advertising, packaging, labeling, promoting, offering for sale, selling, or distributing any product that is represented
as promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss, unless the product is the subject of an approved new drug application
for such purpose under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq

.

The proposed Consent Order also prohibits the proposed respondents from representing, directly or by implication,
that Face Lift, or any substantially similar product or service, (1) can or will permanently remove facial wrinkles;
or (2) is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Tretinoin (currently marketed as Retin-A)
in the removal of facial wrinkles. In addition, the proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondents from
representing, directly or by implication, the efficacy of any other product or service in the treatment of facial
wrinkles, or that such other product or service is as effective as, or more effective than, any other product or service
in the treatment of facial wrinkles, unless such representation is true and, at the time of making such representation,
respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation.

The proposed Consent Order also prohibits the proposed respondents from representing, directly or by implication,
that Celltrex, or any substantially similar product or service, can or will promote the healing of third degree burns.
In addition, the proposed Consent Order prohibits the proposed respondents from representing, directly or by implication,
that any other product or service will promote the healing of, or is otherwise an effective treatment for burns, unless
such representation is true and, at the time of making such representation, respondents possess and rely upon competent
and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation.

The proposed Consent Order also prohibits the proposed respondents from making any representation, directly or
by implication, (1) regarding the performance, benefits, efficacy or safety of any food, drug, or device, unless
at the time of making such representation respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence
that substantiates the representation; and (2) regarding the performance, benefits, efficacy or safety of any other
product or service, unless at the time of making such representation respondents possess and rely upon competent
and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates
the representation.

The proposed Consent Order also prohibits the proposed respondents from, (1) misrepresenting, in any manner, the
past, present, or future profits, earnings, income, or sales from participation of any person in any distribution,
sales, or marketing plan; and (2) representing, in any manner, directly or by implication, by use of hypothetical
examples or otherwise, that distributors earn or achieve from participation in any distribution, sales, or marketing
plan any stated amount of profits, earnings, income, or sales in excess of the average profits, earnings, income,
or sales of all distributors, unless in conjunction therewith such average profits, earnings, income, or sales are
clearly and conspicuously disclosed, and the percent of all distributors who actually achieved such stated profits,
earnings, income, or sales in such time period is clearly and conspicuously disclosed.


The proposed Consent Order also contains provisions requiring proposed respondent NU Skin International, Inc.,
to discontinue dealing with any person who makes any of the representations for Nutriol, Face Lift, Celltrex, or any
substantially similar products or services, that are expressly prohibited by the Order. Nu Skin must also discontinue
dealing with any person who Nu Skin knows is engaged in any other acts or practices prohibited by the Order, unless the
person immediately ceases engaging in such acts or practices.

The proposed Consent Order also contains provisions requiring distribution of the Order or a summary of the Order
to all current and future officers, agents, representatives, employees, and distributors of the proposed respondents;
record retention demonstrating compliance with the Order; and notification to the Commission of any changes in the
structure of the proposed corporate respondents or the employment of the individual respondents.

Finally, the proposed Consent Order requires proposed respondent Nu Skin International, Inc., to pay the Federal
Trade Commission $1,000,000, and proposed respondents CJM, Inc., CST Management, Inc., CK&C, Inc., Clara McDermott,
Craig Tillotson, and Craig Bryson to pay the Federal Trade Commission $225,000. The funds paid by the proposed respondents
shall, in the discretion of the Federal Trade Commission, be used to provide direct redress to consumers. If the Federal
Trade Commission determines that consumer redress is impracticable or otherwise unwarranted, any funds not so used
shall be paid to the United States Treasury.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment of the proposed Order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Opening of Land in a Proposed Withdrawal; California 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The temporary 2-year segregation of a proposed withdrawal of 110.00 acres of public land to protect the archaeological,
historical, and recreational integrity of the historic mining site of Dog Town expires on February 26, 1994, by operation
of law. The public land will become open to the operation of the public land laws, subject to valid existing rights,
the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. The
majority of the public land will remain segregated from location and entry under the public mining laws pursuant to
a previous segregation of record. The public land has been and will remain open to the mineral leasing laws. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A notice of Proposed Withdrawal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 27, 1992 (57 FR 6736), and corrected on April 7, 1992 (57 FR 11797), which segregated the land described
therein for up to 2 years from location and entry under the general land laws, including the mining laws, subject to
valid existing rights, but not from mineral leasing. The 2-year segregation expires February 26, 1994. The withdrawal
application will continue to be processed unless it is canceled or denied. The land is described as follows: 


Mount Diablo Meridian 


T. 4 N., R. 25 E., 


Sec. 26, W1/2SW1/4SW1/4; 
Sec. 27, E1/2SE1/4NE1/4SE1/4, SE1/4SE1/4; 
Sec. 34, N1/2NE1/4NE1/4, E1/2SE1/4NE1/4NE1/4; 
Sec. 35, W1/2NW1/4NW1/4.

 

The area described contains 110.00 acres in Mono County. 



At 10 a.m. on February 27, 1994, the land will be opened to location and entry under the United States general land laws,
including the mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, and other segregations
of record. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and
time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession
under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and
to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land
Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided
for such determinations in local courts. 
Under a previous segregation of record, the following described public land remained segregated as described below:



Mount Diablo Meridian 


T. 4 N., R. 25 E., 


Sec. 26, SW1/4SW1/4; 
Sec. 27, SE1/4SE1/4; 
Sec. 34, NE1/4NE1/4; 
Sec. 35, NW1/4NW1/4; 
Fifty feet either side of centerline of Virginia Creek beginning in NW1/4NW1/4 of sec. 35, T. 4 N., R. 25 E., thence southerly
through secs. 2, 11, and 14 of T. 3 N., R. 25 E., ending at the patented land in SW1/4SW1/4 of sec 14
