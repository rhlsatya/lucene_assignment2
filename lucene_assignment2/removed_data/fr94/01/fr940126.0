Extension of the Delegation of Authority for Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Requests 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farmers Home Administration, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this amendment to the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) regulations is to expand the delegation of
authority to include the Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Specialist and Management Analyst positions located
in the Freedom of Information/Torts Section at the National Office, and the State Administrative Officers/Administrative
Program Chiefs. This action is necessary due to a noticeable increase in Freedom of Information requests that must
be processed. The intended effect is to speed up the processing of the Freedom of Information Act requests.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



The State Directors, District Directors, County Supervisors and the Freedom of Information Officer are the only
positions currently delegated authority to respond to requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). During
the last several years there has been a noticeable increase in FOIA requests made to FmHA. To speed up processing these
requests, it will be necessary to expand the delegation of authority to include the Administrative 
Officers and Administrative Program Chief for each state and two additional professional positions, Freedom of
Information/Privacy Act Specialist and Management Analyst, located in the FmHA Freedom of Information/Torts Section
at the National Office. 



Classification 



This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures which implement Executive Order 12886. The action is exempt from
those requirements because it involves only internal Agency management. While it is USDA policy to publish for comment
rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C.
553 with respect to such rules, this action involves only internal Agency management. Therefore, publication for
comment is unnecessary. 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 2018 



Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information.




Accordingly, part 2018 of chapter XVIII, title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows: 



PART 2018_GENERAL

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 Series Airplanes 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11
series airplanes. This action requires an inspection to detect chafing damage to certain wiring in the main avionics
rack, repair or replacement of damaged wiring, and modification of the wiring installation. This amendment is prompted
by a report of a chafed wire harness found on the main avionics rack on one airplane that resulted in arcing damage to
the wire harness and adjacent structure. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent chafing of the main
avionics rack wiring, which could result in arcing and a fire in the wire bundle; this could lead to damage to aircraft
systems and loss of associated aircraft functions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Recently, one operator of McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes reported one instance of the auto
ground spoiler failing to arm on one airplane. Investigation revealed two wires that had burnt in half and several
charred wires on shelf 3 of the aft section of the main avionics rack. These wires apparently had chafed and shorted
on the screws that attach the wire bundle trough assembly to the rack. Additionally, the protective tape was worn from
the attach screw heads. The operator then conducted a fleet inspection and found additional wire chafing at the same
location on another airplane. The operator also found worn protective tape (exposed screw heads) at various locations
on the avionics racks on other airplanes. Chafing of the wiring in the main avionics rack, if not detected and corrected
in a timely manner, could result in arcing and a fire in the wire bundle; this could lead to damage to aircraft systems
and the loss of associated aircraft functions. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Alert Service Bulletin A24-75, dated December
22, 1993, that describes procedures for performing a visual inspection to detect chafing damage to the wire harness
located on the aft side of the main avionics rack on shelves 1 through 4. It also describes procedures for repairing
or replacing damaged wiring, and modifying the wiring installation by bonding nylon sheets between the wire harnesses
and the protective tape on the screw heads. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model MD-11 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent chafing of the main avionics rack wiring, which could result
in arcing and fire in the wire bundle, and lead to damage to aircraft systems and the subsequent loss of associated aircraft
functions. This AD requires a detailed visual inspection to detect chafing damage to the wire harnesses located on
the aft side of the main avionics rack on shelves 1 through 4. Any damaged wiring must be replaced or repaired prior to
further flight. Additionally, operators are required to modify the wiring installation by bonding nylon sheets
between the wire harnesses and the protective tape on the screw heads. The actions are required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
This is considered interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider additional
rulemaking. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-NM-231-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Orthoarsenic Acid; Revocation of Tolerance 







<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes the tolerance in 40 CFR 180.180 for residues of the pesticide orthoarsenic acid (commonly known
as arsenic acid) in or on the raw agricultural commodity cottonseed. EPA is initiating this action because all registered
uses of arsenic acid on cotton have been canceled.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

: In the 

Federal Register

 of September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49267), EPA issued a proposal to revoke the tolerance for arsenic acid on cottonseed because
the use of arsenic acid on cotton was voluntarily canceled. A previous notice in the 

Federal Register

 of May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26975) had acknowledged that existing stocks of Elf Atochem North America and Voluntary Purchasing
Groups arsenic acid products could be sold until October 31, 1993, and applied by end users until December 31, 1993.
Because use will continue through the end of 1993, all treated raw cottonseed may not clear processing mills and feed
markets until July 1, 1995. Therefore, to effect the revocation, EPA proposed to establish an expiration date for
the tolerance of July 1, 1995. EPA predicts there will be an insignificant or no economic impact from revoking this
tolerance because EPA is allowing ample time for legally treated commodities, i.e., treated prior to December 31,
1993, to pass through the channels of trade. 


EPA believes that arsenic acid is not used on cotton grown in other countries and imported into the United States. Once
the tolerance for arsenic acid on cottonseed is revoked, it will be unlawful to import into the United States any cottonseed
treated with arsenic acid.
After legally treated cottonseed has cleared the market, residues of arsenic acid resulting from pesticide application
are not expected to be detected. Therefore, action levels to cover residues of arsenic acid from past uses of the pesticide
will not be recommended. 
No public comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the proposed rule.
Therefore, based on the information considered by the Agency and discussed in detail in the September 22, 1993 proposal
and in this final rule, the Agency is hereby revising 40 CFR 180.180 for residues of orthoarsenic acid to stipulate
that the 4-ppm tolerance for orthoarsenic acid in or on cottonseed expires on July 1, 1995.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation revoking the tolerance may, within 30 days after publication of
this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of any objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for
this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and
the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i).
If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested,
the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested
claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would
be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
The Agency believes that the domestic use of arsenic acid is limited and will end this year with the voluntary cancellation
and termination of the provision for sale and use of existing stocks. Further, its use, if any, on imported commodities
is insignificant. Since the tolerance is being revoked 18 months after the last legal domestic use on cotton, impacts
are expected to be minimal.
For those reasons, pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant''
and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act


This rulemaking has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq.

), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses,
small governments, or small organizations. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed in the September 22, 1993
proposal.

Vinyl Acetate-Ethylene Copolymer; Tolerance Exemption






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of vinyl acetate-ethylene
copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 24937-78-8) when used as an inert ingredient (component of water-soluble film) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops only. This regulation was requested by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62072), EPA issued a proposed rule giving notice that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
7201 Hamilton, Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195-1501, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E4275 to EPA proposing to
amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d) to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of vinyl acetate-ethylene
copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 24937-78-8) when used as an inert ingredient (component of water-soluble film) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops only.


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted with the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
