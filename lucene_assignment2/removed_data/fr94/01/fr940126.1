Full Disclosure of Beneficiary's Income and Assets




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Action is being taken to amend Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations to reflect changes in the law which
require certain fiduciaries of incompetent beneficiaries of veterans' benefits to report non-VA income in conjunction
with required formal or informal accountings. Under current regulation, fiduciaries recognized by VA are not required
to divulge non-VA income and assets that the fiduciary may be holding on behalf of incompetent VA beneficiaries. These
amendments will permit implementation of the law, allow for a greater degree of protection of the income and estates
of incompetent VA beneficiaries and reduce the incidence of waste, fraud and abuse of VA benefits by certain Federal
fiduciaries, and court-appointed fiduciaries.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 99-576, section 505 amended 38 U.S.C. 5502(b) (formerly 38 U.S.C. 3202(b)) to permit the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs to require a fiduciary to disclose, as part of the accounting process, any financial information
which is available to the fiduciary concerning the non-VA income and assets of an incompetent beneficiary of VA benefits.
The particular regulations to be amended deal specifically with the responsibilities of Federal fiduciaries and
court-appointed fiduciaries, and the authority of the Veterans Services Officers at VA Regional Offices to request
an accounting from a fiduciary. Each regulation would be amended to include the requirement that non-VA income and
assets be subject to inclusion in VA requested formal or informal accountings.



These changes will greatly enhance VA's ability to prevent waste, fraudulent use or abuse of the VA benefits of an incompetent
beneficiary by the VA recognized fiduciary. The changes will permit VA to formalize a procedure that has only been
informal and unenforceable in the past, namely the request for a total accounting of income and assets managed by a
fiduciary.


The Paperwork Reduction Act


These regulatory amendments contain new information collection requirements as VA will be requiring fiduciaries
to provide a type of information which we have not previously required. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork
Reduction Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request
that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments
for consideration by OMB on this proposed information collection requirement should address them to the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention:
Joseph F. Lackey.
The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612.
Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulatory amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory
flexibility analyses requirements of   603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that the additional
information fiduciaries are being asked to provide is that which they already have but have not previously provided,
requiring no additional data collection. In addition, the number of fiduciaries who will be reporting additional
income to comply with the proposed change is expected to be only 1% or approximately 300 of the approximately 30,000
fiduciaries who submit accountings.
There is no Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number.

including all information available to the fiduciary concerning the beneficiary's income and estate derived from
non-Department of Veterans Affairs sources.

Acid Rain Program: Permits and Allowance System Proposed Regulations; Change in Public Comment Period for the Proposed
Revisions to the Rules





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules; change in public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 18, 1993, EPA published proposed regulations revising 40 CFR parts 72 and 73, the Permits and Allowance
System rules of the Acid Rain Program. The original comment period for the proposal was to have ended January 3, 1994.
By notice published on December 30, 1993, EPA extended the public comment period to end on January 19, 1994. In response
to requests from interested parties, EPA is again extending the public comment period, which will end on February
10, 1994. In addition to the questions set forth in the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA is requesting
that commenters address whether and, if so, under what circumstances allowances allocated by EPA to substitution
or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations would be given back to EPA at some future date.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA requested comment on whether certain substitution plans
and reduced utilization plans with compensating units should be approved, and allowances allocated to approved
substitution and compensating units, for 1995 under the January 11, 1993 regulations and whether action on these
compliance options for 1996-99 should be deferred pending completion of the instant rulemaking proceeding.
Comment was also requested concerning whether approval of these compliance options should be for some shorter or
longer period, with action on them for the remaining portion of Phase I being deferred.



In extending the public comment on this and other requests for comment set forth in the November 18, 1993 proposal,
EPA notes that interested parties have requested that the Agency seek additional comment concerning whether any
allowances allocated by EPA to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations should
be returned to EPA at some future time. Consequently, EPA requests such comment. If commenters maintain that a return
of allowances should be required, the commenters should discuss what should be the period during which allowances
may be retained (e.g., how many years) and when that period should begin. For example, the allowances could be allocated
to a unit's Allowance Tracking System account for one or more years in Phase I and at the same time an equivalent number
of allowances could be deducted from the Allowance Tracking System account for one or more future years. As an alternative,
the deduction from the account for one or more future years could be made as the allowances are used or transferred.

Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs); Notice of Informal Hearing on the Reclassification of PCB and PCB-Contaminated
Transformers 



 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Informal Hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 18, 1993 EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics published a proposed rule to amend the requirements
that govern the reclassification of certain PCB and PCB-Contaminated Transformers to a lower regulatory status
as a PCB-Contaminated (

;

50 to 

<

500 ppm PCBs) or a Non-PCB (

<

50 ppm PCBs) Transformer. In that notice, EPA said it would hold an informal hearing if requested. EPA received a request
for a hearing on the proposed rule from the Electric Apparatus Service Association (EASA). Therefore, EPA will hold
a half-day informal, public hearing. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The procedures for rulemaking under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are identified in 40 CFR part
750, subpart A. The following summarizes the procedures and logistics associated with this informal hearing pursuant
to 40 CFR part 750. Participants and/or commenters are advised to see 40 CFR part 750 for greater detail. 



Each person or organization desiring to participate in the informal hearing shall file a written request to participate
with the OPPT Document Control Officer, TSCA Docket Receipts (see 

ADDRESSES 

above). The request shall be received on or before February 16, 1994. The request shall include: (1) A brief statement
of the interest of the person or organization in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3)
an estimate of the time required; and (4) if the request comes from an organization, a nonbinding list of the persons
to take part in the presentation. An organization that has not filed main comments on the rulemaking will not be allowed
to participate in the hearing, unless a waiver of this requirement is granted by the Record and Hearing Clerk (see ADDRESSES
above) or the organization is appearing at the request of EPA or under subpoena (40 CFR 750.6(a)).

A panel of EPA employees shall preside at the hearing, and one panel member will chair the proceedings. The panel may
question any individual or group participating in the hearing on any subject relating to the rulemaking. Cross-examination
will normally not be permitted at this stage. However, persons in the hearing audience may submit questions in writing
for the hearing panel to ask the participants, and the hearing panel may, at their discretion, ask these questions
(40 CFR 750.7(a) and (b)). See 40 CFR 750.7(c) for the rule governing the submission of additional material by the hearing
participants.

After the close of the hearing, any participant in the hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination.
The request shall be received by EPA no later than 1 week after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available (to
determine when the transcript is available, interested persons may contact the Environmental Assistance Division
(see 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

above)). See 40 CFR 750.8 for a description of the information that shall be included in such a request.

Interested persons may file reply comments. Reply comments shall be received on or before March 23, 1994, and shall
be restricted to comments on: (1) Other comments; (2) material in the hearing record; and (3) material which was not
and could not possibly have been available to the commenting party a sufficient time before main comments were due
on January 3, 1994. (40 CFR 750.4(a) and (b)). Extensions of time for filing reply comments may be granted pursuant

Acetophenone, Phenol, N,N-Dimethylaniline, Ethyl Acetate and 2,6- Dimethylphenol; Proposed Test Rule Correction
and Extension of Public Comment Period



 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; correction and extension of public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is extending the public comment period for 30 days, from January 21, 1994 to February 22, 1994, and correcting a
proposed test rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61654) requiring manufacturers and processors of five chemicals (acetophenone, phenol,
N,N-dimethylaniline, ethyl acetate, and 2,6-dimethylphenol) to conduct testing for certain chemical fate, health
and environmental effects. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Extension of Comment Period 



On November 22, 1993, EPA promulgated a proposed rule, 40 CFR 799.4450, that would require testing of five chemicals
for certain chemical fate, health and environmental effects under section 4(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA). The chemicals and their chemical-specific docket numbers are: acetophenone, 42150A/42151A; phenol, 42150A/42152A;
N,N- dimethylaniline, 42150A/42153A; ethyl acetate, 42150A/42141B; and 2,6-dimethylphenol, 42150A/42154A.
EPA has received requests from the Chemical Manufacturers Association for a 30-day extension of the comment
period and from the General Electric Company for a 90-day extension. EPA believes that providing an additional
30-day period to prepare written comments is reasonable, and EPA is extending the written comment period for
the proposed test rule until February 22, 1994.
