Business Development Center Applications: Little Rock MBDC





<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting competitive
applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance for the
first budget period (12 months) from June 1, 1994 to May 31, 1995 is estimated at $169,125. The application must include
a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing contributions
may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof. The MBDC will
operate in the Little Rock, Arkansas geographic service area.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDC funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
businesses.



Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to any one evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Finally award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated
responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program.
Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result
in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily
receive the award.



MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project costs through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. The collection of information requirements for this project have
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006. Questions

Notice of receipt two applications for scientific research permits (P497B, P503M).









Notice is hereby given that the Idaho Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (ICFWRU) (P497B) and the Idaho Department
of Fish and Game (IDFG) (P503M) have both applied in due form for a permit to take listed species of Snake River salmon
as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing
listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-227).

ICFWRU (P497B) requests authorization to lethally take juvenile listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon
(

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

) from bypass-collection facilities at the Lower Granite Dam in order to determine the physiological effects of collection,
bypass, and transport on wild fish. ICFWRU requests authorization to conduct this research from April 15, to June
1, 1994.

IDFG (P503M) requests authorization to take adult and juvenile listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon.
IDFG proposes to enumerate and collect length information on upstream migrant adult chinook salmon in Chamberlain
Creek and West Fork Chamberlain Creek. They would also conduct parr density monitoring by snorkeling, conduct redd
counts, and collect biological information from carcasses. The latter activities are ongoing, and were previously
covered by Permit 823. However, IDFG proposes to combine activities specific to the Chamberlain Basin into a single
permit. IDFG requests authorization to conduct this research from March 1 through November 30 annually through 1997.

Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on these applications should be submitted to the Director,
Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Hwy., Silver Spring, MD 20910,
within 30 days of the publication of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set forth the specific
reasons why a hearing on the particular application would be appropriate. The holding of such hearing is at the discretion
of the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries. All statements and opinions contained in these application summaries
are those of the applicant and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.


Documents submitted in connection with the above application are available for review by interested persons in the

Finding of No Significant Impact: Interim Storage of Plutonium 
Components at the Pantex Plant, Amarillo, TX




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Finding of No Significant Impact for the Interim Storage of Plutonium Components at the Pantex Plant. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq., 

the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1500


et seq., 

and the United States Department of Energy's implementing procedures, 10 CFR 1021, the Department of Energy has prepared
an Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA-0812, January 1994) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts
of increased interim storage of plutonium components (pits) at the Pantex Plant located in Carson County about 17
miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas. 



The Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential environmental impacts of interim storage of up to 20,000 pits
at the Pantex Plant until decisions can be implemented on the long-term storage of plutonium required for national
security purposes and on the disposition of surplus plutonium. In response to comments received from State and local
officials and other stakeholders, the Department has decided to store no more than 12,000 pits at Pantex until it completes
a site-wide environmental impact statement covering all current and proposed facilities and activities at Pantex.
A Record of Decision for this environmental impact statement will be issued by November 15, 1996. The Department's
interim storage decision will enable approximately three more years of nuclear weapons dismantlement activities
at Pantex. The Department now envisions that the Pantex Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement will address all
storage requirements, including alternative locations, for all plutonium, highly enriched uranium, tritium,
and classified weapons components that result from Pantex dismantlement activities. Scoping meetings for this
Environmental Impact Statement will be held in Amarillo, Texas, and at other sites that might be affected by the activities
at Pantex by June 30, 1994. In addition, the Reconfiguration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement is scheduled
to be completed in 1995. It will analyze all reasonable long-term pit storage alternatives and discuss the disposition
options the Department is considering, and the Record of Decision will include decisions on pit storage locations.
The Pantex Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement will take into account any decisions resulting from the Reconfiguration
Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. 

The Department of Energy provided a pre-approval review copy of the Environmental Assessment to the State of Texas
in December 1992. Subsequently, the State provided the pre-approval Environmental Assessment to interested and
affected members of the public. State and public comments were submitted to the Department for consideration during
February and March, 1993. In response to these comments, the Department reviewed and revised the Environmental Assessment
and added a Comment Response Document. This revised pre-approval Environmental Assessment was issued on November
11, 1993, for public review and comment. 
The Department then held a public meeting on December 6, 1993, in Amarillo, Texas, to discuss the revised Environmental
Assessment and Comment Response Document and to respond to comments from State and local officials and the public.
Subsequent to the public meeting, the Department accepted written comments on the revised pre-approval Environmental
Assessment until December 20, 1993. The Environmental Assessment was expanded to include the Department's response
to the comments received on the revised Environmental Assessment. 

Based upon the analyses in the Environmental Assessment and after careful consideration of all comments from State
and local officials and members of the public, the Department of Energy has determined that storage of no more than
12,000 pits at Pantex does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. Therefore, an environmental impact statement
is not required and the Department issues this Finding of No Significant Impact.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Pantex Plant is located in Carson County, about 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas, and central to the panhandle
of Texas. As a component of the national nuclear weapons research, development, and production complex administered
by the Department of Energy, the primary mission of Pantex is the assembly, disassembly, and surveillance of nuclear
weapons. Within the disassembly portion of the Department of Energy mission, weapons are returned to Pantex from
the Department of Defense, disassembled and the plutonium pits stored at Pantex. 



Two factors combine to create the need for increased interim storage of pits. First, decisions to reduce the size of
the nuclear weapons stockpile have accelerated the accumulation of pits. These pits need to be stored on an interim
basis until decisions can be implemented on the long-term storage of plutonium required for national security purposes
and on the disposition of surplus plutonium. 

Second, pits are no longer being shipped from Pantex to the Rocky Flats Plant, near Golden, Colorado, to be recycled.
This function was temporarily halted at the Rocky Flats Plant in 1989 to make improvements in the operations and facilities.
In January 1992, pit recycle operations were suspended indefinitely. Subsequently, the Department has decided
to no longer maintain a nuclear component production capability at the Rocky Flats Plant. 



Proposed Action Described in the Environmental Assessment and Decision:

 The proposed action as described in the Environmental Assessment was to provide additional storage beyond the present
pit storage capacity (6,800 pits) for up to 20,000 pits for an interim time period. In response to comments received
from State and local officials and other stakeholders, the Department has decided to increase the interim storage
of pits at Pantex under this Finding of No Significant Impact to no more than 12,000 pits. There would not be a need to
construct or demolish any additional facilities; nor would there be any increased generation or management of wastes,
uncontained plutonium handling, or plutonium processing as a result of this decision. The Department will implement
this decision in the same manner as described in the proposed action for storage of 20,000 pits with one exception,
the number of magazines that will be utilized. Approximately 31 magazines will be used instead of 49. The operations
will remain the same in that inspections and inventories of pits will be carried out in the same manner, the method of
storage will remain as described in the proposed action, and the number of pits stored in each magazine will remain
the same. 

Two types of magazines exist at Pantex. There are 18 Modified-Richmond magazines, and 42 Steel Arch Construction
magazines. Currently, Steel Arch Construction magazines are not utilized for pit storage. Dismantlement activities
at Pantex will continue and pit storage will be expanded to include the Zone 4 Steel Arch Construction magazines consistent
with the Environmental Assessment and the Final Safety Analysis Report for Zone 4 and all magazines will use the preferred
interim storage configurations in the Environmental Assessment. The preferred interim storage configurations
are either multiple stacking of containers placed horizontally on pallets or a single layer of containers placed
vertically on the floor with aisles to facilitate access for inventory and surveillance activities. Because of its
overall advantages, storage eventually will be accomplished using the multiple stacked configuration. After successful
completion of the Department's Operational Readiness Review for horizontal stacking, scheduled for mid-February
1994, storage using this configuration will begin. Until then, storage will be undertaken using the vertical configuration
previously described. The number of pits that could be held within each of the 18 Modified-Richmond magazines will
increase from 378 pits to a maximum of 440 as accomplished by using a horizontal palletized multiple stacking configuration.
In addition, each Steel Arch Construction magazine will hold up to 384 or 392 pits, in the vertical single-layer or
horizontal palletized multiple stacking configurations, respectively.

These two configurations represent the limiting cases for the numbers of pits held in a single Modified-Richmond
or Steel Arch Construction magazine. In the vertical configuration, individual pit containers may rest on casters
rather than on the concrete floor of magazines. This will facilitate inventory operations and worker safety, and
accommodate operational needs. In addition, some Steel Arch Construction magazines will be reserved for assembled
weapons and component staging activities that have taken place in the past, and will continue in these facilities.


Each pit is clamped in a holding fixture and inserted in a storage container comprised of a carbon or stainless steel
drum lined with a nominal three inches of insulating and cushioning material. The pallets for the horizontal multiple
stacking configuration are designed to ensure structural integrity and stability. An electric forklift with shielding
for radiation protection will be used for storage, retrieval, and inventory operations for the horizontal palletized
stacking configuration. The shielded forklift has a passive guidance system (e.g., rail guides, wire guides, etc.,),
which prevents the forklift from veering from the aisle, and is equipped with a lateral motion, turret-type fork assembly,
which allows palletized pit containers to be stacked and retrieved. 



Alternatives: 

The Environmental Assessment considers the alternatives of No Action, Combination of the Proposed Action Storage
at Pantex with Storage at Other Department of Energy Sites (Savannah River Site, Los Alamos National Laboratory,
and the Hanford Site), Supplement No-Action Alternative Storage Capacity with Storage at Other Department of Energy
Sites, and Interim Storage at a Department of Defense Facility. Based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment,
none of the alternatives would provide sufficient increased interim storage capacity for pits while continuing
disassembly operations at the anticipated rate, and none would meet other programmatic objectives, i.e., to provide
an approach that is timely and cost effective and utilizes to the maximum extent practicable existing facilities
and infrastructures. 



Environmental Impacts: Routine Operating Conditions: 

Under normal operating conditions, the storage of up to 12,000 pits would result in only minor releases of air pollutants
associated with equipment engines and a minor increase in particulates (dust) associated with forklift operations
in moving security blocks and pit containers to the magazines. There would be no impact to water resources, flood plains,
wetlands, cultural resources, or other site features. No new facilities are required to increase storage capacity.
Consequently, there would be no environmental impact due to the need for construction or significant modification
of facilities. 

The primary impact of routine operations is occupational radiation exposure to workers involved in placement of
pits into storage and periodic inspections and inventories of pits stored on an interim basis. Increasing the number
of pits from 6,000 to 12,000 will increase the estimated cumulative personnel exposure by approximately 14 percent
(from 67.8 person-rem per year as reflected in Appendix F of the Environmental Assessment to approximately 80.4 person-rem
per year). For all operations at the Pantex Plant, worker radiation doses are maintained below the annually established
Pantex operating limit of 1 rem per year. This limit is well below the federally mandated limit of 5 rem per year. Limiting
the number of pits stored at Pantex on an interim basis to a maximum of 12,000 pits would reduce the cumulative Personnel
Exposure (person-rem/yr) estimated to occur from the proposed action in Appendix F of the Environmental Assessment
from 92.4 person-rem per year to 80.4 person-rem per year. The reduction would result from reducing the total number
of magazines inventoried on an annual basis from 40 magazines per year to 24 magazines per year. The handling procedures
and rate of fill of the magazines described in the Environmental Assessment remain unchanged. Individual exposures
would be maintained well within Federal and Department guidelines. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring that doses
to workers will be minimized through implementation of ``As Low As Reasonably Achievable'' practices. 

Additionally, the level of penetrating radiation expected to result from storage of up to 12,000 pits would result
in no measurable effect on exposure to an individual occupying a position for an entire year at the nearest Pantex site
boundary. Such a level would be indistinguishable from natural background radiation. No adverse health effects
would be expected among the general public as a result of routine operations from this action. 



Abnormal Events/Accidents: 

The Department of Energy analyzed a series of potential accidents in the Environmental Assessment. By using conservative
assumptions (i.e., those that tend to overestimate potential impacts), the Department of Energy attempted to bound
all reasonably foreseeable adverse impacts. The Department of Energy analyzed impacts from abnormal events 
having a probability of occurrence of greater than one in a million (1 x 10

^6

).

<TEXT>
 

Potential accident-initiating events considered in the Safety Analysis Report of the Zone 4 magazines were reviewed
for potential impact. Included were earthquakes, external explosions, forklift accidents, missiles, tornados,
and aircraft crashes. The potential for consequences for an abnormal event/accident range from negligible to marginal.
No consequences to the public or the environment would be anticipated. The workers in the immediate vicinity of the
accident site could receive a marginal radiation dose. An analysis performed of the likelihood of an aircraft crash
into a Modified-Richmond or Steel Arch Construction magazine in Zone 4 indicated an annual probability of less than
1 x 10

-6

 per year. 

Because the Ogallala Aquifer is the primary water source for most of the Texas Panhandle, and in response to the expressed
interest of State and local officials and the public regarding possible contamination of the aquifer, the Department
of Energy performed additional analyses on potential impacts to the aquifer. The analyses describe the potential
for aquifer contamination should plutonium be released to the environment within an 80-km radius of the Pantex Plant.
No accident or routine operating condition with a probability greater than 1 x 10

-6

 was identified that could result in a plutonium release having an impact on the Ogallala Aquifer. In the unlikely event
of an accident that resulted in a release of plutonium, it is expected that the majority of the radioactivity (90 percent)
deposited on the soil surface would remain in that top layer of soil. Because plutonium is relatively immobile in soils
similar to those found at and near the Pantex site, no effects to the Ogallala Aquifer would be expected. 



Determination:

 Based upon the analyses in the Environmental Assessment, and after careful consideration of comments received,
the Department of Energy has determined that the storage of no more than 12,000 pits at Pantex does not constitute a
major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an Environmental
Impact Statement is not required and the Department issues this Finding of No Significant Impact. 

Any new Finding of No Significant Impact, if that should prove necessary, that relies on the Environmental Assessment
for Interim Storage of Plutonium Components at the Pantex Plant will be issued only after consultation with State
and affected stakeholders regarding DOE's views of the need for a revised Finding of No Significant Impact and after
a public meeting in Amarillo to consider the proposed Finding of No Significant Impact. If a new Finding of No Significant
Impact is issued, it will respond to comments received during the consultation and public meeting process.

Arthropod Pheromones in Solid Matrix Dispensers; Experimental Use Permits 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing in this notice that it is expanding the acreage cut-off for when an Experimental Use Permit (EUP)
is required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) from 10 acres to 250 acres for a
class of biological pesticides. This class of pesticides covers arthropod pheromone products in solid matrix dispensers
used at rates at or below a total use rate of 150 grams active ingredient (AI)/acre/year. Tests conducted on these pheromone
formulations under the conditions specified in this notice would not require an EUP at acreages up to and including
250 acres. Tests conducted on acreages exceeding 250 acres would require an EUP. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction 


In keeping with the Administrator's commitment to reduce the use of higher risk pesticides and provide incentives
for the adoption of lower-risk pest management methods, EPA is announcing in this notice a new policy of allowing testing
of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers (e.g., twist ties, plastic tapes, and ropes) on no more than 250 acres to proceed
without an EUP. EPA recognizes that alternative pest control strategies, integrated pest management, and reduced
risk pesticides, such as pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, are fundamental elements of an overall program to
reduce risks to humans and the environment. 
Insect species utilize certain volatile compounds, semiochemicals, and pheromones, to communicate with each other
(e.g., to locate and attract mates or give alarm). For purposes of this notice, EPA defines a semiochemical as a chemical
that transmits messages between living organisms. A pheromone, which is a type of semiochemical, is defined as a compound
produced by an arthropod which, alone or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other
individuals of the same species (40 CFR 152.25(b)(1)). Even very low amounts of these naturally occurring volatile
compounds can confuse normal insect behavior thus interrupting mating and preventing reproduction. These chemicals
may pose a relatively low risk alternative for managing insect pest populations. The use of semiochemicals, including
pheromones, to attract and trap insects has been a viable pest management technology for a considerable period of
time. In 1979, EPA first registered pheromones for use in traps for the purpose of mass trapping Japanese Beetles.
Since then, the Agency has registered approximately 30 semiochemical pesticides with approximately 20 active ingredients
being Lepidoptera pheromones. 
It was in the late 1970s that EPA recognized that biochemical pesticides, including pheromones, were inherently
different from most broad spectrum conventional pesticides and encouraged their development and registration,
considering them to be potentially lower risk alternatives to conventional synthetic products on the market. The
development of reduced safety data requirements currently in place for the registration of biochemical pesticides
is based on the Agency's classification of a biochemical pesticide by two criteria: (1) The compound's non-toxic
mode of action on the target pest, and (2) the natural occurrence of the compound. While not criteria for biochemical
classification, arthropod pheromone products also have a low use rate, usually below 20 grams per acre, and target
species specificity, therefore less expected environmental impact than other pesticides. 
The conditions under which an EUP, the first step in the regulation process, is required and the data which is required
for an EUP application are major areas of concern by researchers and producers of pheromone pesticide products. A
1987 survey of companies actively involved in the registration of pheromones and companies that have considered
and rejected pheromone development indicated that industry considered data requirements for pheromones to be excessive
given the relatively safe nature of these substances, their extremely low rate of application, and their short persistence.
Furthermore, it was noted that the applicant must incur the costs of developing most of the data to obtain an EUP, a stage
in the product's development often too early to tell whether the pheromone is viable as a pesticide product. Given
the limited earning potential of pheromone products, such testing costs tend to be prohibitively expensive; this
is in addition to the high initial production costs of the pheromones themselves. 
Over the years, industry has suggested several changes in EPA rules and procedures to aid the development and ease
the regulatory standards for pheromones and similar semiochemicals. The Agency is now at a point where it believes
there is a sufficient body of information in the public literature and has adequate data available on arthropod pheromones,
and is now taking steps toward this end. 
Today's notice announces a new agency policy of allowing pheromones in solid matrix dispensers to be tested on acreages
not exceeding 250 acres of land under the conditions specified in this notice without an EUP. This policy only applies
to arthropod pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, as defined in this notice, applied at rates not to exceed 150 grams
AI/acre/year. 
Conditional relief consisting of exemption from regulation under FIFRA has previously been granted by EPA for pheromone
traps in which the pheromones are the sole active ingredient(s) (See 40 CFR 152.25(b)). In addition, EPA, on its own
initiative, issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538), which proposes to exempt
from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) the residues of arthropod
pheromones resulting from the use of these substances in solid matrix dispensers with an annual application rate
limitation of 150 grams AI/acre/year for pest control in or on all raw agricultural commodities. The scope of pheromone
products exempted by this tolerance proposal would be the same as the scope of products subject to this notice. EPA
currently is considering whether to take additional actions to grant further regulatory relief for other types of
pheromone products. If EPA determines that any such regulatory relief is warranted, EPA would announce such a decision
in a future 

Federal Register

 notice.



II. Statutory and Regulatory Authority 


Section 5 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136c and 40 CFR part 172 provide for issuance by the Agency of EUP's for the testing of new,
unregistered, pesticides or registered pesticides being tested for new uses, in which the purpose is only to determine
its value for pesticide purposes or to determine its toxicity or other properties. Such permits are generally issued
for large-scale testing of pesticides on more than 10 acres. Contained within the scope of the regulation, however,
is the presumption that small-scale testing, i.e., on not more than 10 acres of land, does not require an EUP provided
that the crops are destroyed or an appropriate tolerance is in place (40 CFR 172.3(a)). This presumption, however,
is caveated not to preclude experimental testing on larger areas in certain circumstances where the purpose of the
large acreage test is only to determine the substance's value for pesticidal purposes or to determine its toxicity
or other properties, and no benefit from pest control is expected (40 CFR 172.3(b)). EPA issued in the 

Federal Register

 of January 22, 1993 (58 FR 5878), a proposed amendment to 40 CFR part 172. The proposed amendment would, among other
things, modify  172.3 to clarify that the determination of whether an EUP is required is based on risk considerations.
The amendment would provide that tests conducted on not more than 10 acres of land are presumed not to involve unreasonable
risks, and therefore, do not require an EUP. 
EPA believes that pheromone products in solid matrix dispensers must be tested at acreages larger than 10 acres and
as large as 250 acres to determine the products' value for pesticidal purposes. The 10 acre presumption in 40 CFR 172.3(a)
is appropriate for most substances, which can be tested to determine their value for pesticidal purposes at small
acreages below 10 acres. Due to the unique characteristics of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, however, these
products must be tested at much larger acreages. Most pheromone uses involve mating disruption. Unlike traditional
toxicants which usually focus on killing the immature insect (which often does the most damage), pheromones act upon
the adult. 
Insects use pheromones to locate potential mates. When pheromones are introduced over an area by man as a pest control
technique, the insects become confused by the seemingly ubiquitous presence of the guiding compound and therefore
cannot find a suitable mate. When successful, pheromone applications result in reduced mating, lower insemination
rates, and therefore lower population densities in the next generation. The evaluation of pheromones cannot be accomplished
on small acreages because the treated area must be of sufficient size to account for the natural flight range of the
target pests, such that already mated females flying into the test area do not skew the results of the study. This problem
does not occur for most traditional toxicant pesticides which usually target the immature stage as these earlier
life stages do not possess the capability of flight. 
An additional factor necessitating larger acreages is the volatile nature of most pheromone compounds. It is unfeasible
to adequately separate treatments with small plots. For these reasons pheromones are usually tested in plot sizes
ranging from 20 to 60 acres, depending upon the nature of the treated site and the pest in question. To provide scientifically
sound information, it is generally conceded that four to six replications are necessary to validate the findings.
Thus, the position that 250 acres should be sufficient to determine the value for pesticidal purposes of most pheromones.
Moreover, as discussed in the section entitled ``Exposure and Effect,'' below, EPA believes that pheromones in solid
matrix dispensers tested on no more than 250 acres and at maximum application rates of 150 grams AI/acre/year will
not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. 



III. Exposure and Effect 


Since 1986, EPA has reviewed many arthropod-active pheromone products and has extensively reviewed pheromone toxicology
data from the public literature. Based on this information, discussed more fully below, EPA believes that field tests
conducted with pheromones in solid matrix dispensers and under the conditions outlined in this policy, will not cause
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. This conclusion is based on a number of factors, including the generally
low toxicity and high volatility of pheromones, the low environmental and human exposure expected from pheromones
used in solid matrix dispensers, and the low application rates and limited acreage required by this policy. Although
the natural background level of pheromones in the atmosphere has never directly been determined, atmospheric levels
for some pheromones have been estimated for peak population levels based on the pheromone emission rates for individual
female arthropods. These estimated values range widely since they can be based on the amount of pheromone present
in extracted glands or the measured emission rate and depend on what is considered the adult population during a peak
pest infestation. To safeguard for the lack of data on natural background levels, EPA has determined to set an upper
limit on the total amount of active ingredient released per acre per year from solid matrix dispensers at 150 gm. The
upper limit rate is necessary to ensure that pheromones used in solid matrix dispensers do not result in increased
levels of pheromones beyond natural background levels. 
The current upper limit for the application of a biochemical active ingredient lacking significant toxic effects
that does not require the submission of residue data is 20 grams AI/acre (40 CFR 158.690(b)(2)(B)). To facilitate
testing of pheromones for pesticidal purposes, the Agency is setting a more realistic upper limit for the amount of
active ingredient released during a season before an EUP is required. The Agency has found that given the low expected
toxicity and high volatility of arthropod pheromones, an upper limit of 150 grams AI/acre/year is adequate for testing
a pheromone product's feasibility and efficacy while still protecting public health, nontarget organisms and the
environment from unreasonable risks from compound levels which may be above ambient natural productions. These
application rates encompass the majority of pheromone uses seen by the Agency to date. 


IV. Human Health 


The study results and submitted data available to date have indicated the following: acute oral toxicity - (LD

50

 > 5,000 mg/kg category IV (nontoxic)); acute dermal toxicity (LD

50

 > 2,000 mg/kg category IV, (nontoxic)), acute inhalation toxicity (LD

50

 generally > 5 mg/L- category III-IV, practically (nontoxic)); no evidence of mutagenicity (Ames Salmonella assay);
and minimal eye and skin irritation. 
EPA has reviewed the results of submitted mammalian toxicology studies for the pheromone products registered to
date and also pheromone toxicology data from the public literature. The majority of the compounds registered to date
(26 of 31) have been Lepidopteran (e.g. butterfly and moth) pheromones. These registered pheromones fall within
a well defined class of chemical structures: aliphatic compounds with straight chains from 9 to 18 carbons in length
and up to 3 double bonds, and ending in an acetate, alcohol, aldehyde functional group. Pheromones have been discovered
with other chemical structures including compounds with ketone, epoxide, lactone, terpenoid, pyrazine, pyran,
and aromatic structures. In 1983, when EPA promulgated the exemption for pheromones used in traps, the Agency did
not distinguish between the rather restricted class of chemicals produced by Lepidopteran species and pheromones
with different chemical structures produced by other arthropod species (e.g. beetles, flies, and mites) for use
in traps. Because the proposed interpretation that the use of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers at an annual rate
of up to 150 gm AI/acre represents the same human risk as the use of pheromones in traps, EPA does not believe there is
a reason to distinguish between chemical classes of pheromones for pheromones in solid matrix dispensers. 
While the toxicology data base for pheromones with structures outside the well defined aliphatic Lepidopteran pheromones,
such as aromatic compounds, is not as extensive, there is no indication of significant toxic effects to mammalian
species from those compounds registered to date. The literature indicates that some aromatic pheromone compounds
could be potentially toxic due to structural similarities to other aromatic compounds. The data available to date
on both Lepidopteran and other arthropod pheromones, including several aromatic pheromones, however, have indicated
no mammalian toxicity at the limit dose levels. 
The volatility of these compounds also predicts that little, if any, of the released compound will actually be associated
with the crop. Studies to measure the natural background levels of insect pheromones in the environment or in or on
fruit indicate little or no detectable residues. When pheromone residue analyses were done on fruit treated with
from 129 to 141 gm AI/acre, no residues could be found with a detection limit of 2 to 5 ppb (Refs. 1 and 2). The current regulations
provide that, in the absence of any significant toxic effects, residue analysis can be required when biochemical
pesticides are applied above 20 gm AI/acre (40 CFR 158.690(b)). The Agency recognizes that the 150 gm AI/acre/yr rate
is well above the 20 gm/acre limit triggering a food residue analysis. However, the negligible exposure for pheromones
in dispensers, the natural occurrence of these compounds, their rapid biodegradation, high volatility and low worker
exposure associated with solid matrix dispensers justify raising the limit for when an EUP is required for testing
these volatile biochemical pesticides. 
Moreover, the Agency believes that an upper limit of 150 gm AI/acre/year for pheromones labeled for use in dispensers
as described below does not present a significant risk of dietary exposure due to the unlikelihood of direct contact
with food and the low probability of deposition on food or feed following atmospheric dilution. EPA, on its own initiative,
issued a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538), which proposes to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) the residues of arthropod pheromones resulting from the use of these substances in
solid matrix dispensers with an annual application rate limitation of 150 grams AI/acre/year for pest control in
or on all raw agricultural commodities. However, until this exemption from the requirements of a tolerance becomes
a final rule (anticipated in February 1994), a temporary tolerance and EUP application will be required if the treated
crop enters channels of trade. A final rule establishing an exemption from the requirements of a tolerance for inert
ingredients of retrievably sized semiochemical dispensers composed of polymeric matrix materials was published
in the 

Federal Register

 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64493). 

V. Ecological Effects 


Wildlife toxicity data indicate: high toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and moderate toxicity to fish, but practically
no toxicity to birds tested. Data for one Lepidopteran pheromone indicate low toxicity to avian bobwhite quail (acute
oral LD

50

 of >2,000 mg/kg of body weight and dietary LC

50

 of >5,000 mg/kg). However, this pheromone had a freshwater aquatic invertebrate (Daphnia magna) LC

50

 of between the solubility limit of 0.2 mg/l and a calculated LC

50

 of 0.58 mg/l. Observations of oily surface films at higher test concentrations confirmed the low solubility of the
test material. The conclusion was that this pheromone was highly toxic to Daphnia and that the calculated LC

50

 supported this conclusion. Whether the mortality was due to the pheromone in solution or a film on the water was not
determined. Another Lepidopteran pheromone was found to be moderately toxic to both Daphnia magna (LC

50

 8.6 mg/l) and the freshwater rainbow trout (LC

50

 5.9 mg/l). These results are sufficient to demonstrate the potential toxicity of Lepidopteran pheromones to nontarget
aquatic organisms. 
Although pheromones may be in matrix dispensers, rates of dissociation from matrices into water are not known. Refined
petroleum oils which form films at the water surface are registered by the Agency as pesticides for control of mosquito
larvae and pupae. Pesticidal oils, which may comprise some of these products, kill by arresting invertebrate respiration
and affect interfacial tension at the water surface upon which various arthropods depend for functions including
feeding, movement, and reproduction. To minimize the potential toxic effects on aquatic organisms, the pheromone
formulations in solid polymeric matrix retrievably sized dispensers should be for terrestrial use only and the experimental
use should not include use in or around marshes, swamps, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, estuaries, flood plains,
or drainage ditches. They should not be allowed to wash or drain into water. 
Despite the toxicity to aquatic organisms from pheromones, EPA believes that risks to aquatic organisms for tests
conducted under the conditions outlined in this notice are low. Pheromones in solid matrix dispensers would not be
expected to be used in water. In addition, many of the solid matrix dispensers of the type covered by this policy are
typically affixed to trees or plants or other fixed objects, and thus, are not likely to end up in bodies of water. 
Broadcast application is not included in this notice because the Agency does not have sufficient information on the
levels of exposure from pheromones which are broadcast. 


VI. Solid Matrix Dispensers 


Solid matrix dispensers, as defined in this notice, include, but are not limited to: Rubber septa dispensers, trilaminate
sheets, tapes, tags, wafers, macrocapillary devices, such as long tubes or fibers, twist ties, or ropes which are
placed by hand in the field and are of such and construction that they are readily seen. This policy does not apply to
the following formulations: Liquid flowables, microcapsules, microcapillary straws, granular powder, flakes,
or confetti formulations which are sprayed or broadcast over an area; and cigarette filters or unprotected ropes
which generally contain the active ingredient on the outer surface of the unit. The dispensers must not be of a size,
odor, taste or have other characteristics making them attractive to wildlife that potentially could collect or eat
them. Devices like netting, webbing, loose filaments, and adhesives capable of trapping or ensnaring nontarget
organisms such as birds also would not be covered by this policy. If inadvertently eaten, these dispensers should
be nontoxic and readily pass through an animal digestive system without causing blockage or puncture. 


VII. Agency Determinations


EPA has determined, pursuant to 40 CFR 172.3, to expand the land use limitation for testing for pesticidal value without
the need for an EUP from 10 acres to 250 acres for arthropod pheromones in solid matrix dispensers using no more than
150 grams AI/acre/year. This determination is based both on a finding that tests conducted under the conditions outlined
will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and on EPA's belief that it is necessary to test pheromones
in solid matrix dispensers on large acreages (i.e., larger than 10 acres) to determine their value for pesticidal
purposes. EPA retains the authority under 40 CFR 172.3 to require EUP's, on a case-by-case basis, for tests conducted
on acreages smaller than 250 acres if EPA determines that the test is not being conducted only for the purpose of determining
the pheromone's value for pesticidal purposes or if EPA determines that the test may cause unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment in the absence of agency oversight in the form of an EUP. 
Today's notice only addresses EPA's policy with regard to EUP's for pheromones in solid matrix dispensers. This notice
does not in any way obviate the need to obtain a tolerance under the FFDCA before using a pheromone product for food or
feed use. EPA intends to address use of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers on food or feed crops with an exemption
from the requirement for a tolerance under FFDCA. Such a proposed exemption was published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538). Moreover, EPA has published a final rule exempting certain inert ingredients used
in solid matrix dispensers from the requirement of tolerance (December 8, 1993, 58 FR 64493). 
Today's notice in no way affects the need to obtain an EUP for tests conducted on more than 10 acres with formulations
of pheromones products other than those described in the notice (i.e., pheromone formulations which are physically
smaller than solid matrix dispensers, such as sprayables). EUP's will continue to be required for tests conducted
on more than 10 acres using non-solid matrix dispenser formulations. 
EPA currently is considering whether to take additional actions to grant further regulatory relief for other types
of pheromone products. If EPA determines that any such regulatory relief is warranted, EPA would announce such a decision
in a future 

Federal Register

 notice.

Proposal of CERCLA 

De Minimis 

Waste Contributor Administrative Order on Consent for the Ninth Avenue Dump Site.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

U.S. EPA proposes to address the potential liability of the Institute of Gas Technology (``IGT'') under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., as amended
by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA''), Pub. L. 99-499, in connection with
the Ninth Avenue Dump Site (``the Facility'') by execution of a CERCLA 

de minimis 

waste contributor Administrative Order on Consent (``AOC'') prepared pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9622(g). The key terms
and conditions of the AOC may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) IGT would agree to a settlement amount of $1,019,723.53,
U.S. EPA would credit IGT for $340,863.00 for the amount already contributed by IGT toward the cleanup of the Facility,
and, accordingly, IGT would pay $678,860.53 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund; (2) U.S. EPA would covenant not
to sue IGT for ``covered matters'' which are defined as any and all civil liability in connection with the Facility
for reimbursement of response costs or for injunctive relief pursuant to CERCLA Sections 106 and 107 and RCRA Section
7003; (3) IGT would agree to the following reservations of rights and reopeners (i.e., limitations on the covenant
not to sue) by U.S. EPA_(a) U.S. EPA could sue IGT for failure to make a payment required by the AOC and/or in connection
with any matter not expressly included in ``covered matters'', (b) the covenant not to sue becomes null and void if
(i) U.S. EPA discovers that IGT contributed more than 400,000 gallons or 1.2% of the estimated total volume of hazardous
substances at the Facility, (ii) U.S. EPA discovers that IGT's waste contributions contribute disproportionately
to the toxic or other hazardous effects of the hazardous substances at the Facility, or (iii) IGT fails to make a payment
required by the AOC. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Facility is located in Gary, Indiana, and was operated as a hazardous waste storage facility until the mid-1970s.
Consequently, in 1983, the Facility was placed on the National Priority List. On December 7, 1988, U.S. EPA issued
a Unilateral Administrative Order (``UAO'') pursuant to Section 106(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606(a), to the Facility
operator and other Potentially Responsible Parties (``PRPs'') for the performance of a Phase I Operable Unit, or
interim, remedy. The Phase I Operable Unit remedy included construction of a slurry wall around the contaminated
portion of the Facility, extraction of contaminated oil floating on surface groundwater, and storage of the oil at
the Facility until implementation of the final remedy. In May, 1992, Phase I Operable Unit Remedial Action construction
activities were completed. Phase I Operation and Maintenance activities are ongoing. In March, 1989, U.S. EPA proposed
a final remedial action plan. After considering the public comments which it received, U.S. EPA selected a final,
or Phase II Operable Unit, remedy for the Facility. On August 17, 1989, U.S. EPA issued a second UAO pursuant to Section
106(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606(a), to PRPs for performance of the Phase II Operable Unit remedy. The Phase II Operable
Unit remedy provides for excavation of contaminated waste and fill; removal of contaminated sediment and debris
from surface water bodies; treatment of excavated waste, fill and highly contaminated sediments; back-filling
of the excavated area, installation of a RCRA Subtitle C cap; and extraction, treatment and reinjection of contaminated
groundwater. Phase II Operable Unit remediation activities are ongoing. 



In 1991, a 

de minimis 

settlement was entered into between U.S. EPA and 86 PRPs associated with the Facility. IGT was not provided an opportunity
to participate in the 1991 

de minimis 

settlement because the waste-in volumetric ranking at that time allocated to IGT a waste-in estimate that did not
meet the 

de minimis 

cutoff for that settlement. However, during the public comment period for the 1991 

de minimis 

settlement, IGT submitted comments arguing that it qualified for 

de minimis 

eligibility. In response to IGT's comments, U.S. EPA stated that ``the Agency has not foreclosed the possibility
of an additional settlement, should one be warranted, to include such parties at IGT.'' Since that time, U.S. EPA has
received sufficient information to make an appropriate determination, pursuant to Section 122(g) of CERCLA, 42
U.S.C. 9622(g), and all relevant U.S. EPA policy and guidance documents, that IGT is eligible for a 

de minimis 

settlement under the terms embodied in the AOC and in light of all the presently known facts and circumstances involving
the Facility. 

A 30-day period, commencing on the date of publication of this notice, is open pursuant to Section 122(i) of CERCLA,
42 U.S.C. 9622(i), for comments on the proposed AOC. Comments should be sent to the addressees identified in this notice.

<DOCTITLE>TSCA Section 21 Petition; Notice of Receipt </DOCTITLE>






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the receipt of a petition submitted by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Imperial, California,
under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and requests comments on the petition. The petition asks
EPA to issue a test rule under section 4 of TSCA to require monitoring of the New River for chemical pollutants and subsequent
health and environmental effects testing of the identified chemicals, among other requested actions. The New River
flows north from Mexico, through Mexicali, into Imperial County, California. Under section 21, EPA must respond
to the petition by March 16, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 16, 1993, EPA received a petition under section 21 of TSCA from the Board of Supervisors of the County of
Imperial, California. Section 21 of TSCA allows citizens to petition EPA to issue, amend, or repeal rules under section
4, 5, or 6 of TSCA. EPA must respond to the petition within 90 days of receipt. If the Agency grants the petition, it must
promptly commence an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, it must publish in the 

Federal Register

 the reasons for the denial. If EPA denies, or fails to respond to the petition within 90 days, the petitioner may commence
action in a United States (U.S.) district court to compel the Agency to initiate the rulemaking requested in the petition.



The petition raises a number of issues for EPA including legal, policy, and environmental justice issues. For example,
the petitioner asks EPA to find that discharges of a chemical into a river in a foreign country, where that chemical
subsequently reaches the U.S. border, in the river constitutes import into the U.S. under TSCA. Also, the scope of
the action requested by the petitioner involves monitoring a river for the presence of chemicals. Conducting a testing
program directed toward environmental monitoring is a somewhat different role for the TSCA testing program, which
is usually focused on health or environmental effects testing. A related issue is who would be required to conduct
such testing under TSCA section 4. 
EPA has initiated its review and evaluation process for this petition. EPA is evaluating the petitioner's request,
and is also gathering and reviewing additional available materials, in order to determine what action is appropriate
in response to the petition. In addition to either granting or denying the petition, EPA may determine to take additional
actions under TSCA or otherwise to address the concerns raised by the petitioner. 
Persons commenting are encouraged to provide EPA with information regarding the nature of possible contamination
of the New River, including available monitoring data or other information which might assist EPA in characterizing
possible pesticide or industrial chemical pollution. Commenters are also encouraged to provide their views regarding
the petitioner's description of the problem, the remedies sought by the petitioner, and the legal arguments put forth
by the petitioner. Persons who possess information they believe could be useful to the Agency in responding to this
petition are encouraged to submit the information promptly. 
In addition to the request for action under section 21 of TSCA, the petitioner states that the poor and predominantly
Hispanic citizens of Imperial County who live and work along the New River, as a matter of environmental equity, are
entitled to the same rigorous enforcement of environmental laws regarding water quality as citizens in other areas
of the United States. The petitioner also requests that EPA use the additional forum provided by the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to separately raise the need for a solution to the New River with Mexican officials. 
EPA has established a public record for this section 21 petition (Docket Number 211035). This record includes a copy
of the petition and all supplementary information submitted to the Agency by the petitioner. The Agency will include
all comments and information received in response to this notice, as well as other relevant material. The record is
available for inspection from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, in the TSCA NCIC, Rm
E-G102, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

<DOCTITLE>The National Board Fiscal Year 1994 Plan for Carrying Out the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice sets out the plan by which the 
Emergency Food and Shelter Program National Board (National Board) will conduct a program during fiscal year (FY)
1994 to distribute $130,000,000 to private voluntary organizations and local governments for delivering emergency
food and shelter to needy individuals. The distribution formula for selecting organizations and localities, and
the award amount for each, follow the Plan text. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title III of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 11301 et seq., authorizes use of funds 
appropriated by the Congress to supplement and expand ongoing efforts to provide shelter, food, and supportive services
to homeless, needy individuals. As in past phases, grant awards from this program are provided to address emergency
needs. This program is 

not

 intended to address or correct structural poverty or long-standing problems. Rather, this appropriation is intended
for the purchase of food and shelter to supplement and expand current available resources and not to substitute or
reimburse ongoing programs and services. 



The National Board has once again adopted the following operating principles: 

 Speedy administration and funding. 
 Awards to areas of greatest need. 
 Local decision-making. 
 Public/private sector cooperation. 
 Minimum, but accountable reporting. 

The National Board expects Local Boards, Local Recipient Organizations (LROs), and State Set-Aside (SSA) Committees
to abide by the stated rules of this Plan and to focus on the following concerns and principles mandated by the National
Board: 

 Serve individuals in need without discrimination and 
avoid duplication of benefits by supplementing food and shelter services which individuals might currently be receiving,
as well as by aiding those who are receiving no assistance. 

 Refuse to authorize the spending of funds on costs that differ from those allowed by the National Board, unless
a written request is made in advance and approved by the National Board. 

 Restrict shelter repairs to the minimum work required to bring the facility into compliance with local building
codes and for emergency repairs only to keep the facility open during the program year ($5,000 limit). Avoid decorative
or non-essential repairs and purchases as this is outside the intent of this program. The benefit of rehabilitation
to provide service should be carefully weighed against the response to needs that exist at the time. Emphasis should
be placed on currently existing needs. 

The National Board is mandated, as are Local Boards, LROs, SSA Committees, and FEMA, to carry out the intent of the law.
We must all ensure that as decisions are made, we not only question if a specific expenditure falls within the guidelines
for eligible costs, but also if making the expenditure would fulfill the intent of the program and the law. 

EFSP funding should be used to target special emergency needs. And when we discuss emergency needs we are referring
to economic, not disaster-related, emergencies. The funding should supplement feeding and sheltering efforts
in ways that make a difference. What this means is: 

 EFSP is not intended to make up for budget shortfalls or to be considered just a line in an annual budget;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940126-2-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940126-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 It is not intended that the funds must go to the same agencies for the exact same purposes every year; and, 

 The funding is open to all organizations helping hungry and homeless people and is not intended that the funds
should go only to Local Board member agencies or local government agencies. 

Having stated what it is not, what does the National Board want this program to be? EFSP should: 

 Create inclusive local coalitions that meet regularly to determine the best use of funds and to monitor their
use in their respective communities; 

 Treat every program year as a fresh opportunity to reassess what particular community needs (e.g. on-site
feeding or utility assistance, mass shelter or homelessness prevention) should be addressed; 

 Encourage agencies to work together to emphasize their respective strengths, work out common problems, and
prevent duplication of effort; and, 

 Examine whether the program is helping to meet the 
needs of special populations such as minorities, Native Americans, veterans, families with children, the elderly,
and the handicapped. 

We must emphasize that this program has a commitment to emergency services. We continue to view it as an opportunity
for building a cohesive emergency structure which can, for example, 

 Coordinate across agencies the emergency assistance provided to families and individuals applying for rental,
mortgage, or utility assistance; 

 Enhance a food banking network that is economical in its cost and broad in its coverage; 

 Reinforce creative cooperation among feeding and sheltering sites to ensure help for street populations
most in need; and, 

 Establish or maintain a system that complements rather than supplants existing private and governmental
efforts to provide rent, mortgage, or utility assistance. 

The National Board is aware that much is asked of our voluntary Local Boards and LROs, and very little administrative
funding is provided. But the cooperative model that EFSP has helped to create can be a useful vehicle for many governmental
and community-based programs. As a group, local providers can accomplish much: 

 Initiating a dialogue with local offices of Federal entities such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
take full advantage of excess commodities and its other programs or with the U.S. Department of Labor's Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA); 

 Working with Federal programs that require the input of local providers such as the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development's (HUD's) Community Development Block Grant and Emergency Shelter Grant and the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services' Health Care for the Homeless; 

 Pooling agency efforts to gain Federal (for example, HUD's Transitional Housing Program) and private foundation
grants; 

 Leveraging EFSP funds within the community by encouraging matches of local EFSP allocations from State and
local governments and private resources; and, 

 Exchanging ideas on administrative and accounting methods that can improve delivery of services and focus
on the collaborative rather than the competitive aspects of agency relations. 

Eleven years ago this program began as a one-time effort to help address urgent needs. The survival of this public-private
partnership is not only a testament to needs, but also to the effectiveness of EFSP as an example of local decision-making
and community responsibility in attempting to meet those needs. 

EFSP is a reminder of this nation's willingness to confront difficult problems within society in new ways. But most
importantly, EFSP has fed and sheltered homeless and hungry people, it has maintained homes and the families in those
homes, and it has created useful public-private partnerships within communities.

Section 1.0 Background and Introduction 


The Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) was established on March 24, 1983, with the signing of the ``Jobs Stimulus
Bill,'' Public Law 98-8. That legislation created a National Board, chaired by FEMA, which consisted of representatives
of the American Red Cross; Catholic Charities, USA; the Salvation Army; Council of Jewish Federations, Inc.; United
Way of America; and the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. 
Since that first piece of legislation in 1983, through its authorization under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance
Act (Pub. L. 100-77_signed into law on July 24, 1987, subsequently reauthorized under Public Law 100-628,
and signed into law on November 7, 1988), the EFSP has distributed more than $1.1 billion to over 10,500 social service
agencies in more than 2,500 communities across the country. 
From its inception, the unique features of this program have been the partnerships it has established. At the national
level, the Federal government and Board member organizations have the legal responsibility to work together to set
allocations criteria and establish program guidelines. Such coalitions, as set forth in the law, are even more vital
on the local level. In each community Local Boards make the most significant decisions on their own make-up and operation,
the types of services most in need of supplemental help, what organizations should be funded and for what purpose and
amount. These portions of the law have remained unchanged and are the core of this unique public-private partnership.



Section 1.1 Purpose 


This publication is developed by the National Board to outline the roles, responsibilities, and implementation
procedures which shall be followed by the Local Boards, Local Recipient Organizations (LROs), State Set-Aside (SSA)
Committees, National Board, and FEMA in the distribution and use of these funds. National in scope, EFSP will provide
food and shelter assistance to individuals in need through local private voluntary organizations and local governments
in areas designated by the National Board as being in highest need.

The intent of EFSP is to meet emergency needs by supplementing and expanding the food and shelter assistance that individuals
might currently be receiving, as well as to help those who are receiving no assistance. Individuals who received assistance
under previous programs may again be recipients, providing they meet local eligibility requirements. 


Section 2.0 Concept of Operations. 


(a) 

Secretariat of National Board. 

United Way of America will act as the National Board's Secretariat and fiscal agent and perform the necessary administrative
duties that the Board must accomplish. 
(b) 

Funds distribution. 

Funds distributed by the National Board will be to areas of greatest need (refer to section 2.3(a) and Supplementary
Information, above, for jurisdiction distribution formula and funding requirements). 
(c) 

Distribution to LROs. 

National Board funds will be distributed to LROs and Fiscal Agents certified eligible by Local Boards. (Refer to section
2.2(e) for selection of LROs and section 2.2(f) for the Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Agency Relationship). 
(d) 

Administrative allowance limitation. 

There is an administrative allowance limitation of two percent (2%) for local jurisdictions, one-half of one percent
(0.5%) for SSA Committees (when in operation), and one percent (1%) for the National Board. Local administrative
funds are intended for use by LROs and not for reimbursement of program or administrative costs which any recipient's
parent organization 
(its State or regional offices) might incur as a result of this additional funding. 
(e) 

Notification of award eligibility. 

The National Board will notify qualifying jurisdictions of award eligibility within 60 days following allocation
by FEMA. Unused or recaptured funds will be reallocated by the National Board, except in the case of SSA counties whose
funds may be reallocated by the respective SSA Committees. 
(f) 

Funds end-date. 

All funds shall be paid out by LROs and spending shall cease by their jurisdiction's selected end date. Local Boards
have until one month following their end date to submit final reports and complete documentation of expenses (for
specified LROs only) to the National Board. 
Those LROs not required to submit documentation to the National Board must satisfy the Local Board that all funds have
been expended in accordance with National Board guidelines. Q04




Note:

 Local Boards and LROs are reminded that although documentation may not be required to be submitted with their final
report, they are subject to random audits which may require the submission of documentation at a later date. 


Section 2.1 Financial Terms and Conditions 


(a) 

Definitions. Local Recipient Organization 

refers to the local 
private or public organizations that will receive any award of funds from the National Board. 


Award 

refers to the award of funds made by the National Board to a local private or public organization on the recommendation
of a Local Board. 


End-of-program date 

refers to the date, as agreed upon by Local and National Board, by which all monies in a given jurisdiction must be spent
or returned. 
(b) 

Amendments. 

An award may be amended at any time by a written modification. Amendments that reflect the rights and obligations of
either party shall be executed by both the National Board and the LRO. Administrative amendments such as changes in
accounting data may be issued unilaterally by the National Board. 
(c) 

Local Board authority related to LROs. 

(1) The Local Board is responsible for monitoring expenditures of LROs providing food, emergency services, or both,
authorizing the adjustment of funds between food and shelter programs, and reallocating funds from one LRO to another.

(2) Local Boards may not alter or change National Board cost eligibility or approve expenditures outside the National
Board's criteria without National Board permission. (Refer to Section 5.0 on Variances and waivers.) 
(3) A Local Board can call back funds from an LRO and reallocate to another LRO in the case of gross negligence, inadequate
use of funds, failure to use funds for purposes 
intended, or for any other violation of the National Board guidelines, or in cases of critical need in the community.
The Local Board must advise, in writing, all LROs of any reduction or reallocation of their original award. 
(4) If the Local Board discovers ineligible expenditures by an LRO, the Local Board must send to the organization a
written request for reimbursement of the amount. The National Board must also be notified. If the LRO is unwilling
or unable to reimburse the National Board for the ineligible expenditures, the Local Board must refer the matter to
the National Board. The National Board may ask the Local Board to take further action to see that reimbursement of ineligible
expenditures is made to the National Board, or the National Board may refer the matter to FEMA. 
If the Local Board suspects that fraud has been committed by an LRO, the Local Board must contact the Office of the Inspector
General, FEMA, in writing or by telephone at 
1-800-323-8603 with details of suspected fraud or misuse of Federal funds. 
(5) If an LRO received an award under previous phases, it must not include those funds in any reporting for the present
awards. Reports should be confined to the amount granted by the National Board under the new appropriations legislation.

(d) 

Cash Depositories.

 (1) Any money advanced to the LRO under the terms of this award must be deposited in a bank with Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) or Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) insurance coverage, and the balance
exceeding the FDIC or FSLIC coverage must be collaterally secured. Interest income earned on these monies must be
put back into program costs. 
(2) LROs are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members).
This is consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises. A list
of minority-owned banks can be obtained from the Office of Minority Business Enterprises, Department of Commerce,
Washington, DC 20203. 
(e) 

Retention and custodial requirements for records.

 (1) Financial records, supporting documentation, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the award
shall be retained for a period of three years, with the following exceptions: 
(i) If any litigation, claim or audit is started before the expiration of the three-year period, the records shall
be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved. 
(ii) Records for nonexpendable property, if any, 
acquired in part with Federal funds shall be retained for three years after submission of a final report. Nonexpendable
property is defined as tangible property having a useful life 
of more than one year and an acquisition cost of more than $300 per unit. 
(2) The retention period starts from the date of the submission by the LRO of the final expenditure report. 
(3) The National Board may request transfer of certain records to its custody from the LRO when it determines that the
records possess long-term retention value. The LRO shall make such transfers as requested. 
(4) The Director of FEMA, the Comptroller General of the United States, and the National Board, or any of their duly
authorized representatives, shall have access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient
organization, and its subgrantees to make audits, examinations, excerpts and transcripts. 
(f) 

Financial management systems.

 (1) The LRO/fiscal agent or fiscal conduit shall maintain a financial management system that provides for the following:

(i) Accurate, current and complete disclosures of the financial results of this program. 
(ii) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally supported activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal 
awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, and incomes. 
(iii) Effective control over and accountability for all 
funds, property, and other assets. 
(iv) Procedures for determining eligibility of costs in accordance with the provisions of the EFSP manual. 
(v) Accounting records that are supported by source documentation. The LRO must maintain and retain a register of
cash receipts and disbursements and original supporting documentation such as purchase orders, invoices, canceled
checks, and whatever other documentation is necessary to support its cost under the program. 
(vi) A systematic method to ensure timely and appropriate resolution of audit findings and recommendations. 
(vii) In cases where more than one civil jurisdiction (e.g., a city and a balance of county, or several counties) recommends
awards to the same LRO, the organization can combine these funds in a single account. However, separate program records
for each civil jurisdiction award must be kept. 
(g) 

Audit requirements.

 The LRO will be eligible to receive funds if it arranges for an audit of funds to coincide with the next scheduled annual
audit of its financial affairs. An original and two 
copies of this audit will be provided to the National Board on request. It is not necessary to have a separate, independent
audit for this award so long as program funds are treated as a separate element in the agency's regular annual audit.
If the LRO does not have a certified annual audit, its audit must be provided by a Local Board-designated fiscal agent
for the recipient organization willing to account for the funds. No funds will be issued to an LRO funded in the previous
phase that has not completed an annual audit. 
All National Board-funded agencies (both governmental and not-for-profit) that receive $100,000 or more in Federal
funds 

must

 comply with the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A-133. This $100,000 could be exclusively EFSP funds or a combination
of EFSP funds and other Federal funds which an agency might be receiving. In addition to compliance with the Single
Audit Act, the National Board requires all EFSP-funded agencies to meet the requirements stated in this plan regarding
program compliance, reporting, documentation and submission of documentation. 
(h) 

Payment

. A first payment shall be made to the LRO by the Secretariat upon recommendation of the Local Board and approval by the
National Board. An interim report will be mailed with the second and third check requests to be completed by each agency
and mailed to the National Board. Second/third installments will be held until the jurisdiction's final Local Board
report and documentation for the previous year has been reviewed and found to be clear.

(i) 

Financial reporting requirements

. LROs shall submit a financial status report to the Local Board which will forward it to the National Board within one
month after the jurisdiction's program ending date. 
The National Board shall provide the LRO, through the Local Board, with the necessary report forms well in advance
of report deadlines. 
(j) 

Closeout procedures

. (1) The following definitions shall apply to closeout 
procedures: 
``Close-out'' is the process by which the National Board determines that all applicable administrative actions
and all required work pertaining to the award have been completed. 
``Disallowed costs'' are those charges that the National Board determined to be unallowable in accordance with the
legislation, National Board requirements, applicable Federal cost principles, or other conditions contained
in the award. The applicable cost principles for Private Voluntary Organizations are contained in OMB Circular A-122,
``Cost Principles Applicable for Non-Profit Agencies,'' and OMB Circular A-110, ``Uniform Administrative
Requirements for Grants and Other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit
Organizations.'' The applicable cost principles for Public Organizations are contained in OMB Circular A-87,
``Cost Principles for State Agencies and Units 
of Local Governments.'' If unsure of where to find these circulars, check with your local Congressional Representative.

(k) 

Lobbying

. Public Law 101-121, section 319, states that an LRO shall not use federally appropriated grant funds for lobbying
activities. This condition bars the use of Federal money for political activities, but does not in any way restrict
lobbying or political activities paid for with non-Federal funds. This condition prohibits the use of Federal grant
funds for the following activities: 
(1) Federal, State or local electioneering and support of such entities as campaign organizations and political
action committees; 
(2) Direct lobbying of the Congress and State legislatures to influence legislation; 
(3) Grassroots lobbying concerning either Federal or 
State legislation; 
(4) Lobbying of the executive branch in connection with decisions to sign or veto enrolled legislation; and, 
(5) Efforts to utilize State or local officials to lobby the Congressional or State Legislatures. 


Secton 2.2 Organization, Roles, and Responsibilities 


(a) 

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

. 
FEMA will perform the following EFSP activities: 
(1) Constitute a National Board consisting of individuals affiliated with United Way of America; the Salvation Army;
the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA; Catholic Charities, USA; the Council of Jewish Federations,
Inc.; the American Red Cross; and FEMA. 
(2) Chair the National Board, using parliamentary procedures and consensus by the National Board as the mode of operation.

(3) Provide policy guidance, management oversight, Federal coordination, and staff assistance to the National
Board. 
(4) Award the grant to the National Board. 
(5) Assist the Secretariat in implementing the National Board Program. 
(6) Report to Congress on the year's program activities through the Interagency Council on the Homeless Annual Report.

(7) Conduct audits of the program. 
(8) Initiate Federal collection procedures to collect funds due when the efforts of the National Board have not been
successful. 
(b) 

National Board

. The National Board will: 
(1) Select jurisdictions of highest need for food and shelter assistance and determine amount to be distributed to
each. 
(2) Notify national organizations interested in emergency food and shelter to publicize the availability of funds.

(3) Develop the operational manual for distributing funds and establish criteria for expenditure of funds. 
(4) In jurisdictions that received previous awards, notify the former Local Board chair that new funds are available.
In areas newly selected for funding, notify the local United Way, American Red Cross, Salvation Army, or local government
official. The National Board will notify qualifying jurisdictions of award eligibility within 60 days following
allocation by FEMA. 
(5) Provide copies of award notification materials to National Board member affiliates and other interested parties.

(6) Secure certification forms and board rosters from Local Boards that funds will be used in accordance with established
criteria. 
(7) Distribute funds to selected LROs. 
(8) Hear appeals and grant waivers.

(9) Establish an equitable system to accomplish 
the reallocation of unclaimed or unused funds. 
(10) Ensure that funds are properly accounted for, and that funds due are collected. 
(11) Provide consultation and technical assistance to local jurisdictions as necessary to monitor program compliance.

(12) Submit end-of-program report on jurisdictions' use of funds to FEMA. 
(13) Conduct a compliance review of food and shelter expenditures made under this program for specified LROs. The
National Board, FEMA, the independent accounting firm selected by the National Board, or the Inspector General's
office may also conduct an audit of these funds. 
(14) Monitor LRO compliance with OMB Circular A-133. 
(c) 

State Set-Aside (SSA).

 (1) The SSA process has been adopted to allow greater flexibility in selection of jurisdictions and is intended to
target pockets of homelessness or poverty in non-qualifying jurisdictions (refer to Supplementary Information,
above, on qualifying criteria), areas experiencing drastic economic changes such as plant closings, areas with
high levels of unemployment or poverty which do not meet the minimum 500 unemployed, or jurisdictions that have documented
measures of need which are not adequately reflected in unemployment and poverty data. 
(2) The distribution of funds to SSA Committees will be based on a ratio calculated as follows: the State's average
number of unemployed in non-funded jurisdictions divided by the average number of unemployed in non-funded jurisdictions
nationwide equals the State's percentage of the total amount available for SSA awards. 
(3) An SSA Committee in each State will recommend high-need jurisdictions and award amounts to the National Board.
Priority consideration is to be given to jurisdictions otherwise not meeting criteria for funding, although funded
jurisdictions are not exempt from receiving additional funding. SSA Committees should also consider the special
circumstances of jurisdictions that qualified in previous funding phases but are not eligible in the current phase.
The State Committees may wish to provide these jurisdictions with an allocation so that the abrupt change in funding
status is not disruptive to local providers. SSA Committees are encouraged to consider current and significant State
or local data in their deliberations. Although the National Board staff provides national data to the SSA Committees,
it does 

not

 mandate any particular formula. These committees are free to act independently in choosing eligible jurisdictions.

(4) In each State, the State United Way (or United Way in the capital city) will be notified of the award amount available
to the SSA Committee. In a State where there are affiliates of the voluntary organizations represented on the National
Board, they must be invited to serve on the State Committee. If no single State affiliate exists, an appropriate representative
should be invited. The Governor or his/her representative will replace the FEMA member. State Committees are encouraged
to expand participation by inviting or notifying other private non-profit organizations on the State level. The
National Board encourages the inclusion of Native American representation on the State Committee. 
(5) Members of the SSA Committee shall elect a person to chair the committee.

(6) The SSA Committees are responsible for the 
following: 
(i) SSA Committees are charged with recommending 
high-need jurisdictions and award amounts within the State. When selecting jurisdictions with demonstrated need,
the National Board encourages the consideration of counties incorporating or adjoining Indian reservations. The
SSA Committee has 25 working days to notify the National Board in writing of its selections and the appropriate contact
person for each area.






Note:

 The minimum award amount for a single jurisdiction is $1,000 and only whole-dollar amounts can be allocated.

 

(ii) Notification to the National Board of selection criteria that were used to determine which jurisdictions within
the State was selected to receive funds. 
(iii) The National Board will then notify these jurisdictions directly. 
(iv) In the event that funds are not claimed by SSA jurisdictions, SSA Committees may recommend that other jurisdictions
receive the reallocated funds. 
(d) 

Local Board.

 (1) Each area designated by the National Board to receive funds shall constitute a Local Board. In a local community
where there are affiliates of the United Way of America, The Salvation Army, the National Council of Churches of Christ
in the U.S.A., Catholic Charities, U.S.A, Council of Jewish Federations, and the American Red Cross, which are represented
on the National Board, they must be invited to serve on the Local Board. The National Board mandates that if a jurisdiction
is located within or encompasses a federally recognized Indian reservation, a Native American representative must
be invited to serve on the Local Board. All Local Boards are required to include in their membership a homeless or formerly
homeless person. Local Boards should seek recommendations from LROs for an appropriate representative. The County
Executive/Mayor, appropriate head of local government or his or her designee will replace the FEMA member. An agency's
own governing board is not an acceptable substitute for a Local Board. Local Boards are encouraged to expand participation
and membership by inviting or notifying minority populations, other private non-profit organizations and 
government organizations; the jurisdiction should be geographically represented as well. 
The members of each Local Board will elect a chair. Local Board membership is not honorary; there are specific duties
the board must perform. If a member cannot regularly attend meetings, the member should be replaced by the member's
designated agency. If a member must be absent from a meeting, the member's organization may designate an alternate.

(2) If a locality has not previously received funding and is now designated as being in high need, the National Board
has designated the local United Way to constitute and convene a Local Board as described above. If there is no local
United Way, or it does not convene the board, the local American Red Cross, the local Salvation Army, or a local government
official will be responsible for convening the initial meeting of the Local Board. 
If a locality has previously received National Board 
funding, the former chairman of the Local Board will be contacted regarding any new funding the locality is designated
to receive. 
Each award phase is new; therefore, the Local Board is a new entity in every phase. The convener of the Local Board must
ask each agency to designate or redesignate a representative every program year. 
(3) The Local Board must establish and follow regular procedures. The National Board encourages Local Boards to hold
at least two meetings: a meeting to allocate the grant and a second to monitor LRO activities. A majority of members
must be present for the meeting to be official. (Attendance and decision-making minutes be kept). Meeting minutes
must be approved by the Local Board at the next meeting. They must 
also be available to the National Board, Federal authorities, and the public on request. 
(4) The Local Board will have 25 working days after the notification of the award selection by the National Board in
which to advertise and promote the program and consider all private voluntary and public organizations for participation,
including those on Indian reservations. Consideration must be given to any agency providing or capable of providing
emergency food and shelter services, not only those represented on the Local Board or affiliates of State or national
organizations. Advertising must take place prior to the Local Board's allocation of funds. Failure to advertise
properly will delay processing of the jurisdiction's board plan. 
(5) The Local Board selects and recommends which local organizations should receive grants and the amounts of the
grants. Since member agencies of the Local Board may also apply for funding, care must be taken that every applicant
is judged by common, consistent criteria. Local Board members should strive to use sound judgement and fairness in
their approach. The Local Board should be prepared to justify an allocation of one-third (1/3) or more of its total
award to a single LRO. 






Note:

 The minimum grant per LRO is $300 and only whole-dollar amounts may be allocated. 



(6) Local Boards are responsible for monitoring LROs that receive over $100,000 in Federal funds and ensure that they
comply with the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A-133.

(7) Local Boards must complete and return all required forms to the National Board. (Local Board Plan, Local Board
Certification Form, and Local Board Roster). 

(8) Local Boards shall secure and retain signed forms from each LRO certifying that program guidelines have been read
and understood, and that the LROs will comply with cost eligibility and reporting requirements. 

(9) Local Boards must establish a system to ensure that no duplication of service occurs within the expenditure categories
of rent, mortgage or utility assistance (RMU). 

(10) Local Boards must notify the National Board of changes in the Local Board chair, staff contact, or LRO contacts,
including complete addresses and phone numbers. 

(11) Local Boards that determine they can better utilize their resources by merging with neighboring boards may do
so. The head of government or his or her designee for each jurisdiction must sit on the merged board, along with agency
representatives from each jurisdiction. The merged Local Board must ensure that the award amount designated for
each civil jurisdiction is used to provide assistance to individuals within that jurisdiction. 

(12) Local Boards are required to be familiar with current guidelines and to provide technical assistance to service
providers. Advice and counsel can be provided by National Board staff. 

(13) An appeals process must be established to address participation or funding including, where deemed appropriate,
the involvement of individuals not a part of the dispute in the decision, to hear and resolve appeals made by funded
or non-funded organizations, and to investigate complaints made by individuals or organizations. Appeals should
be handled promptly. Cases that cannot be handled locally should be referred in writing to the National Board and include
details on action that has been taken. Cases involving fraud or other misuse of Federal funds should be reported to
the Office of the Inspector General, FEMA, in writing or by telephone at 
1-800-323-8603. 

(14) The chair of the Local Board or his or her designated staff will be the central coordination point of contact between
the National Board and the LRO selected to receive assistance from EFSP. To facilitate program coordination, the
chair of the Local Board will contact the State agencies through which surplus food and other Federal assistance are
provided. 

(15) Local Boards will be responsible for monitoring programs carried out by the LROs they have selected to receive
funds. Local Boards should work with LROs to ensure that funds are being used to meet immediate food and shelter needs
on an ongoing basis. Local Boards may not alter or change National Board cost eligibility or approve expenditures

outside the National Board's criteria without National Board permission. 

(16) The Local Board should reallocate funds whenever it determines that the original allocation plan does not reflect
the actual need for services or if an LRO is unable to use its full award effectively. Funds must be recovered and may
be reallocated if an LRO makes ineligible expenditures or uses funds for items that have clearly not been approved
by the Local Board. Funds held in escrow for LROs which have unresolved compliance problems can be reallocated or may
be reclaimed by the National Board. 

The Local Board may approve reallocation of funds between LROs that are already participating in the program. However,
the National Board must be notified in writing. The Local Board may also return funds to the National Board for reissuance
to another LRO or request reallocation of remaining funds before they are released by the National Board (e.g., second/third
payments). 

If the Local Board wishes to reallocate funds to an agency that was not approved on the original board plan, a written
request for approval must be made to the National Board. An LRO must be approved by the National Board prior to receipt
of funds. 

If a Local Board is unable to satisfy the National Board 
that it can utilize funds in accordance with this plan, the 
National Board may reallocate the funds to other jurisdictions.

(17) Should anyone have reason to suspect that EFSP funds are being used for purposes contrary to the law and guidelines
governing the program, the National Board recommends taking action to assist in bringing such practices to a halt.


The National Board requires that the Office of the Inspector General, FEMA, be contacted immediately when fraud,
theft, or other criminal activity is suspected in connection with the use of EFSP funds, or the operation of a facility
receiving EFSP funds. This notification can be made by calling the FEMA Inspector General's Hotline at 1-800-323-8603,
or by writing to: Office of the Inspector General, FEMA, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472. The complainant should
include as much information as possible to support the allegation and preferably furnish his/her name and telephone
number so that the special agents assigned to the Inspector General's office may make a follow-up contact. The confidentiality
of any communication made with the Office of Inspector General is protected by Federal law. 

A complainant desiring to remain totally anonymous should make a follow-up phone call to the Office of the Inspector
General within 30 days from the date of the original complaint so that any follow-up questions may be asked. Follow-up
calls should be made to 1-202-646-3894 during normal business hours, Eastern Standard Time (charges
may be reversed). The caller should advise that he/she is making a follow-up call regarding a prior anonymous complaint.
The Office of the Inspector General, FEMA, will appropriately notify both local law enforcement authorities and
the National Board concerning the substance of the allegations and the results of the investigation. 

(18) Reports to the National Board on LROs' expenditures shall be submitted as the date each LRO's second/third check
is requested and a final report should be submitted one month after the jurisdiction's end-of-program date. 

(19) After the close of the program, the accuracy of all LROs' reports and documentation shall be reviewed. Documentation
for specified LROs should be forwarded to the National Board as requested. In the event of expenditures violating
the eligible costs under this award, the Local Board must require reimbursement to the National Board. 

Local Boards are required to remain in operation until all program and compliance requirements of the National Board
have been satisfied. All records related to the program must be retained for three (3) years from the end-of-program
date. 

(20) Each jurisdiction will be granted the option to extend its spending period by 30, 60, or 90 days. This option will
be offered during the summer of each phase. The extension applies to the entire jurisdiction. Should the 
jurisdiction receive a grant in the next phase, that phase's spending period will begin the day after the chosen end-date.


(e) 

Local Recipient Organization

. 
(1) In selecting LROs to receive funds, the Local Board must consider the demonstrated ability of an organization
to provide food and shelter assistance. LROs should be selected to receive funds to supplement and extend eligible
ongoing services, not be funded in anticipation of a needed service (e.g., victims of fire, flood, or tornado); neither
should agencies be selected for funding due to budget shortfalls nor for cuts in other funding sources. Local participation
in the program is not limited to organizations that are part of any State or national organization. Agencies on Indian
reservations are eligible to receive EFSP funds if they meet LRO requirements as set forth in the program manual. Organizations
that received awards from previous legislation may again be eligible provided that the organization still meets
eligibility requirements. 

(2) For a local organization to be eligible for funding it must: 

(i) Be nonprofit or an agency of government; 

(ii) Have an accounting system or an approved fiscal agent; 

(iii) Have a Federal employer identification number (FEIN), or be in the process of securing FEIN (Note: contact 
local Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office for more information on securing FEIN and the necessary form [SS-4];


(iv) Conduct an independent annual audit (Note: if LRO was funded in previous phase, information regarding annual
audit must be included on final report; no funds will be issued until annual audit has been conducted); 

(v) Practice nondiscrimination. Those agencies with a 
religious affiliation wishing to participate in the program must agree not to refuse services to an applicant based
on religion or require attendance at religious services as a condition of assistance, nor will such groups engage
in any religious proselytizing in any program receiving EFSP funds; and,

<PARENT> FR940126-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(vi) For private voluntary organizations, have a 
voluntary board. 

Each LRO will be responsible for certifying in writing to the Local Board that it has read and agrees to abide by the cost
eligibility and reporting standards of this publication and any other requirements made by the Local Board. 

An LRO may 

not

 operate as a vendor for itself or other LROs except for the shared maintenance fee for food banks. 

(3) LROs selected for funding must: 

(i) Maintain records according to the guidelines set 
forth in the manual. Consult the Local Board chair/staff on matters requiring interpretation or clarification prior
to incurring an expense or entering into a contract. It is important to have a thorough understanding of these guidelines
to avoid ineligible expenditures and consequent repayment of funds. LROs' questions can be answered by National
Board staff at (703) 706-9660. 

(ii) Provide services within the intent of the program. Funds are to be used to supplement and extend or initiate food
and shelter services, not as a substitute for other program funds. LROs should take the most cost-effective approach
in buying or leasing eligible items/services, and should limit purchases to essential items within the $300.00 limit
for 
equipment, unless prior approval has been granted by the National Board. 

(iii) Deposit funds for this program in a federally insured bank account. Proper documentation must be maintained
for all expenditures under this program according to the guidelines. Agencies should ensure that selected banks
will return canceled checks. LROs' expenditures and documentation will be subject to review for program compliance
by the Local Board, National Board or Federal authorities. Records must be maintained for three years and any interest
income must be put back into program expenditures. 

(iv) LRO Documentation of EFSP expenditures requires copies of canceled checks (both sides) and itemized vendor
invoices. An acceptable invoice has the following characteristics: 

(A) It must be vendor originated; 

(B) It must have name of vendor; 

(C) It must have name of purchaser; 

(D) It must have date of purchase; 

(E) It must be itemized; and, 

(F) It must have total cost of purchase. 

All LROs will be required to periodically submit documentation to the National Board to ensure continued program
compliance. Any LRO receiving over $100,000 in Federal funds must comply with the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A-133.


(v) In addition to the aforementioned documentation, reports to the Local Board must be submitted by their due date.
Interim report/second and third check request forms will be enclosed in the LROs' first check package. When the LRO
is ready to request its second/third check it must complete and sign the interim report and forward it to the Local Board
for its review and approval. The reverse side (second/third check request) should be completed by the Local Board
chair and mailed to the National Board. LROs must complete all portions of the final report form, return two copies
to the Local Board, including one copy of documentation if requested, and retain a copy for their records. 

(vi) The LRO must work with the Local Board to quickly 
clear up any problems related to compliance exception(s) at the end of the program. 

(vii) The LRO shall contact the Local Board regarding technical assistance, interpretation of guidelines, and resources
from other Federal programs, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) surplus food. 

(f) 

Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Relationship

. 
(1) For National Board purposes, a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit is an agency that is serving as the mechanism for other
agencies to benefit from EFSP funds. 

(2) The fiscal agent/fiscal conduit is the organization responsible for the receipt of funds, disbursement of funds
to vendors, and documentation of funds received. The fiscal 
agent/fiscal conduit must meet all of the requirements of an LRO. 

(3) Local Boards may wish to use a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit when they desire to fund an agency not having an adequate
accounting system or not conducting an annual audit. 

(4) Any agency benefitting from funds received by a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit must meet all of the criteria to be
an LRO except the accounting system and annual audit requirements and sign the Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Relationship
Certification Form. 

(5) Fiscal agents/fiscal conduits may cut checks to vendors only. They may not cut checks to the agencies on whose behalf
they are acting or to agencies/sites under their ``umbrella.'' The exception to this is when an agency is using the
per diem allowance. 

(6) Fiscal agents will be required to submit individual interim and final reports for each agency. Fiscal conduits
will file a single interim report on their awards along with a breakdown of agencies and spending with the final report.


(7) Fiscal agents may not fund an LRO with an outstanding compliance exception. If a fiscal agent has an unresolved
compliance exception, any other funds awarded to the fiscal agent will be held in escrow until all compliance exceptions
are resolved.

Section 2.3 General Guidelines


(a) 

Designation of target areas. 

Local jurisdictions will be selected to receive funds from the National Board based on average unemployment statistics
from the U.S. Department of Labor for the most current 12-month period (July 1992-August 1993) available. Also
used are poverty statistics from the 1990 Census. The Board adopted this combined approach in order to target funds
for high-need areas more effectively. Funds designated for a particular jurisdiction must be used to provide services
within that jurisdiction.
The National Board based its determination of high-need jurisdictions on four factors:
1. Most current twelve-month national unemployment rates;
2. Total number of unemployed within a civil jurisdiction;
3. Total number of individuals below the poverty level within a civil jurisdiction; and,
4. The total population of the civil jurisdiction.
In addition to unemployment, poverty was used to qualify a jurisdiction for receipt of an award.
Jurisdictions were selected under Phase XII (PL 103-124) according to the following criteria:
 Jurisdictions, including balance of counties, with 18,000+ unemployed and a 6.1% rate of unemployment.
 Jurisdictions, including balance of counties, with 500 to 17,999 unemployed and an 8.5% rate of unemployment.
 Jurisdictions, including balance of counties, with 500 or more unemployed and an 11.7% rate of poverty. Jurisdictions
with a minimum of 500 unemployed may qualify for an award based upon their rate of unemployment or their rate of poverty.
Once a jurisdiction's eligibility is established, the National Board will determine its fund distribution based
on a ratio calculated as follows: The average number of unemployed within an eligible area divided by the average number
of unemployed covered by the national program equals the area's portion of the award (less National Board administrative
costs, and less that portion of program funds required to fulfill designated awards).



Area's avg. No. unemployed_Avg. No. unemployed in all eligible areas = Area's percent of the award (less National
Board's administrative costs and designated awards)



Puerto Rico and U.S. territories will receive a designated percentage of the total award based on the decision of the
National Board.


(b) 

Grant award process. 

(1) United Way of America has been designated as the fiscal agent for the National Board and as such will process all
Local Board plans. Payments will be made to organizations recommended by Local Boards for funding. Local Boards have
the right to reallocate funds throughout the program period, as they determine necessary. When a Local Board reallocation
between two or more LROs occurs, the Local Board must promptly notify the National Board in writing so that the National
Board's records can be updated accordingly.
(2) The National Board offers two methods of payment to LROs. The two methods are either direct deposit (electronic
funds transfer) or checks. The National Board encourages LROs to take advantage of direct deposit where possible.
(3) To ensure greater accountability and reporting, awards totaling less than $100,000 are paid in two equal installments.
Awards totaling $100,000 or more will be paid in three equal installments.
(4) The National Board will distribute second/third payments once the jurisdiction's compliance review is completed
for the previous program period. Second/third payments will be held in escrow until all compliance exceptions are
satisfied by the LRO.
All payments will be mailed directly to the LRO. Second and third payments will be mailed to the LRO only upon the written
request of the Local Board Chair which encloses the LROs interim report. The Local Board will authorize second and/or
third payments once it is assured that the organization is implementing the current program as intended and according
to the guidelines in the Plan.
(c) 

Client eligibility. 

The National Board does not set client eligibility criteria. Local Boards may choose to set such criteria. If the Local
Board does not set eligibility criteria, the LRO may use its existing criteria or set criteria for assistance under
this award. However, the LROs criteria must provide for assistance to needy individuals without discrimination
(age, race, sex, religion, national origin, or handicap).





Note: 

Funds allocated to a jurisdiction are intended for use within that jurisdiction. Residents of or transients in a specific
jurisdiction should seek service within that jurisdiction.



Citizenship is not an eligibility requirement to receive assistance from EFSP. The National Board does not mandate
nor recommend the use of any particular existing criteria (i.e., food stamp guidelines, welfare guidelines, or income
guidelines).


Section 2.4 Eligibility of Costs


The intent of this appropriation is for the purchase of food and shelter to supplement and extend current available
resources and not to substitute or reimburse ongoing programs and services. Questions regarding interpretation
of the program's guidelines should be cleared by the LRO with the Local Board prior to action. Local Boards unsure of
the meaning of these guidelines should contact the National Board at (703) 706-9660 for clarification prior
to advising the LRO.
If an expenditure requested by an LRO is not listed below as eligible, the Local Board has the option of requesting a
waiver from the National Board for consideration.

Note: 

All social service providers are mandated to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Documentation
required: copy of contract describing work to be done including cost, letter from Local Board indicating approval
and amount approved, and canceled checks.

 

For mass shelter providers, there are two options for eligible costs. One option must be selected at the beginning
of the program year and continued throughout the entire year. Note the documentation requirements for each option.

(14) Reimbursement of actual direct eligible costs; in which case canceled checks and vendor invoices for supplies/equipment

(ii) LROs total mass shelter award is expended in this manner.





Note:

 It is the decision of the Local Board to choose between the $5/$10 rate. This rate may vary from agency to agency. The
$5/$10 per diem, if elected, may be expended by the LRO for any related cost; it is not limited to otherwise eligible
items. The per diem allowance does not include the additional costs associated with food. Documentation required:
schedule showing daily rate of $5 or $10 and number of persons sheltered by date with totals.



For rent/mortgage assistance, eligible program costs include: 
(16) Limited emergency rent or mortgage assistance for individuals or families, provided that:

(17) First month's rent may be paid when an individual or family: 
(i) Is transient and plans to stay in the area for an extended period of time; or, 
(ii) Is moving from a temporary shelter to a more permanent living arrangement; or,

that a recipient's parent organization (its State or regional offices) might incur as a result of this additional
funding. 

(2) The Local Board may elect to use, for its own administrative costs, all or any portion of the 2 percent allowance.
The decision on distribution of the allowance among LROs rests with the Local Board. No LRO may receive an allowance
greater than 2 percent of that LROs award amount unless the LRO is providing the administrative support for the Local
Board and it is approved by the National Board.

(3) The SSA Committee, when in operation, may utilize a maximum of one-half of one percent (0.5%) for its administrative
costs in allocating the SSA grant. As with Local Board 
awards, this administrative allowance is part of the total award, not in addition to the award. 
(4) Any of the administrative allowance not used must be put back into program funds for additional services.

 



Note: 

The administrative allowance may only be allocated in whole-dollar amounts. 


Section 3.0 Independent Annual Audit Requirements


To be eligible to receive or administer EFSP funds, every LRO must have an independent annual audit. Depending on several
factors (the size of the agency's budget, the number of Federal grants the agency receives, the size of the agency's
grant, the complexity of the agency's accounting system, etc.), the agency's audit may or may not require the expertise
of a certified public accountant. In some 
instances, an agency's accounting system is so simple and the restricted funds are only from EFSP, that a knowledgeable
bookkeeper could perform the audit. In other cases, the agency has many Federal grants and is required to have an A-133
audit which must be performed by a CPA. Agencies must carefully choose what type of audit is required and select an appropriate
independent auditor. 
An independent audit is performed by someone unaffiliated with the organization. For instance, an agency's own accountant
cannot audit his employer's books. The audit must include an examination of the agency's fiscal controls as well as
an inspection of records (including journals, ledgers, checkbooks and bank statements, receipts, contracts, etc.).
Finally, the auditor must render an opinion on the agency's financial records (do the records presented accurately
reflect the agency's finances?). The independent annual audit must include the following: 
(1) A balance sheet as of the last day of the fiscal year; 
(2) A statement of revenue and expense for the fiscal year; 
(3) A statement of internal controls; 
(4) The auditor's opinion. 




The agency's entire program funds must be included in the audit. The audit must meet the generally accepted auditing
standards as set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For a copy of the generally accepted auditing
standards, contact the National Board staff. 


Section 4.0 Appeals Process for Participation/Funding 


(a) 

Fairness and openness. 

An appeals process is a statement to eligible agencies and to the community at large that the Local Board is interested
in fairness and openness. 
A good appeals process begins with prevention. If the Local Board includes both representatives of affiliates of
the National Board and representatives of other groups involved with assisting hungry and homeless people, it is
less likely to experience an appeal. Similarly, if the Local Board's 
decision-making process is open, thorough, and even-handed, appeals are less likely. 
It is the responsibility of the Local Board to establish a written appeals process. That process may be simple or elaborate,
depending on the needs of the community. 
(b) 

Appeals guidelines. 

The appeal process should meet the following guidelines: 
(1) It should be available to agencies and to the public upon request; 
(2) It should be timely, without undue delay; 
(3) It should include the basis for appeal (e.g., provision of information not previously available to the group making
the appeal or to the Local Board; correction of erroneous information; violation of Federal or National Board 
guidelines; or allegation of bias, fraud, or misuse of Federal funds on the part of the Local Board may be cause for appeal);

(4) The decision should be communicated to the organization making the appeal in a timely manner. In the case of an appeal
on the basis of fraud or other abuse of Federal funds, the agency making the appeal must be informed of the right of referral
to the National Board. 
(c) 

Primary decision maker. 

Except for cost and LRO eligibility, the Local Board is the primary decision maker. Only when there is a significant
question of misapplication of guidelines, fraud, or other abuse on the part of the Local Board will the National Board
consider action.

<PARENT> FR940126-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) 

Common appeals practices. 

The National Board does not mandate any particular appeals process. However, some Local Boards have developed processes
which work well for them and may offer some help to other communities. Common practices include the following: 

(1) Set a time period of not more than 30 days for agencies or organizations to appeal a funding decision; 

(2) Require written notice of appeal, signed by the Chief Volunteer Officer of the organization making the appeal;


(3) The first level of appeal is usually to the 
Local Board, or to an executive committee of the board. 

(e) 

Appeals boards, delegations

. Some boards appoint one or more members to act as a liaison with the organization making the appeal: 

(1) In the case of an appeal for the purpose of providing previously unavailable information or correction of erroneous
information, the process usually ends with prompt notification of decision (within 10 working days of appeal). 

(2) In the case of appeals for the purpose of contesting alleged prejudice, violation of law or National Board guidelines,
fraud, or misuse of Federal funds, some boards have allowed appeals to a group other than the board itself. This practice
is not mandated but is permitted by the National Board. Such groups vary. They may simply be composed of different individuals
representing the same organizations that make up the Local Board. They may also include an entirely different group
of persons who have knowledge of the program and are deemed by the board to be both responsible and unbiased, and to hold
the trust of the community at large. 

(3) If the board chooses to delegate authority to any third party in an appeals process, the power and authority of that
body should be clear. Is it simply advisory to the Local Board? Will the board abide by the decisions of this body as long
as they are consistent with the law and the National Board guidelines? 

(4) The disposition of appeals is often communicated by telephone to the chief professional and volunteer officers
of the organization appealing immediately after a decision is made. In such cases, a written communication is sent
as soon as possible confirming the action taken. The written communication is, of course, the official notification.


(f) 

National Board role. 

It is important to reaffirm that no single appeals process is mandated or advised by the National Board. 



Section 5.0 Variances and Waivers 



(a) 

Variances

. Local Boards may receive requests for variances in the budgets they have approved for LROs. Local Boards may allow
such changes provided that the requested items are eligible under this program. If there is any doubt on the part of
the Local Board as to eligibility, it should contact the National Board for clarification. 

If an expenditure requested by an LRO falls outside the program guidelines, the Local Board, if in accord, should request
in writing a waiver from the National Board in advance of the expenditure. 

(b) 

Waivers

. Waivers requested because of a compliance exception must be submitted to the Local and then National Board for review.
National Board staff will evaluate waiver requests and use discretion to approve or deny requests. In general, the
National Board considers waiver requests that are not within the guidelines but address the program's intent. 

The waiver request from the Local Board should clearly state the need for the exception, approximate costs, timeliness
or any other pertinent information it deems necessary for the National Board to make its decision. 



Section 6.0 Reporting Requirements 



Local Boards must monitor LROs' expenditures and eligible cost compliance throughout the program period. An interim
report of expenditures is due to the National Board with each LRO's second/third check request. A final report (accompanied
by financial documentation for specified LROs) is due one month after the end of each jurisdiction's program. The
National Board will provide forms for all required reports. The National Board advises Local Boards to request at
least one other report from their LROs at a time deemed appropriate by each Local Board.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940126-2-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940126-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

LROs that successfully completed previous program compliance reviews and are receiving funds under this program
may not be required to submit documentation with their final reports unless specifically asked to do so by the National
Board; however, successful completion does not mean automatic exemption from submission. Documentation will be
required for LROs not funded in the previous phase of the program. 

Failure of an LRO to comply with the National Board's reporting requirements may result in its funds being held in escrow.
Funds will be held until all reporting requirements 
have been satisfied. If an LRO does not comply in a timely 
manner, the Local Board or National Board may reclaim and reallocate the funds being held in escrow. 

The National Board will compile the reports it receives 
from the Local Boards and submit a detailed accounting of use of all program monies in the form of a report to FEMA. 

If the Local Board discovers lack of documentation, ineligible expenditures or any other problem in an LRO report,
it should contact the LRO and attempt to correct the problem before submitting the report to the National Board. If
the National Board discovers a problem, it will inform the Local Board and LRO and advise them of the action to be taken.
It is the responsibility of the Local Board to continue working with LROs which have compliance problems until they
have been cleared by the Secretariat. 

To avoid compliance-related problems, the Local Board should ensure that LROs have a thorough understanding of the
types of documentation (e.g., canceled checks [both sides], invoices, contracts, lease agreements, utility bills)
they must retain to meet cost eligibility guidelines. Items not listed as eligible or ineligible should not be assumed
to be eligible. Local Boards are advised to contact National Board staff for clarification on items subject to interpretation.


LROs failing to clear the National Board compliance review after a reasonable amount of time will be referred to FEMA
and will remain ineligible to receive funds until audit problems are resolved with FEMA.

The National Board reserves the right to amend this Plan at any time.

Petition of Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc.; Extension of Time for Replies




Notice was published on January 6, 1994, 59 FR 748, of the filing of a petition by Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc. pursuant
to 46 CFR 514.8(a), for permanent exemption of its Local Freight Tariff No. 3-C, FMC_F No. 4, ICC TOTE 201, from
the electronic tariff filing requirements of the Commission's ATFI System, on the grounds that the tariff is jointly

with the ATFI filing requirements. Alternatively, petitioner seeks complete exemption from filing the tariff in
paper or electronic form.

Upon the request of Sea-Land Service, Inc., the Commission has now determined to extend the time provided for interested
persons to reply to the petition. Replies are now due by February 17, 1994, and shall be directed to the Secretary, Federal
Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573-0001, shall consist of an original and 15 copies, and shall be served
on Counsel for petitioner, Mr. Michael D. Duppenthaler, Registered Practioner, Interstate Commerce Commission,
1100 Olive Way, suite 1150, Seattle, Washington 98101-1839.

Copies of the petition are available for examination at the Washington, DC office of the Secretary of the Commission,

Health Education Assistance Loan Program: Correction to List of Defaulted Borrowers 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Public Health Service, HHS.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Public Health Service (PHS) is publishing this notice of 159 Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) borrowers
who should not have been included in the August 30, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 45654) publication of HEAL borrowers in default. The August 30, 1993 publication was required by section 709(c)(1)
of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of
1992. This was the first annual publication and identified 4,973 HEAL borrowers in default.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 709(c)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 292h(c)(1)) requires the Agency to compile and publish in the 

Federal Register

 a list of HEAL borrowers who are in default. All borrowers who had defaulted on HEAL loans and for whom claims had been
paid by the Department of Health and Human Services (Department), from the beginning of the HEAL program through March
31, 1993, were subject to inclusion in the August 30, 1993 notice. However, to identify most accurately those HEAL
borrowers who were in an unsatisfactory status with the Department, borrowers in the following categories were excluded
from the August 30, 1993 listing: (1) Those who had paid their loan in full subsequent to their default; (2) those who
had received HEAL loan cancellation due to death or permanent and total disability; (3) those whose loans had been
repurchased from the Department by a HEAL school, lender, or holder; (4) those who had been approved by the Department
for deferment or forbearance; and (5) those who had made 12 monthly payments or the equivalent during the 12-month
period ending March 31, 1993. Borrowers in the above five categories were viewed by the Department as having made satisfactory
arrangements to resolve the default or as no longer obligated to repay a HEAL loan to the Department, and therefore
were excluded from publication in the August 30, 1993 listing. 



Since publication of the August 30, 1993 listing, the Department has determined that the names of some borrowers should
not have been published. Accordingly, this notice lists borrowers who should not have been included in the August
30, 1993 listing. 

The first category of borrowers whose names should not have been published are those for whom, as of March 31, 1993,
the Department had paid one or more claims due to the borrower filing for protection under bankruptcy law and who were
not in default status on a HEAL loan. A total of 115 names are included for this reason. 

It is important to note that this category of corrections includes only loans in bankruptcy that were not in a default
status as of March 31, 1993. Thus, any borrower with a loan in bankruptcy that was in default prior to or subsequent to
the bankruptcy proceedings, and who did not qualify for any of the 5 exclusionary categories listed above, was included
appropriately in the August 30, 1993 publication. In addition, it should be noted that HEAL loans are not eligible
for discharge in bankruptcy except under very limited circumstances, as set forth in 42 U.S.C. 292f(g). Thus, a HEAL
borrower generally remains responsible for repayment of the HEAL loan once the bankruptcy proceedings have been
completed, and could be included in a future listing of HEAL defaulters if he or she failed to enter a satisfactory repayment
arrangement subsequent to the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings. 

The second category of borrowers, whose names were published in error, are those for whom default claims were paid
by the Department, but who, subsequent to publication of the notice, were determined by the Department to have met
one of the following categories for exclusion from the listing, based on their status as of March 31, 1993: (1) Had paid
their loans in full; (2) had been approved by the Department for forbearance; or (3) had made the equivalent of 12 monthly
payments during the 12-month period ending March 31, 1993. A total of 44 names are included for these reasons. 

An updated listing of HEAL defaulters who are not in a satisfactory repayment status will be published in late 1994.
Those who have entered satisfactory repayment will not be included in that listing.

Opportunities for Youth: Notice of Funds Availability for the Development and Implementation of Youthbuild Programs





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; extension of the deadline; use of emergency funds. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Because of weather and delivery problems, this Notice announces an extension of the deadline for applications for
the Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) for Opportunities for Youth: Youthbuild Programs which was published on
September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49849. This notice also announces that because of the recent earthquake in the Los Angeles
area, the Department is using its authority under the Youthbuild Program to provide emergency funds through the Youthbuild
Program to Los Angeles city and county. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 I. This Notice announces an extension of the deadline for applications for the NOFA for the Opportunities for Youth:
Youthbuild Program which was published on September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49849, until January 31, 1994. The Department
has decided to extend the deadline for all applicants that completed the preparation of an application by the original
application deadline of January 7, 1994, but were unable to meet the submission deadline for all or part of the application
because of weather and other delivery problems. The new deadline is to accommodate applicants who encountered such
problems and is not intended to generate new applications. Applications received by HUD between the original deadline
date of January 7, 1994 and the date of publication of this notice will also be accepted for processing. In addition,
all applicants may revise parts of their applications if they wish and submit the revised parts or the revised application
by the new date of January 31, 1994. 



The Department will announce a new NOFA later this year for the next Youthbuild funding competition. Those parties
interested in developing a new application will have the opportunity to apply for funding consideration during the
next funding round. 

II. The Youthbuild Program, as established by the NOFA published on September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49849, and the proposed
rule also published on September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49830, provides for the Department to reserve up to five percent
of the program funds for emergencies. The Department has decided that the recent earthquake in the Los Angeles area
is such an emergency and that the Department will act promptly on applications received from Los Angeles city and county
and award up to $1.9 million for implementation grants to applicants from Los Angeles. The Department intends to review
the implementation and combined applications received from Los Angeles city and county by the deadline on an immediate
basis. If applications meet the thresholds set forth in the September 23, 1993 NOFA and score at least at the minimum
level (60 points with at least 15 points in capability and 30 points in feasibility and quality), they are eligible
for immediate award. If there are more eligible applications from Los Angeles city and county than can be funded under
the $1.9 million, applications rating the highest will be funded. Any other applications not funded under this emergency
fund will be considered in the regular Youthbuild implementation funding competition.

<DOCTITLE>Central Utah Project Completion Act; Scoping on the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project
EIS</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Central Utah Water Conservancy District, Interior.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of scoping meetings to invite public input for use in preparing the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water
Efficiency Project EIS.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Public Law 102-575 Section 202(a)(3) and 303(b)(3)(a) directs the Central Utah Water Conservancy District
(CUWCD) to conduct, within two years from the date of enactment of this Act, a feasibility study with public involvement,
of efficiency improvements in the management, delivery and treatment of water in Wasatch County; and to construct
a Daniel Replacement pipeline from the Jordanelle Reservoir to the existing Daniel Irrigation Company water regulating
facilities for the purpose of providing a permanent replacement of water in an amount equal to the water being diverted
from the Strawberry watershed (Colorado River Basin) to the Daniels Creek irrigation area. This replacement would
allow the water currently being diverted from streams tributary to Strawberry Reservoir to flow unrestricted into
the reservoir, resulting in improvement to the fishery resources. This improvement is a segment of the aquatic mitigation
plan for the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project.



CUWCD will serve as the joint lead agency with the Secretary of the Interior for preparation of the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch
County Water Efficiency Project EIS pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the NEPA of 1969 as amended and the Central Utah
Project Completion Act.

A Federal Register notice 57 FR 62576 issued on December 31, 1992, announced the CUWCD's intent to prepare an EIS. The
purpose of this notice is to invite the public's participation in the EIS scoping process. The purpose of scoping is
to solicit public input on the scope and content of the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project
EIS.

The EIS for the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project will be prepared in two sections. One
section will evaluate the environmental impact of the Daniel Replacement Project and alternatives for providing
greater water efficiency and certain environmental improvements in Wasatch County, Utah. Preliminary alternatives
to be included in this section of the EIS are: Daniel Replacement Project using only a pipeline to transport the water;
Daniel Replacement Project using a combination of pipeline and enlarging existing canals; Daniel Replacement Project
in combination with efficiency projects (i.e. conversion of flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation) using only
pipelines to convey the water; Daniel Replacement Project in combination with efficiency projects (i.e. conversion
of flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation) with maximum use of existing canals to transport the water; and Daniel
Replacement Project in combination with efficiency projects (i.e. conversion of flood irrigation to sprinkler
irrigation) and use of River Ditch, Wasatch Canal and enlarged Timpanogos Canal to transport the water. The EIS will
also evaluate the impact of the No-Action alternative.

Type of potential issues include impacts to wetlands and downstream water users associated with the conversion from
flood to sprinkler irrigation; impacts associated with flow reduction in upper Daniels Creek; impacts on threatened
and endangered species; and, the impact of restoring the natural flow to several streams in the upper Strawberry River
basin.

The second section of the EIS will cover the Provo River Restoration Prject (PRRP). The principal objective of the
PRRP is to return the Provo River between Jordanelle Dam and Deer Creek Reservoir to a naturally functional state,
wherein long-term dynamic equilibrium and stability would be self-sustaining. Three alternatives for the PRRP
will be analyzed in the EIS. They are: no action, which would consist of making only those improvements (i.e. fisherman
access to the river and installation of in-channel fish habitat enhancement structures) covered by the 1987 Final
Supplement to the Municipal & Industrial System Bonneville Unit EIS; existing channel enhancement, which would
consist of transforming the channel into a step-pool system to the extent possible within the existing flood easements;
and maximum practical restoration which would involve reconstructing essentially the entire river channel as a
meandering riffle-pool system which may extend well beyond the present diked and flood easement area.

Type of potential issues include impacts to wetlands and riparian vegetation; and impact of increased recreational
use along the Provo River corridor on ranching operations.

Final Finding of No Significant Impact and Intent To Terminate Source and Byproduct Material License SUA-1556
To Bingham Engineering, Salt Lake County, UT




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Finding of No Significant Impact and Intent to Terminate Source and Byproduct Material License.






1. Proposed Action


The proposed administrative action is to terminate a source and byproduct material license which will remove the
NRC authorization for Bingham Engineering to extract leachate solution from mill tailings for purposes of clay liner
testing.


2. Reasons for Final Finding of No Significant Impact


Bingham Engineering, holder of Source Material License SUA-1556 never received, held, or transferred byproduct
material. The licensee's proposed project for extraction of uranium mill tailings leachate was never performed.
Therefore, there was no impact to human health or the environment as a consequence of release of radionuclides.
In accordance with 10 CFR 51.33(e), the Director, Uranium Recovery Field Office, made the determination to issue
a final finding of no significant impact in the 

Federal Register

. Concurrent with this finding, NRC will terminate Source and Byproduct Material License SUA-1556 which had
authorized Bingham Engineering to receive and handle 25 kg of byproduct material.
This finding, together with documents setting forth the bases for the finding, are available for public inspection
and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.

IV. Agreement



In order to achieve satisfactory cleanup of the HMC site, NRC and EPA agree to do the following:

1. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the oversight of reclamation and remedial activity at the HMC site.

2. EPA will review the amendments to the site reclamation plan (``the plan'') and will provide comments to NRC. NRC
will review and, if necessary, require revisions to the plan to assure conformance to 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, as
amended, prior to approving the plan via license amendments. NRC will provide EPA with copies of all license amendments
which affect the site closure plan prior to issuance for comment. If no comments are received within 30 calendar days,
NRC will issue the amendment.

3. If EPA determines that remedial actions are deficient or unsatisfactory, then EPA shall provide notice to NRC of
the deficiency. NRC shall assume the lead role for notification to HMC, except for such notification as EPA might statutorily
be required to provide in certain events. The notification shall specify a time period within which regulatory compliance
is expected to be achieved. Should compliance not be achieved in this time period, EPA will assume the lead for taking
or seeking any enforcement action within its area of regulatory responsibility and NRC will assume the lead for any
enforcement actions necessary within its area of regulatory responsibility. Both Parties reserve all rights under
this MOU to take whatever actions are determined to be necessary, including the conduct of remedial actions within
and outside the disposal area, in order to fulfill their regulatory requirements. In any event, no actions affecting
site remediation will be taken by either Party without prior consultation with the other Party.


4. Both Parties shall appoint a facility coordinator who shall be responsible for oversight of the implementation
of this MOU and the activities required herein. The facility coordinators shall be appointed by each Party within
seven (7) days of the effective date of this MOU. Each Party has the right to appoint a new facility coordinator at any
time. Such a change shall be accomplished by notifying the other Party, in writing, at least five (5) days prior to the
appointment, of the name, telephone number, and mailing address of said facility coordinator.

5. The Parties will meet periodically at the request of either Party and at least semiannually insofar as it is necessary
to accomplish the objectives of this MOU. The facility coordinators should communicate with each other on a routine
basis by telephone.

6. The Parties will provide technical advice and any necessary regulatory consultation to one another upon request.

7. The Parties will generally provide each other with copies of all official correspondence and documents related
to remedial actions at the site. The Parties will also normally provide copies of other information upon request.
In the event that one of the Parties does not wish to furnish certain specific information, documents, or correspondence
to the other, then said material shall be identified to the other Party along with the reasons for withholding it.

8. Whenever notice or information is required to be forwarded by one party to another under the terms of this MOU, it
shall be given by and directed to the individuals at the addresses specified as follows:


EPA: Director, Hazardous Waste Management Division (6H), U.S. EPA, Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue, suite 1200, Dallas,
Texas 75202-2733.

NRC: Director, Uranium Recovery Field Office, Region IV, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, P.O. Box 25325, Denver,
Colorado 80225.




9. Routine communications may be exchanged verbally, in person, or by telephone between the Parties to facilitate
the orderly conduct of work contemplated by this MOU. 

10. EPA enforcement documentation provided under this MOU will be kept as exempt material by EPA and NRC, to the extent
legally possible, according to the policies and procedures under 40 CFR part 2 and 10 CFR part 2.790, respectively.

11. The Parties shall notify each other of any pending visits to the HMC property which relate to the site closure plan.
To the extent that they are otherwise authorized to do so, either Party and their consultants may, at their option,
accompany the other Party on such visits.





V. Agency Responsibilities



A. NRC Responsibilities



1. NRC will ensure that the owners/operators of the HMC uranium mill implement an approved reclamation plan that meets
all relevant NRC requirements, including 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, as amended. The reclamation plan will require
HMC to assure long-term stability of the tailings, reduce gamma radiation to background levels, and diminish radon
exhalation to appropriate regulatory standards. If any part of such plan is not complied with by HMC, NRC will take
whatever actions it deems appropriate to ensure compliance.

2. NRC will ensure that the owners/operators of the HMC uranium mill implement a compliance monitoring program for
hazardous constituents that meets all relevant NRC requirements, including 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, for the establishment
of ground water protection standards and points of compliance. NRC will verify implementation by HMC of any required
compliance monitoring and/or ground water corrective action at the HMC uranium mill site resulting from the establishment
of ground water protection standards as soon as such is reviewed and accepted by NRC. If any ground water requirements
are not complied with by HMC, NRC will take appropriate action to ensure compliance.

3. NRC will direct HMC to provide both Parties with copies of major work product submittals as they become available.
Such work products will include a reclamation plan and any other plans and specifications for assessment, remediation,
and monitoring, including all analytical data.

4. NRC agrees to provide EPA with progress reports on HMC's remediation, semiannually.

5. NRC will assist in the development of information to support EPA's deletion of the site from the NPL upon completion
of the remedial action, if appropriate.



B. EPA Responsibilities



1. EPA will provide formalized review, consultation, and comment throughout the entire project.

<TEXT>
 

2. EPA will review and provide comments on the various components of the reclamation plan, groundwater monitoring,
and corrective action submittals, and other related documentation, within timeframes as agreed to between NRC and
EPA. In the event that EPA determines that the implementation of the site reclamation plan, closure activities, and/or
groundwater corrective action has not resulted in, or may not result in, cleanup conditions that meet applicable
or relevant and appropriate requirements under CERCLA, then EPA may take whatever action it deems appropriate.



VI. Dispute Resolution



In the event of a dispute between EPA and NRC concerning site activities, the persons designated by each Agency as facility
coordinators, or in their absence, alternate contact points will attempt to promptly resolve such disputes. If disputes
cannot be resolved at this level, the problem will be referred to the supervisors of these persons for further consultation.
The supervisory referral and resolution process will continue, if necessary to resolve the dispute, to the level
of the Regional Administrators of NRC and EPA. Both Parties shall continue to maintain their respective rights or
responsibilities under this MOU during the dispute resolution process.



VII. Execution and Termination



This agreement shall take effect upon execution by EPA and the NRC. It shall remain in effect for the duration of the
program addressed herein unless terminated by mutual agreement by the two Agencies; or this MOU may be terminated
unilaterally if any of the conditions set forth below are present:

1. The planning or conduct of reclamation plan, closure activities, and/or groundwater cleanup actions fail to meet
standards set forth in the Basis for Agreement (Section II) of this MOU.

2. The site is deleted from the NPL.

3. The site is turned over to the Department of Energy or other responsible State or Federal authority for long-term
care.

4. Regulatory, statutory, or other events occur which make this MOU unnecessary, illegal, or otherwise inappropriate.



VIII. Modification



The Parties may modify this MOU from time to time in order to simplify and/or define the procedures contained herein.
Each Party shall keep the other informed of any relevant proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory
authority, forms, procedures, or priorities. This MOU shall be revised, as necessary, by the adoption of such modifications.
The MOU should be reviewed on an annual basis by both the Director, Uranium Recovery Field Office, Region IV, NRC, and
the Director, Hazardous Waste Management Division, Region 6, EPA, or their designated representatives.



IX. Reservation of Rights



The Parties reserve any and all rights or authority that they may have, including but not limited to legal, equitable,
or administrative rights. This specifically includes EPA's and NRC's authority to conduct, direct, oversee, and/or
require environmental response in connection with the site, as well as the authority to enter the site and require
the production of information, within each of their own areas of responsibility.



X. Severability

<DOCTITLE>Duke Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>






The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-35 issued to Duke Power Company (the licensee) for operation of the Catawba Nuclear Station,
Unit 1, located in York County, South Carolina.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.2.5.3 which currently requires the determination
of the reactor coolant system (RCS) flow rate by precision heat balance measurement at least once per 18 months. The
precision heat balance measurement is used to calculate RCS flow based on gross steam generator thermal output and
measurements of RCS hot and cold leg temperatures. Once the RCS flow is determined by this method, the cold leg elbow
tap flow coefficients are adjusted to reproduce the RCS flow indication determined by the calorimetrics. Recently,
the precision heat balance has been adversely affected by the hot leg temperature streaming effect and has been the
cause of unsubstantiated RCS flow measurement decreases. Changes in the calorimetrics result from changes in core
exit temperature and/or flow distributions that can significantly affect the average T-hot as measured by the hot
leg RTDs. Elbow tap delta-Ps and analytical prediction of flow do not confirm the RCS flow rates determined by the periodic
calorimetrics. It is proposed that the current requirements of TS 4.2.5.3 be changed to require that the RCS flow rate
be determined by measurements at least once per 18 months. By replacing the phrase ``precision heat balance measurement''
with ``measurement,'' this will allow RCS flow determination by elbow tap delta-P measurement. The licensee states
that the elbow tap delta-P method of flow determination was initially used at McGuire Nuclear Station and was dropped
in favor of a precision calorimetric each cycle. At the time, November 1982, McGuire was having difficulty meeting
the TS flow limit and the precision calorimetric was considered more accurate and allowed substantial margin gain.
With the advent of more severe temperature and flow gradients in the hot legs, the precision calorimetrics were affected
and resulted in nonphysical indicated flow decreases in the RCS. The elbow tap delta-P indications will provide an
indication of flow which is not dependent on future changes in hot leg temperature measurement and, therefore, will
provide an improvement in flow surveillance accuracy.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




(1) This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.

No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The change in method of flow measurement will not change the probability
of actuation of any Engineered Safeguard Feature or other device. The actual flow rate will not change. The consequences
of previously-analyzed accidents will not change as a result of the new method of flow measurement.

(2) This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.

No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The elbow taps are already in place, and are used to monitor flow for the Reactor Protection System. They
will not initiate any new events.

(3) This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

As described in [the licensee's application], the change in method of RCS flow measurement will provide a more accurate
indication of the flow. The actual flow rate will not be affected. The revised setpoints for low reactor coolant flow
are driven by changes to statistical allowances and do not represent substantive, or less conservative, changes.
There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By February 25, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local document room located at York County Library, 138 East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina
29730. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held
.If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Loren R. Plisco: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina
28242, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendments dated January 10, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,

January 14, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 29, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc., (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Amex. On January 13, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The Exchange proposes to amend Section 107B (``Equity Linked Term Notes'') of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide'')
to provide for the listing and trading of hybrid dept securities whose value is linked to the performance of an ADR which
is listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities system and subject
to last sale reporting. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and
at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis, for, the Proposed Rule
Change



On May 20, 1993, the Commission approved the Exchange's proposed amendments to Section 107 of the Guide to provide
for the listing and trading of ELNs.
 Subsequently, on December 13, 1993, the Commission approved a proposed rule change to provide alternative capitalization
and trading volume standards applicable to the securities underlying ELNs.

ELNs are intermediate term (two to seven years), non-convertible, hybrid debt securities, the value of which is linked
to the performance of a highly capitalized, actively traded U.S. common stock. ELNs may provide for periodic interest
payments to holders based on fixed or floating rates, or they may be structured as ``zero coupon'' instruments with
no payments to holders prior to maturity.
 ELNs may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity, and they may feature
a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount paid to holders upon maturity. A specific issue of ELNs, for example, may
provide holders with a fixed semi-annual interest payment, a cap of 135% of the issuance price on the maximum amount
to be paid upon maturity, and no minimum floor on the principal to be repaid at maturity. Another issue of ELNs might
offer lower annual payments based upon a floating rate and a minimum floor principal repayment of 75% of the issuance
price. As may be seen, the flexibility available to an issuer of ELNs permits the creation of securities which offers
investors the opportunity to more precisely focus on a specific investment strategy. Since July 1993, the Exchange
has listed and currently trades seven ELNs issues.




ELNs conform to the general listing criteria under Section 107A of the Guide, which provide that issues have: (1) A
minimum public distribution of one million trading units and a minimum of 400 holders; (2) an aggregate market value
of at least $20 million; (3) cash settlement in U.S. dollars and a redemption price of at least three dollars where the
instrument contains such provisions; and (4) assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10
million, and pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years.
 ELNs also conform to the special listing criteria of Section 107B of the Guide which provide that: (1) Each issuer have
a tangible net worth of at least $150 million; (2) the total original issue price of the particular issue of ELNs combined
with all of the issuer's other ELNs listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation system not be greater than 25% of the issuer's tangible net worth
at the time of issuance; (3) each underlying linked stock must have a market capitalization of at least $3 billion,
and a trading volume in the 12-month period preceding listing (in all markets in which the underlying security is traded)
of at least 2.5 million shares; (4) the issuer of the underlying linked stock must be a U.S. reporting company under
the Act; and (5) the issuance of ELNs relating to an underlying linked stock may not exceed 5% of the total outstanding
shares of such stock.

<PARENT> FR940126-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange now proposes to amend Section 107B of the Guide to permit the listing and trading of ELNs linked to actively
traded ADRs, provided that (1) the Exchange has in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement with the primary
Exchange in the home country where the security underlying the ADR trades, or (2) the combined trading volume of the
ADR and other related ADRs (as defined below) occurring in the U.S. ADR market represents (on a share equivalent basis)
at least 50% of the combined worldwide trading volume in the ADR, the security underlying the ADR, other classes of
common stock related to the underlying security, and ADRs overlying such other stock (``other related ADRs'') over
the three month period preceding the date of listing.
 The Exchange will use its best efforts to discover all markets (foreign and U.S.) on which the security underlying
the ADR, and all related securities, trades.
 These proposed changes are in addition to the criteria which are currently in place for the listing of ELNs. 






Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations
(``SROs'') that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 Accordingly, the U.S. ADR market is currently comprised of those SROs that are members of ISG.
 








The Exchange believes that the proposed amendment will benefit investors by expanding the number of securities that
may be linked to ELNs, thereby providing investors with enhanced investment flexibility. The Exchange believes
that it is appropriate to now include ADRs within the existing regulatory framework for ELNs because of the significant
level of U.S. investor interest in both U.S. and non-U.S. highly capitalized and actively traded reporting companies.
Since both the ELNs and the ADRs will be subject to the criteria outlined in sections 107A and 107B of the Guide, and the
Exchange will either have in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement with the primary exchange in the home
country where the security underlying the ADR trades or the ADR will meet the trading volume criteria set forth in section
107B, the Exchange believes that it will have the ability to inquire into potential trading problems or irregularities
with respect to the ELNs and the ADRs to which they are linked. 

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to an perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system. 



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. 



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.

Proposed New Vaccine Information Materials 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public 
Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice with comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As required by Public Law 99-660, CDC developed extensive vaccine information materials for distribution
by health care providers to parents prior to administration of particular vaccines to children. In response to concerns
expressed regarding the length and readability of the materials and the process for development of the materials,
the law was revised by Public Law 103-183 to provide for simplification of the vaccine information materials.
CDC is publishing for public comment proposed new vaccine information materials which comply with the revised law.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title III of Public Law 99-660 (the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986) added a new Title XXI to the
Public Health Service Act. Section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300aa-26) required the Secretary
of Health and Human Services to develop by rule extensive vaccine information materials for distribution by health
care providers to the legal representatives of any child receiving particular vaccines (i.e., diphtheria, tetanus,
pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis vaccines). These vaccine information materials were developed
as required by section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act and were issued as a final rule on October 15, 1991 (56 FR
51798; codified at 42 CFR part 110). Since April 15, 1992, any health care provider who intends to 
administer one of the covered vaccines is required to provide copies of vaccine information materials that comply
with the requirements of section 2126 prior to administration of these vaccines. 



Based on concerns expressed by providers and others concerning the length and readability of the vaccine information
materials (each of the three existing vaccine information pamphlets is 10 pages long) and the lengthy development
and revision process required by the rulemaking process (development of the materials took approximately three
years), the Department proposed legislation to amend section 2126 to provide for simplification of the vaccine information
materials. Congress in section 708 of Public Law 103-183, which was enacted on December 14, 1993, revised section
2126 to: (1) Delete the requirement for development and revision of the vaccine information materials by rulemaking;
(2) simplify the information to be included in the materials; and (3) clarify that the materials must not only be provided
to the parent or legal representative of a child receiving a covered vaccine, but also must be provided to any adult
who receives a covered vaccine. 

Section 2126, as amended by Public Law 103-183, requires that information contained in the materials be based
on available data and information, be presented in understandable terms, and include:

(1) A concise description of the benefits of the vaccine, 
(2) A concise description of the risks associated with the vaccine, 
(3) A statement of the availability of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and 
(4) Such other relevant information as may be determined by the Secretary. 

New vaccine information materials which comply with the provisions of the revised section 2126 have been drafted
and are contained in this Notice. We invite comment on these draft information materials. During the 60-day comment
period, CDC also intends to consult with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, health care provider and
parent organizations, and the Food and Drug Administration, as mandated under section 2126. 

CDC intends to repeal the vaccine information materials currently contained in Appendix A of 42 CFR part 110 when the
new vaccine information materials developed under the revised section 2126 of the PHS Act, as revised by Public Law
103-183, are finalized. 

CDC invites written comment on the following proposed vaccine information materials, entitled ``Diphtheria, Tetanus,
and Pertussis Vaccine (DTP): What You Need to Know Before Your Child Gets the Vaccine,'' ``Measles, Mumps, and Rubella
Vaccine (MMR): What You Need to Know Before Your Child Gets the Vaccine,'' ``Polio Vaccine: What You Need to Know Before
Your Child Gets the Vaccine,'' and ``Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine (Td): What You Need to Know Before You Get the Vaccine.''




Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (DTP): What You Need to Know Before Your Child Gets the Vaccine
 


What Are Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis? 



DTP vaccine (DTP) is named for 3 diseases: Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis. Each of these diseases can lead to serious
problems, even death. Your child can be protected from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis by the vaccine. These diseases_especially
pertussis_are still found in our country, mostly because some people do not get enough doses of the vaccines. 

Diphtheria is spread from person to person. It can cause a membrane to form in the nose, throat, or airway. Diphtheria
can cause breathing problems, heart failure, or paralysis. 

Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is caused by a germ that enters the body through a cut or wound. Tetanus causes serious,
painful spasms of all muscles, ``locking'' of the jaw so the sick person cannot open his mouth or swallow, and death.

Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is caused by a germ that 
easily passes from person to person. It can cause serious spells 
of coughing and choking for several weeks. For infants, having 
pertussis makes it hard to eat, drink, or breathe. It can lead 
to pneumonia, seizures, and sometimes even to lasting brain 
damage.



Should Everyone Get the DTP Vaccine?



Experts believe that almost all young children should get DTP or 
DTaP (a new form of the vaccine). To help your doctor/nurse know 
what is best for your child, please answer these questions.

Has the child getting the vaccine had DTP or DTaP in the 
past?






XXXX

Yes (please answer all the questions)


XXXX

No (you can skip these 6 questions)






Please tell your doctor/nurse if the child getting the 
vaccine:

 Has signs of illness today.

 Has ever had a seizure.

 Has a parent, brother, or sister who has had seizures.

If the answer is ``yes'' to any of these questions, your 
doctor/nurse might suggest getting DTP or DTaP, coming back for 
it later, not getting it at all, keeping the fever down after 
getting the shot, or using DT (a vaccine that protects from 
diphtheria and tetanus, but not from pertussis).



When Should Your Child Get the DTP Vaccine?



To be protected against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, most 
children need a total of 5 doses of vaccine. Children should get 
vaccine at:




2 months of age
4 months of age
6 months of age
15 to 18 months of age
4 to 6 years of age




A vaccine called DTaP vaccine is now available. DTaP or DTP may 
be used for the 4th and 5th shots.

These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood 
vaccines.

Every 10 years all through life, everyone needs a booster with 
tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td).

Are There Risks With DTP?



The DTP vaccine is the best way to protect your child against 
these 3 serious diseases. But there are risks with any medicine, 
including vaccines. There is a very small chance that serious 
problems, even death, could occur after getting vaccines. The 
risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the 
diseases.

About half the children who get DTP will not have any problems at 
all. Some will have minor problems like: soreness, redness, or 
swelling where the shot is given; fever; fussiness; drowsiness; 
less appetite. Rarely, after DTP such problems have been noted 
as: crying non-stop for 3 hours or more; fever of 105
 F or 
higher; seizures (usually caused by fever); collapse or fainting. 
None of these problems is known to cause any lasting harm, but 
they are scary. Very rarely, DTP causes long seizures, decreased 
consciousness, or coma that does not last. Also very rarely, DT, 
Td, and the diphtheria-tetanus part of DTP and DTaP cause severe 
allergic problems or Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome (sudden weakness and 
numbness that may go on to paralysis). Lasting brain damage 
after DTP has not been proven. If DTP ever causes lasting brain 
damage, it is very rare. 

DTaP causes fewer of the minor problems than DTP does. Experts 
do not know if the rare serious problems reported after DTP 
happen less often after DTaP. 

If a serious or unusual problem occurs after getting any vaccine, 
call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away. 



What is the Injury Compensation Program?



The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a U.S. 
government program that gives compensation (payment) for some 
persons thought to be injured by vaccines. For facts about this 
program, call this toll-free number: 1-800-338-2382.

If you believe that the person getting the vaccine had a serious 
problem because of the vaccine, tell the doctor/nurse or health 
department. Ask him or her to report the problem on a Vaccine 
Adverse Event Report form. If you want to report it yourself, 
you can get the form by calling this toll-free number: 
1-800-822-7967.

Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine (MMR) 
What You Need to Know Before Your Child Gets the Vaccine 



What are Measles, Mumps, and Rubella? 



MMR vaccine is named for 3 diseases: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. 
Each of these diseases can lead to serious problems, even death. 
Your child can be protected from measles, mumps, and rubella by 
the vaccine. These diseases are still found in our country, 
mostly because some people do not get the vaccines. 

Measles is spread easily from person to person, causing a rash, 
cough, and high fever. When children catch measles, some of them 
also get ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, seizures, hearing 
loss, or brain damage. 

Mumps also is easily passed from person to person. It usually 
causes fever, headache, and swollen glands under the jaw. It can 
also cause meningitis (an inflammation of the brain and spinal 
cord coverings), inflammation of the brain, or hearing loss. Men 
can get painful, swollen testicles from mumps. 

Rubella is also called German measles. It also passes from 
person to person. It causes a mild fever, swollen glands, and a 
rash. Sometimes it also causes arthritis (inflamed joints), 
especially in women. If a pregnant woman catches rubella, it is 
very dangerous for her unborn baby. Many women who have rubella 
when they are pregnant will lose their babies or have babies born 
with deafness, blindness, heart disease, brain damage, or other 
serious problems. 



Should Everyone Get the MMR Vaccine? 


Experts believe that almost all young children should get MMR. 
To help your doctor/nurse know what is best for your child, 
please answer the following questions. 




 

Please tell your doctor/nurse if the person getting the vaccine: 

 Has signs of illness today. 
 Has a parent, brother, or sister who has had seizures. 
 Has ever had a seizure. 
 Has gotten immune globulin or other blood products (such as a transfusion) during the past several months?


If the answer is ``yes'' to any of these questions, your doctor/nurse 
might suggest getting the shot, coming back for it later, or not 
getting it at all.

When Should Your Child Get the MMR Vaccine? 



Most children should have a total of 2 MMR vaccines. They should 
get vaccine at: 




12 to 15 months of age AND 

when starting school OR when starting middle school or 
junior high school 




These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood 
vaccines. 

People who do not know if they are protected against measles, 
mumps, and rubella should ask their doctor/nurse about getting 
MMR. 



Are There Risks With MMR? 



The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect your child against 
these 3 serious diseases. But there are risks with any medicine, 
including vaccines. There is a very small chance that serious 
problems, even death, could occur after getting vaccines. The 
risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the 
diseases. 

Most people who get MMR will not have any problems at all. Some 
will have minor problems like: soreness, redness, or swelling 
where the shot is given; mild fever; rash; a little swelling of 
the glands in the cheeks, neck, or under the jaw. Occasionally, 
pain, stiffness, or swelling in the joints (arthritis) may occur, 
usually 1-3 weeks after getting the vaccine. The arthritis 
usually does not last long. Occasionally, it lasts or comes and 
goes for months or longer. Young women are more likely than 
children to have joint problems. 

Rarely, more serious problems may come within 3 weeks of getting 
MMR. Usually they do not cause lasting harm. These rare 
problems include: Severe allergic problems; seizures (usually 
caused by fever); and low number of platelets (a type of blood 
cells). Other rare serious problems have been seen after MMR was 
given, but it is not known if the vaccine caused the problems. 
These problems are even more rare than the ones above and include 
hearing loss and inflammation of the brain that could lead to 
lasting damage. 

If a serious or unusual problem occurs after getting any vaccine, 
call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away.

problem because of the vaccine, tell the doctor/nurse or health 
department. Ask him or her to report the problem on a Vaccine 
Adverse Event Report form. If you want to report it yourself, 
you can get the form by calling this toll-free number:

Polio Vaccine What you Need To Know Before Your 
Child Gets the Vaccine 



What Is Polio? 



Polio is a serious disease that can cause life-long paralysis 
(that is, victims cannot move parts of their bodies). Some polio 
victims cannot breathe without the help of a machine. They may 
even die. Your child can be protected from polio by the 
vaccine. Polio is very rare in our country, mostly because 
people are protected by polio vaccine. 

There are 2 kinds of polio vaccine: 


OPV or Oral Polio Vaccine. OPV is given by mouth as drops. 
Most experts recommend OPV for healthy children. 

IPV or Inactivated Polio Vaccine. IPV is a shot. 



Should Everyone Get the Polio Vaccine? 



Experts believe that almost all young children should get polio 
vaccine. To help your doctor/nurse know what is best for your 
child, please answer the following questions. 







If so, the person who never got the polio vaccine should 
talk to her/his doctor/nurse about getting IPV. 



When Should Your Child Get the Polio Vaccine? 



Most children should have a total of 4 polio vaccines. They 
should get vaccine at: 





2 months of age
4 months of age
 6 to 18 months of age
 4 to 6 years of age 




These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood 
vaccines. 

Before travel to countries where polio still occurs, adults and 
children should get at least 1 more dose of either OPV (if they 
had OPV before) or IPV. Your doctor/nurse can tell you how many 
doses are needed. 



Are There Risks With Polio Vaccine? 



The polio vaccine is the best way to protect your child against 
this serious disease. But there are risks with any medicine, 
including vaccines. There is a very small chance that serious 
problems, even death, could occur after getting vaccines. The 
risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the 
disease.

OPV.

 Almost all people who get OPV will not have any problems at all. Extremely rarely, a person will get polio from the first
dose of vaccine and, even more rarely, from a later dose. 

Children who recently got OPV have the vaccine virus in their throats for a week and in their stool for a month or sometimes
longer. People who have close contact (for example, kissing or changing diapers) with someone who got OPV can get infected
by the virus. Extremely rarely, if they have not already gotten the vaccine against polio, they can get polio disease.
If you have a 
child getting OPV and you never got the polio vaccine, ask your doctor/nurse about getting IPV for yourself. 



IPV.

 Inactivated polio vaccine is not known to cause any problems other than a little soreness or redness where the shot

is given. 

If a serious or unusual problem occurs after getting any vaccine, 
call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away. 



What is the Injury Compensation Program?



The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a U.S. government program that gives compensation (payment)
for some persons thought to be injured by vaccines. For facts about this program, call this toll-free number: 1-800-338-2382.


If you believe that the person getting the vaccine had a serious problem because of the vaccine, tell the doctor/nurse
or health department. Ask him or her to report the problem on a Vaccine Adverse Event Report form. If you want to report
it yourself, you can get the form by calling this toll-free number: 
1-800-822-7967.

Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine (Td) What You Need To Know Before You Get the Vaccine




What Are Tetanus and Diphtheria?




Td vaccine is named for 2 diseases: 

T

etanus and 

d

iphtheria. These diseases can lead to serious problems, even death. You can be protected from tetanus and diphtheria
by the vaccine. These diseases are still found in our country, mostly because some people do not get enough doses of
the vaccines. 


Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is caused by a germ that enters the body through a cut or wound. Tetanus causes serious,
painful spasms of all muscles, ``locking'' of the jaw so the sick person cannot open his mouth or swallow, and death.



Diphtheria is spread from person to person. It can cause a membrane to form in the nose, throat, or airway. Diphtheria
can cause breathing problems, heart failure, or paralysis. 




Should Everyone Get the Td Vaccine?





Td is made for people 7 years of age and older. 


If you had an allergic problem that required a medical visit right after any vaccine for tetanus or diphtheria (for
example, DT, DTP, DTaP), talk to your doctor/nurse about the problem before getting Td. 


Tell your doctor/nurse if you: 


 Have signs of illness today.


 Are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.





When Should You Get the Td Vaccine?





To be protected against tetanus and diphtheria, a Td dose is needed every 10 years all through life. 




Are There Risks With Td?





The Td vaccine is the best way to protect yourself against these serious diseases. But there are risks with any medicine,
including vaccines. There is a very small chance that serious problems, even death, could occur after getting vaccines.
The risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the diseases. 


Most people who get Td will not have any problems at all. Some will have minor problems like soreness, redness, or swelling
where the shot was given. Most persons 7 years of age and older have had doses of DTP, DTaP, and/or DT, and should be given
Td only once every 10 years. If adults get this vaccine very often, they can have a lot of soreness and swelling where
the shot was given. Very rarely, Td causes severe allergic problems or Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome (sudden weakness
and numbness that may go on to paralysis). 


If a serious or unusual problem occurs after getting any vaccine, call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away.





What Is the Injury Compensation Program?





The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a U.S. government program that gives compensation (payment)
for some persons thought to be injured by vaccines. For facts about this program, call this toll-free number: 1-800-338-2382.



If you believe that the person getting the vaccine had a serious problem because of the vaccine, tell the doctor/nurse
or health department. Ask him or her to report the problem on a Vaccine Adverse Event Report form. If you want to report
it yourself, you can get the form by calling this toll-free number: 1-800-822-7967.

 Notice of Availability and Request for Comments on Proposed Ambient Water Quality Criteria Documents for the Protection
of Aquatic Life; Extension of Comment Period and Correction to Table. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to extend the comment period for and make corrections to the table in 58 FR 61910 entitled
``Ambient Water Quality Criteria Aniline and 2,4-Dimethylphenol.'' 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background Information 



Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting
the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic
life and recreation. 

The draft criteria announced in 58 FR 61910 are intended to protect aquatic life and were derived using the 1985 ``Guidelines
for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses''
(50 FR 30784). All of the criteria developed by EPA using this methodology are summarized in Quality Criteria for Water
1986 (1986 ``Gold Book'') (which is updated periodically.) 

EPA's criteria documents provide a comprehensive aquatic toxicological evaluation of each chemical. For toxic
pollutants, the documents tabulate the relevant acute and chronic toxicity information for aquatic life and derive
the criteria maximum concentrations (acute criteria) and criteria continuous concentrations (chronic criteria)
which the Agency recommends to protect aquatic life resources. The proposed criteria announced today are not intended
to protect human health and do not address human health concerns.

Correction of Table



This notice corrects a table in the 

Federal Register

 notice on the availability of draft documents proposing Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the protection of aquatic
life for two chemicals which appeared at 58 FR 61910. In the table on page 61911, the column headed Proposed FW acute
criterion for the entry Aniline is corrected to read 28  u g/L and the column headed Proposed FW chronic criterion
for the entry Aniline is corrected to read 14  u g/L. The table as corrected is shown below: 







Request for Comments 


EPA is soliciting comments on the proposed criteria documents and extending the comment period for an additional
60 days to March 25, 1994. If issued in final form, the proposed documents would supersede material specific to the
aquatic life toxicity of these chemicals as published in any previous ambient water quality criteria documents.
Specifically, Acute and Chronic Criteria for the protection of aquatic life within proposed ``Ambient Aquatic Life
Water Quality Criteria for 2,4-DIMETHYLPHENOL'' would, upon finalization, supersede guidance given in the previous
Ambient Water Quality Criteria for 2,4-dimethylphenol (USEPA, 1980). The proposed criteria were derived using
improved procedures and additional information. 

The Agency is soliciting additional toxicological data on the pollutants covered by today's notice. Data suitable
(as specified in the Agency's guidelines for developing aquatic life criteria) for determining the bioconcentration
of Aniline in freshwater (FW) or saltwater (SW) organisms is of particular interest. The Agency is also soliciting
comments on the scientific basis for the criteria values, the appropriate analytical techniques for measuring attainment
of criteria, and the allowable duration and frequency for exceeding the criteria. The proposed criteria announced
today, if published in final form, would serve as guidance to the States in developing water quality standards pursuant
to 40 CFR part 131.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC), established under section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA), transmitted its Thirty-Third Report to the Administrator of EPA on November 29, 1993. As noted in this Report,
which is included with this notice, the ITC revised the 

Priority Testing List

 by removing 2 chemicals and 4 chemical groups from the 

List

 for priority consideration by the EPA Administrator for promulgation of test rules under section 4(a) of the Act.
The chemicals being removed are 2,4-dinitrophenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol. The groups being removed are imidazolium
and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds (8 chemicals), brominated flame retardants (23 chemicals), and
alkyl phosphates (20 chemicals). The Report indicates that removal of these chemicals and chemical groups from the


List

 should be interpreted only as a reordering of priorities and not a statement that the testing recommended earlier
has been completed or is not needed. Prior to removing chemicals from the 

List

, the ITC reviewed about 80 TSCA section 8(a) reports and 850 TSCA section 8(d) studies. The ITC is sharing summaries
of these reviews with appropriate EPA programs offices and other concerned Federal agencies to assist them in risk
assessment and management activities.



There are no additions to the 

Priority Testing List

.

EPA invites interested persons to submit written comments on the Report.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA has received the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee's Thirty-Third Report to the Administrator.



I. Background 



TSCA (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq; 15 U.S.C. 260l et seq.) authorizes the Administrator of EPA to promulgate
regulations under section 4(a) requiring testing of chemicals and chemical groups in order to develop data relevant
to determining the risks that such chemicals and chemical groups may present to health or the environment. Section
4(e) of TSCA established the Interagency Testing Committee to recommend chemicals and chemical groups to the Administrator
of EPA for priority testing consideration. Section 4(e) directs the ITC to revise the TSCA section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

 at least every 6 months. The most recent revisions to this 

List

 are included in the ITC's Thirty-Third Report. The Report was received by the Administrator on November 29, 1993,
and is included in this Notice. The Report removes two chemicals and four chemical groups from the TSCA section 4(e)


Priority Testing List

.

These chemical substances and chemical groups were previously added to the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data
Reporting Rule (40 CFR part 716) in response to the ITC testing recommendations. These substances will be considered
for removal from the 8(d) rule during the next 8(d) rule ``biennial review,'' scheduled to occur during 1995. See 40
CFR 716.65(b).



II. Written and Oral Comments



EPA invites interested persons to submit detailed comments on the ITC's Report. All submissions should bear the identifying
docket number (OPPT-41040).



III. Status of List



The ITC's Thirty-Third Report notes the removal of 2 chemicals and 4 chemical groups from the 

Priority Testing List

. The current TSCA section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

 contains 16 chemicals and 12 chemical groups, with two chemical groups and 7 chemicals designated for testing.

Thirty-Third Report Of The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee To The Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency 





Summary:

 This is the 33rd Report of the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). The ITC is revising its 

Priority Testing List

 by removing two chemicals and four chemical groups. The chemicals being removed are 2,4-dinitrophenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol.
The groups being removed are imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds, brominated flame retardants,
and alkyl phosphates. These revisions are based on current priorities of ITC Member agencies and a review of production
and exposure reports and health and safety studies submitted by manufacturers, processors, and distributors for
these chemicals and chemical groups. 



I. Background



The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) was established by subsection 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) ``to make recommendations to the Administrator respecting the chemical substances and mixtures to which
the Administrator should give priority consideration for the promulgation of a rule for testing under subsection
4(a)... At least every 6 months..., the Committee shall make such revisions in the 

List

 as it determines to be necessary and to transmit them to the Administrator together with the Committee's reasons for
the revisions'' (Public Law 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq., 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). Since its creation in 1976,
the ITC has submitted 32 semi-annual Reports to the EPA Administrator transmitting the 

Priority Testing List

 and its revisions. These Reports have been published in the 

Federal Register

 and are available from the ITC. The ITC meets monthly and produces its revisions with the help of staff and technical
contract support provided by EPA. ITC membership and support personnel are listed at the end of this Report.

Following receipt of the ITC's Report, the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics may promulgate TSCA subsection
8(a) and 8(d) rules that require manufacturers, processors, and/or distributors of chemicals on the 

Priority Testing List

 to submit production and exposure data (8a), and health and safety studies (8d), within 2 months of the rules' effective
dates. The submissions are indexed and maintained by EPA. The ITC reviews the 8(a) and 8(d) information and other available
data on chemicals and chemical groups to determine if revisions to the 

Priority Testing List

 are necessary. Revisions include changing a recommendation to a designation for action by the Administrator within
12 months, modifying the recommended testing, or removing the chemical or group from the 

List

.

The substituted phenols were recommended for testing in 1990 and the chemical groups were added to the 

Priority Testing List

 following the Committee's 1986 sixth scoring exercise (Ref. 1). The sixth scoring exercise was a systematic, computerized
chemical selection procedure for identifying chemicals of concern, further defined by chemical substructural
features (Ref. 5). 



II. Revisions to the TSCA Section 4(e) Priority Testing List



The ITC removes the following chemicals and chemical groups from the TSCA Section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

 (Table 1). 






III. Rationale for the revisions 

A. ITC's Activities During this Reporting Period



During the 6 months covered by this Report, May through October 1993, the ITC reviewed the 8(a) and 8(d) submissions
and other available data for chemicals and chemical groups recommended in its 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 26th, and 27th Reports.
The 

Federal Register

 citations for the 8(a) and 8(d) rules and the number of 8(d) studies reviewed by the ITC for each chemical or chemical
group are summarized in the following Table 2. Approximately 80 TSCA 8(a) reports were reviewed by the ITC; but the
exact number is not reported for each chemical or group to protect TSCA Confidential Business Information. 






Also during this reporting period, the ITC reevaluated the priority for testing these chemicals and chemical groups
at the urging of EPA in view of current EPA and Member agency priorities. The ITC has determined that the chemicals and
groups listed in its recent Reports are of higher priority than some of the chemicals recommended in earlier Reports
and is reordering priorities to reflect this determination. For the chemicals removed from the 

List

, the ITC will forward to the appropriate EPA program office(s), or other Federal Government organizations, its review
of 8(d) studies and other relevant information to assist them in risk assessment and management activities, regulatory
actions, or for renomination to the TSCA section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

. The ITC will also include these TSCA 8(d) summary reports in the public docket supporting this ITC Report. In those
cases in which the testing recommendations originally made by the ITC have not been met, the ITC encourages manufacturers,
processors, and distributors of the remo
