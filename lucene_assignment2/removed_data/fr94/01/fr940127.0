Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Inter-American Foundation 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Inter-American Foundation. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Inter-American Foundation (``Foundation''), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE),
is issuing regulations for employees of the Foundation that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees
of the Executive Branch at 5 CFR part 2635. The Foundation is also repealing its regulations that were superseded by
these standards and by the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published a final rule entitled ``Standards of Ethical Conduct
for Employees of the Executive Branch'' (Standards). See 57 FR 35006-35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57
FR 52583. The Standards, codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and effective February 3, 1993, established uniform standards
of ethical conduct that apply to all executive branch personnel. 
With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive branch agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental
regulations necessary to implement their respective ethics programs. The Foundation, with OGE's concurrence,
has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in part 7301 of new chapter LXIII of 5
CFR, are necessary to the successful implementation of the Foundation's ethics program. By this rulemaking, the
Foundation is also repealing its regulations at 22 CFR part 1001 which have been superseded by the Standards and by
OGE regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, Executive Branch Financial Disclosure, Qualified Trusts, and Certificates of
Divestiture. 


II. Analysis of the Regulations 



Section 7301.101 General 


New  7301.101(a) of 5 CFR explains that the supplemental regulations apply to employees of the Inter-American
Foundation, with the exception of members of the Foundation's Board of Directors and Advisory Council, and supplement
the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. Section 7301.101(a)
also provides a cross-reference to the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR
part 2634. 
The head of each executive branch agency is required by 5 CFR 2638.202(b) to appoint a designated agency ethics official
and an alternate agency ethics official to carry out the duties specified in 5 CFR 2638.203. Section 7301.101(b) specifies
that the Foundation's General Counsel will serve as its designated agency ethics official and that the Deputy General
Counsel will serve as the alternate agency ethics official. Section 7301.102 of these supplemental regulations
gives the designated agency ethics official and the alternate the additional responsibility of approving requests
for prior approval to engage in compensated outside teaching, speaking and writing activities.

Section 7301.102 Prior Approval for Outside Teaching, Speaking and Writing


Under 5 CFR 2635.803, an agency that determines it is necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering its ethics
program may, by supplemental regulation, require its employees to obtain prior approval before engaging in specific
types of outside activities. Under 22 CFR 1001.5(c), which is being repealed by this final rule, the Foundation has
required its employees to obtain prior approval to engage in outside teaching, lecturing or writing. To ensure compliance
with the executive branch-wide limitations on teaching, speaking and writing at 5 CFR 2635.807, and based on its experiences
with the similar requirement that has been in effect under 22 CFR 1001.5(c), the Foundation has determined that it
is desirable for the administration of its ethics program to continue to require Foundation employees to obtain prior
approval to engage in compensated teaching, speaking and writing. Section 7301.102 (a), thus, imposes such a requirement
for prior approval by the designated agency ethics official or the alternate agency ethics official. To ensure that
approval is granted in accordance with applicable standards, 5 CFR 7301.102(b) provides that approval shall be granted
only upon a determination that the outside teaching, speaking or writing is not expected to involve conduct prohibited
by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635. 


III. Repeal of Foundation Employee Responsibilities and Conduct Regulations 


Because the Foundation's regulations on Employees Responsibilities and Conduct have been superseded by the new
executive branch standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure regulations, 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, the
Foundation is repealing all of existing 22 CFR part 1001. To ensure that Foundation employees are on notice of the ethical
standards and financial disclosure requirements to which they are subject, the Foundation is replacing its old standards
at 22 CFR part 1001 with a new standard at 22 CFR 1001.1 which cross-references 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, as well as the
Foundation's supplemental regulations at 5 CFR part 7301. 


IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure 


Administrative Procedure Act 


In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d)(3)), the Foundation has found that good
cause exists for waiving as unnecessary and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking
and the 30-day delay in effectiveness as to the rules and repeals. Public comment is unnecessary because these regulations
merely revoke existing regulations in accordance with previously issued Government-wide regulations and make
non-substantive amendments. In addition, since these regulations relate to agency management and personnel they
are exempt from notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. 553 (a)(2). 


Executive Order 12866 


In promulgating these final regulations, the Foundation has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable
principles of regulation set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. These regulations
have not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order, as they deal with agency organization,
management, and personnel matters and are not, in any event, deemed ``significant'' thereunder. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Foundation has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that these regulations will not have a significant impact on small business entities because they affect only Foundation
employees.

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Foundation has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not apply because these
regulations do not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management
and Budget.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Title XII, section 1237 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 to specify the number of acres the Secretary of Agriculture shall enroll in the Wetlands Reserve Program
(WRP). This interim rule amends the regulations governing the WRP to comply with statutory changes; expand the number
of participating States from 9 States to 20 States; revise the process by which the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service (ASCS) enrolls acreage in the WRP; and provide other changes based on experience in administering
the 1992 Pilot WRP.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 








This interim rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review under Executive Order 12866. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act 




It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this rule because ASCS is not required
by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rule making with respect to the subject matter
of this rule. 



Environmental Evaluation 




It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have any significant adverse impact
on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment
is not needed. Copies of a final environmental evaluation are available upon request. 



Executive Order 12372




This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 because it involves direct payments
to individuals and not to State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48
FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). 




Federal Domestic Assistance Program


The title and number of the Federal Domestic Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,
to which this rule applies are: Wetlands Reserve Program_10.072.

Paperwork Reduction Act 





The information collection requirements of this interim rule at 
7 CFR part 703 have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for expedited approval under provisions of
44 U.S.C. chapter 33. Approval of the forms is requested by February 1, 1994. The public reporting burden for the information
collections that would be required for compliance with these regulations is estimated to average 39 minutes per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 




Executive Order 12778 





This interim rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive 
Order 12778. The provisions of this interim rule are not retroactive and preempt State and local laws to the extent
such laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this interim rule. Before an action may be brought in a Federal court
of competent jurisdiction, the administrative appeal rights afforded program participants at 7 CFR part 780 must
be exhausted. 




Discussion of Program 





The current regulations in 7 CFR part 703, published as a final rule on June 4, 1992 (57 FR 23908), implemented the 1992
pilot WRP, which is authorized by title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended (1985 Act). Under the WRP, ASCS
will purchase easements, in lump-sum payments, from persons owning cropland who voluntarily agree to restore and
protect farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, substantially altered lands, and eligible adjacent acres.
Fund and acreage allocations will be provided to States based on landowner interest and other factors as determined
by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, ASCS, in consultation with the Soil Conservation Service
and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Land eligible for enrollment in the WRP includes farmed wetlands, prior converted
croplands, but not lands converted after December 23, 1985, or substantially altered lands, together with adjacent
lands on which the wetlands are functionally dependent so long as the likelihood of successful restoration of such
land and the wetland values merit inclusion in the program taking into account the cost of restoring the wetlands.
ASCS is also permitted to include in the program: 



(1) Farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, or substantially altered lands and adjoining lands which are enrolled
in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as authorized by title XII of the 1985 Act, with the highest wetland functions
and values and that are likely to return to production at the end of the CRP contract; 



(2) Other wetlands that would not otherwise be eligible if it is determined that inclusion in the program would add
to the value of the easement; and 



(3) Riparian areas that link wetlands which are protected by easements or by some other device or circumstance that
achieves the same purpose as an easement. 



Landowners are not eligible to receive funding under both the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the WRP on
the same acreage. ECP payments received on acreage offered for WRP must be refunded, provided the ECP practice is still
within its lifespan provisions, before any WRP payment will be disbursed. 



This interim rule does not impact the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program as authorized by the Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations for Relief From the Major, Widespread Flooding in the Midwest Act of 1993 
(Pub. L. 103-75). 




Statutory Changes 





During fiscal year 1992, WRP was authorized in the following States: California, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Section 1237 of the 1985 Act was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 to specify that the Secretary shall enroll in the WRP a total of not less than 330,000 acres by the end of 1995
and a total of not less than 975,000 acres during 1991 through 2000. Congress has appropriated $66,675,000 to be used
to enroll no more than 75,000 acres in fiscal year 1994. 



This interim rule amends 7 CFR part 703 for WRP to: 



(1) With respect to fiscal year 1994 only, identify enrollment availability in 20 States, including the nine States
in the fiscal year 1992 pilot program; 



(2) Provide for the appraisal for easements by licensed appraisers who are also approved by ASCS; and 



(3) Make other changes based on experience gained from administering the pilot WRP in fiscal year 1992. 




List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 703 





Administrative practices and procedures, Appraisals, Compliance procedures, Easements, Natural resources,
Technical assistance, Wetlands Reserve Plan of Operations (WRPO). 






Accordingly, 7 CFR part 703 is amended as follows: 




PART 703_WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM 





1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 703 is revised to read as follows: 





Authority:

 Public Law 99-198, 107 Stat. 739; 16 U.S.C. 3837 

et. seq. 






2. Section 703.1 is revised to read as follows: 


 703.1

Applicability. 





(a) The regulations in this part govern the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). For fiscal year 1992 only, the WRP shall
be available to producers in California, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina,
and Wisconsin. For fiscal year 1994 only, the WRP shall be available in these nine States and in Arkansas, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. These states have
been determined to have a high incidence of: 



(1) Significant acreage of hydric cropland; 



(2) Potential capacity of restoration; 



(3) Diversity in kinds of wetlands; or 



(4) Substantial benefits for migratory birds and other wildlife. 



(b) Under the WRP, ASCS will accept voluntary offers of acreage for the purchase of easements from eligible persons
who have eligible land with respect to which they agree to restore and protect farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands,
or substantially altered lands, and eligible adjacent lands. Such voluntary easements will be for the purpose of
restoring the hydrology and vegetation and protecting the functions and values of wetlands for wildlife habitat,
water quality improvement, flood water retention, ground water recharge, open space, aesthetic values, environmental
education, and other values determined appropriate by ASCS. 



 703.2

[Amended] 





3. In  703.2, paragraph (f)(1) is amended by removing the words ``cost of the restoration'' and adding in their
place, the words ``costs of restoration and of acquiring the easement'', and paragraph (f)(2) is amended by inserting
the word ``not'' after the word ``will''. 



4. Section 703.3(b) is amended by: 



A. Revising the definitions of ``Bid'', ``Non-permanent easement'', ``Participant'', and ``Permanent easement'',

Supervised Bank Accounts and Multi-Housing Reserve Funds 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farmers Home Administration, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulations to require Multi-Family Housing (MFH) reserve accounts
be subject to countersignature by an Agency official before funds can be withdrawn. Internal Agency reviews and audits
conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) indicate reserve funds are being improperly used. The intended
effect of this action is to curtail reserve fund abuses. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Classification 



We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: (1)
Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an
action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.




Intergovernmental Consultation 



The programs affected are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under Numbers 10.405_Farm Labor Housing
Loans and Grants, 10.415_Rural Rental Housing Loans, and 10.427_Rural Rental Assistance Payments, and are subject
to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
(7 CFR part 3105, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983; 49 FR 2267, May 31, 1984; 59 FR 14088, April 10, 1985) 



Environmental Impact Statement 



This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the
determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 



Civil Justice Reform 



This regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in
sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with state law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit. 



Discussion 



The Agency is improving FmHA oversight of MFH reserve accounts by requiring them to be subject to countersignature
in a supervised account. Reserve accounts were previously required to be funded and used in accordance with Agency
regulations, which already required the prior consent of the Agency prior to withdrawing reserve funds. However,
internal Agency reviews and audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), highlighted various violations
of Agency regulations and prompted the need for this final rulemaking action. 

Among the most common concerns uncovered to date include the withdrawal of reserve funds without Agency consent,
funds being pledged as security for other loans without Agency knowledge, withdrawal of interest earned on reserve
funds for non-project purposes, lenders withdrawing funds for application on other defaulted loans, reserve funds
withdrawn at a lending institution for application on other debts, and reserve accounts held at a lending institution
for a short period of time before transferring to another institution. 

The Agency expects to curtail reserve fund abuses by shifting emphasis to compliance through procedures aimed at
preventing abuses (e.g., requiring the countersignature of Agency officials for withdrawal of reserve funds which
are to be placed in a supervised account). The Agency's earlier procedures relied on oversight through monitoring
routines, with the threat of potential punitive measures being imposed should violations be discovered. 

The Agency solicited comments concerning the impact of the proposed rules on those holding reserve funds in money
market accounts, bonds, or financial holdings other than in checking or savings accounts in federally insured institutions.
The prior rulemaking action also mentioned that the Agency is aware that the proposed rule may result in some borrowers
having to pay financial fees or penalties, which will erode reserve funds, and is concerned that such adverse impacts
be minimized to the extent practical. The Agency also solicited other alternative approaches to curtail reserve
account abuses. The Agency desires to ensure that the rules to reduce reserve account abuses are met in a practical
manner without inadvertently imposing severe financial hardship on existing borrowers.

Discussion of Comments 



The proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 39631-39635) on September 1, 1992, providing for a 60-day comment period ending November 2, 1992. The
Agency received 25 comments in response to its proposed rulemaking action. A high number of commentors indicated
the rulemaking was not needed because existing regulations were adequate if properly enforced. Some commentors
were supportive of the rulemaking action. Comments were received about the potential abuse of the authority granted
to FmHA field representatives, that the rulemaking action would cause undue delays for approval, impose more work
on existing staff, and possibly warrant requiring fidelity bonds by Agency personnel. Some commentors suggested


alternatives to the proposed rulemaking action, such as requiring all reserve funds be remitted to the Government
for holding under its accounting system until such time as a request is approved for a withdrawal, requiring cosignatories
only for problem accounts, requiring only some reserve funds to be subject to withdrawal, relying on account statements
from financial institutions only, and withholding any authorized return on owners' investment for any year in which
reserve accounts abuses occur. 

The Agency considered the various alternatives and determined the proposed rulemaking action was needed and would
not impose an undue hardship on borrowers. The alternatives suggested did not warrant adoption by the Agency. The
Agency does not deem it wise to require reserves to be remitted to the Government, and also finds such an alternative
to be administratively undesirable, in part because the considerable accounting software modifications needed
would make it cumbersome to implement. Requiring co-signatures only for problem accounts is not attractive because
it does not fully accomplish an Agency objective of ensuring abuses are prevented, rather than relying on punitive
measures. The Agency considers its existing policies to be adequate to impose appropriate punitive measures for
those who are trying to meet program objectives; however, abuses are still occurring and preventive steps are deemed
necessary. Relying on added review of statements from financial institutions does not fully accomplish an Agency
objective of ensuring abuses are prevented, rather than increasingly relying on Agency monitoring to discover and
punish abuses. 

A high number of commentors indicated that it was important that the Agency be required to act timely on requests for
reserve fund withdrawals, especially where emergency repairs are needed. The Agency expects its employees to take
timely action on reserve account withdrawal requests, especially where emergency cases arise. The Agency normally
expects such requests to be acted on within 5 working days of the request (See 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C). However, the
Agency does not agree that this is a valid reason to drop the proposed countersignature provisions. 

Agency regulations have long required prior consent before reserve account funds are used. When circumstances arose
where emergency repairs were needed during non-federal working hours for which no cash was on hand to pay for the repairs,
operators ensured such repairs were made using commonly available business practices. Operators can normally request
the work be billed for payment within 30 days, or that the work be paid via the extension of credit arrangements. Such
work is then able to be repaid at a later date, either through the authorized release of reserve funds for authorized
purposes, or through an alternative revenue source such as project rents. However, the Agency recognized the need
to permit the post approval of commitments made (e.g., work committed under credit arrangements, etc.) in emergency
cases. The Agency modified 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C at paragraph XIII B 2 c (5) as a result of similar comments in a separate
but related rulemaking action to accommodate such treatment. 

A large number of respondents also recommended requiring at least two Agency employees to be authorized to countersign
for reserve account withdrawals to ensure that prompt action can be taken should employees be on travel or leave. Although
the Agency understands it may be desirable to ensure that at least two officials are authorized to countersign for
reserve account withdrawals, it may be impractical to require multiple counter-signatures by authorized Agency
officials in some circumstances. The Agency does not object to accommodating multiple counter-signatures. However,
it does not desire to require multiple signatures, in part, because normal business practices should not demand extremely
prompt action on reserve withdrawal requests even when emergency situations occur. There are ample means of handling
emergencies in a prompt manner other than by relying solely on the immediate access to reserve account funds. Also,
some FmHA offices do not have two qualified employees to authorize reserve fund withdrawals.

The Agency received a number of comments regarding the use of reserve accounts. The information published in the reserve
section was basically the same as published in a separate, but related, prior rulemaking action on 7 CFR part 1930,
subpart C. Changes resulting from that rulemaking action were separately addressed. 

The wording proposed at paragraph XIII B 2 c (2) of Exhibit B of part 1930, subpart C, is being adopted with a modification
of the implementation date. The Agency is modifying the effective date to be 180 days after publication of the final
rule instead of 60 days. This was deemed necessary because of the significant number of commentors who indicated that
establishing accounts requiring countersignature by Agency officials would be cumbersome to implement, especially
if implemented over a short timeframe. The Agency agrees and is providing for a longer implementation period. The
paragraph also provides that reserve funds held just prior to the effective date, in instruments which are subject
to monetary penalties for early withdrawal, may be temporarily held for the time needed to avoid such penalties. 

A comment was received concerning whether borrowers whose accounts were established on or before October 27, 1980,
would be subject to a supervised account for reserve account funds, since these accounts were not subject to the required
account standards set out in FmHA regulations for loans approved after October 27, 1980. The Agency intends all RRH,
RCH, and all LH borrowers operating projects (e.g., all LH borrowers except on-farm type borrowers) to establish
a supervised account for reserve funds. 

Comments received in conjunction with the prior rulemaking changes for 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C, suggested reserve
accounts be permitted to be invested in other than federally insured institutions and readily marketable obligations
of the United States Treasury. The Agency agreed to make some expansion for MFH reserve accounts as prescribed in 7
CFR part 1930, subpart C. Consequently, it is necessary to make a number of technical changes to 7 CFR part 1902, subpart
A to be compatible with these principles. Those changes would have necessitated extensive changes to numerous paragraphs
in the existing regulation. Therefore, the Agency determined the public would be better served to have a separate
section covering all regulations governing the MFH reserve accounts, instead of providing extensive exceptions
in numerous sections of the existing regulation. Section 1902.4 was added to the regulation, taking into consideration
the comments for improvements recommended by the public. 

In addition, a number of recommendations were offered to improve the technical implementation of any regulations
resulting from the prior rulemaking action. Comments indicated that using the term ``bank statements'' when discussing
MFH reserve accounts was not appropriate. The Agency agrees and avoided this wording when used in conjunction with
MFH reserve accounts. 

A commentor also desired clarification as to whether originals or copies of account activity statements are expected.
The Agency will accept either for MFH reserve accounts. A commentor also desired clarification as to when the MFH supervised
account activity statements will be provided to the Agency. The Agency normally will not need account activity statements.
Accordingly, the Agency made changes to clarify this intent. Commentors also were concerned about the need and frequency
of providing MFH reserve account deposit information to the Agency. The Agency normally will not need deposit documentation.
Accordingly, the Agency made changes to clarify this intent. 

It was recommended that proposed rulemaking wording for  1902.1(k) be modified, since it states that the ``Interest-Bearing
Deposit Agreement'' be executed in conjunction with Form FmHA 1940-1. The Agency agrees that the ``Interest-Bearing
Deposit Agreement'' need not be executed when MFH reserve accounts are involved. The Agency avoided referencing
this form when it consolidated all the MFH reserve account provisions in  1902.4. 

A commentor indicated that the proposed revision to  1902.2(a)(6) is not appropriately located, and suggested
adding another paragraph to cover the treatment of MFH accounts at  1902.2(a). The Agency determined that the
proposed clarifying wording is appropriate to ensure it is understood that MFH accounts are to be kept in supervised
accounts as long as the borrower is indebted to the Agency. However, the Agency also agrees that additional coverage
would help convey that MFH reserve funds must be withdrawn for disbursement for an authorized purpose. Consequently,
the Agency consolidated these related provisions into  1902.4.

Also, commentors suggested removing the word ``checking'' where it occurs throughout  1902.14, in part because
credit unions and savings accounts may also be used when MFH reserve accounts are being established. The Agency agrees
and is dropping the word ``checking'' from the section governing MFH reserve funds.

 1902.1 

General. 



This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) for disbursement
of funds under the Loan Disbursement System (LDS), in establishing and using supervised bank accounts, and in placing
Multi-Family Housing (MFH) reserve accounts in supervised bank accounts. The LDS system provides for disbursement
of funds on an as needed basis to substantially reduce interest costs to FmHA borrowers, U.S. Treasury, and FmHA. 



* * * * * 



4. Section 1902.4 is added to read as follows: 



 1902.4 

Establishing MFH reserve accounts in a supervised bank account. 



(a) 

General Requirements. 

All MFH borrowers required to maintain reserve accounts must place the reserve accounts in a supervised bank account(s)
which meets the following requirements: 

(1) 

Countersignature requirements. 

The reserve account must require that any funds withdrawn be countersigned by an authorized FmHA official. 

(2) 

Restrictions on collateral. 

The financial institution holding the reserve account must ensure that the funds are not pledged or taken as security
without the Agency's prior consent. 

(3) 

Interest bearing. 

The reserve account funds are encouraged to be maintained in an interest-bearing account. The ``Interest-Bearing
Deposit Agreement'' set out in Exhibit B of this subpart is not required to be used for reserve accounts. 

(4) 

Restricted investments. 

Reserve funds must be placed in investments authorized in subpart C of part 1930 of this chapter. The authorized investments
are deemed to be of acceptable risk such that the potential for any loss is minimal. 

(5) 

Financial institutions. 

The reserve account must be maintained in authorized financial institutions set out in subpart C of part 1930 of this
chapter (e.g., banks, savings and loan institutions, credit unions, brokerage firms, mutual funds, etc.). Generally,
any financial institution may be used provided invested or deposited funds are insured to protect against theft and
dishonesty. The reserve account funds need not be Federally insured. However, if Federally insured, any amount held
above the Federal insurance ceilings established must be backed by a pledge of collateral from the financial institution,
or otherwise covered by non-federal insurance against theft and dishonesty.

(6) 

Rules where multiple projects are involved. 

A reserve account(s) must be maintained for each borrower. When a borrower owns multiple projects, reserve accounts
may be established for each project. A single reserve account may also be established by a borrower owning multiple
projects, provided the conditions set out in subpart C of part 1930 of this chapter are met. 

(7) 

Term. 

Reserve accounts are expected to be kept for the full term of the loan. 

(b) 

Deposits and account activity statements. 

(1) Deposits. 

Generally, the FmHA will not require the review or approval of deposits or the use of Forms FmHA 402-1 or FmHA 402-2.


(2) 

Account activity statements. 

Generally, the FmHA will not monitor or reconcile the reserve account activity statements issued periodically by
the financial institutions holding the funds. FmHA will monitor reserve account levels through budget reports,
audits, and Agency reserve tracking systems. If disputes arise or the borrower is in violation of Agency regulations,
the Agency may require account activity statements. When account activity statements are sought, it will normally
be sufficient to obtain the statement which reflects balances as of the last activity statement ending period. Form
FmHA 402-2 is not required to be used. 



  1902.17-1902.49 

[Added and reserved]



5. Sections 1902.17 thru 1902.49 are added and reserved.

Reserve account. 

The reserve account is a required account subject to the requirements set out in this paragraph. The borrower will
initiate monthly deposits in this project account, preferably an interest bearing account, starting the same month
the first loan payment is due FmHA. As projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet anticipated
``life-cycle'' needs, including equipment and facility replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution.
All RRH, RCH, and LH borrowers operating projects (i.e., all LH borrowers exclusive of those on-farm type LH borrowers)
are required to establish a reserve account. Effective as of July 26, 1994, reserve funds will be required to be placed
in a supervised account. The provisions of subpart A of part 1902 of this chapter apply. Reserve funds on deposit just

Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital: Multifamily Housing Loans 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule implements section 618(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and
Improvement Act of 1991 (RTCRRIA) and amends the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines to assign a 50 percent risk
weight to loans secured by multifamily residential properties (multifamily housing loans) that meet certain prudential
criteria and to any securities collateralized by such loans. At present, such loans are assigned to the 100 percent
risk weight category. This amendment also satisfies a requirement contained in section 305 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) concerning the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital
guidelines to multifamily housing loans. The final rule also addresses the section 618(b) requirement that the FDIC's
risk-based capital guidelines take into account loss sharing arrangements in connection with sales of multifamily
housing loans. The final rule is intended to facilitate prudent lending for multifamily housing purposes. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On March 14, 1989, the Board of Directors of the FDIC adopted a Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital (12 CFR part
325, appendix A, later redesignated as appendix A to subpart A of part 325) which is applicable to all insured state
nonmember banks supervised by the FDIC (54 FR 11500). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal
Reserve Board (FRB) have also adopted similar risk-based capital standards for the banks under their supervision.
The three agencies based their risk-based capital standards on the report on ``International Convergence of Capital
Measurement and Capital Standards'' (the Basle Accord) issued by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision in July
1988. In addition, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) has implemented risk-based capital rules for savings associations.

Under the FDIC's risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of
its off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories_0, 20, 50, or 100 percent_according
to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. At present, absent qualifying collateral
or guarantees, claims on private sector obligors (other than depository institutions) are generally assigned to
the 100 percent risk weight category under the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the FDIC, the FRB, the OCC,
and the OTS (collectively, the federal banking agencies). Thus, multifamily (five or more dwelling units) housing
loans and privately-issued securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans are normally accorded a 100
percent risk weight by the FDIC.

However, under the Basle Accord, ``loans fully secured by mortgage on residential property which is rented or is (or
is intended to be) occupied by the borrower'' are permitted to be assigned a 50 percent risk weight. Nevertheless,
the Accord admonishes bank supervisory authorities to apply this ``concessionary weight * * * restrictively
and in accordance with strict prudential criteria. This may mean, for example, that in some member countries the 50
per cent. weight * * * will only be applied where strict, legally-based, valuation rules ensure a substantial
margin of additional security over the amount of the loan.'' To date, the 50 percent risk weight has been accorded only
to loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties that meet certain prudential criteria. 


Section 618(b)(1) of the RTCRRIA requires the federal banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital guidelines
to assign multifamily housing loans that meet certain criteria and any security collateralized by such loans to the
50 percent risk weight category. In order for a multifamily housing loan to qualify for this preferential capital
treatment, the loan must be secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property, the loan-to-value ratio
for the property must not exceed 80 percent (75 percent if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the
loan), the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before debt service) to annual debt service
on the loan must not be less than 120 percent (115 percent if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the
loan), the amortization period for principal and interest on the loan must not exceed 30 years, the loan must have a
minimum maturity for principal repayment of not less than seven years, and the loan must have had timely payment of
principal and interest in accordance with the loan terms for at least one year. Section 618(b)(1) further provides
that a multifamily housing loan must meet ``any other underwriting characteristics that the appropriate Federal
banking agency may establish, consistent with the purposes of the minimum acceptable capital requirements to maintain
the safety and soundness of financial institutions.'' 


In addition, section 305 of the FDICIA (Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2355 (12 U.S.C. 1828 note)) in part requires
the federal banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital standards for insured depository institutions to
ensure that those standards ``reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multifamily mortgages.''



Section 618(b)(2) of the RTCRRIA requires the FDIC to amend its risk-based capital standards: 




To provide that any loan fully secured by a first lien on a multifamily housing property that is sold subject to a pro
rata loss sharing arrangement 
* * * shall be treated as sold to the extent that loss is incurred by the purchaser of the loan. 





This section then defines the term ``pro rata loss sharing arrangement'' as ``an agreement providing that the purchaser
of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on a pro rata basis.'' 


Section 618(b)(3) of the RTCRRIA then directs the FDIC to amend its risk-based capital framework ``to take into account
other loss sharing arrangements in connection with the sale'' of multifamily housing loans ``for purposes of determining
the extent to which such loans shall be treated as sold.'' An ``other loss sharing arrangement'' is then defined as
``an agreement providing that the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution
on other than a pro rata basis.'' 




II. Description of Proposed Rule 




On April 1, 1992, the FDIC published a proposed rule designed to implement the provisions of section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA
(57 FR 11010). The preamble to the proposed rule further noted that implementation of the proposal would also satisfy
the provision of section 305 of the FDICIA concerning the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines
to multifamily housing loans. 




Criteria for Multifamily Housing Loans and Securities 




In order to achieve the safety and soundness objective set forth in section 618(b)(1), the proposal observed that
it is imperative that appropriate criteria be established to distinguish between multifamily housing loans that
are accorded a 100 percent risk weight and those that are of sufficiently high quality to warrant a more favorable 50
percent risk weight. In this regard, the proposal noted that data reported in the Consolidated Reports of Condition
and Income filed by all FDIC-insured commercial banks revealed that net charge-offs of multifamily housing loans
by such banks for calendar year 1991 were 2.01 percent of multifamily housing loans outstanding. The percentage of
multifamily housing loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1991, for all
FDIC-insured commercial banks was 5.64 percent of multifamily housing loans outstanding. In contrast, for single
family housing loans, which the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines assign to the 50 percent risk weight category
if they meet certain criteria, the net charge-off rate for calendar year 1991 was only 0.20 percent of loans outstanding.
Single family housing loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1991, for all
FDIC-insured commercial banks were 1.65 percent.

Thus, the FDIC's proposed rule lowering the risk weight for certain multifamily housing loans incorporated the specific
statutory criteria described in section I. above and also included four additional safety and soundness criteria
that multifamily housing loans would have to meet in order to receive a reduced risk weight. These four criteria, which
were developed by the FDIC after consulting with the other federal banking agencies, provided that: (1) The loan-to-value
ratio used to determine the eligibility of a multifamily housing loan for the lower risk weight would be the ratio at
the time the loan was originated; (2) the loan must not be more than 90 days past due or carried in nonaccrual status;
(3) the average annual occupancy rate of the property securing the loan must have been at least 80 percent for at least
one year; and (4) the loan must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards. Taken together,
the statutory and proposed additional criteria were intended to ensure that only those multifamily housing loans
whose future repayment prospects are such that they expose an institution to relatively low levels of credit risk
would receive the more favorable 50 percent risk weight. These criteria were also intended to ensure that such loans
have risk characteristics that are consistent with the Basle Accord's provisions regarding the assignment of a preferential
risk weight. 

As for securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans, the FDIC observed in the preamble to the proposed
rule that its risk-based capital guidelines presently accord a 50 percent risk weight to privately-issued mortgage-backed
securities that are ``backed by a pool of conventional mortgages,'' each of which meets the criteria ``for inclusion
in the 50 percent risk weight category at the time the pool is originated.'' Such securities must also meet a number
of safety and soundness criteria that are specified in the guidelines. Therefore, by operation of the existing language
on privately-issued mortgage-backed securities in the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines, the proposal stated
that the explicit addition of multifamily housing loans to the 50 percent risk weight category would have the effect
of lowering to 50 percent the risk weight for privately-issued mortgage-backed securities collateralized by such
loans, provided the multifamily housing loans that back these securities qualify for a 50 percent risk weight at the
time the securities are originated.







Loss Sharing Arrangements 



The FDIC's existing risk-based capital guidelines do not specifically address how asset sales involving various
forms of loss sharing arrangements are to be handled by a selling bank. This is because, for purposes of applying the
risk-based capital standards, a bank's balance sheet assets are determined in accordance with the instructions
for the preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report). Thus, the instructions for
preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income are the source for guidance on determining the extent
to which assets such as multifamily housing loans are treated as sold when there is a loss sharing arrangement covering
the assets. The proposed rule therefore sought to implement the section 618(b) requirement that the FDIC's risk-based
capital guidelines take into account loss sharing arrangements on sales of multifamily housing loans by referencing
the relevant Call Report instructions. 

With respect to sales subject to pro rata loss sharing arrangements, the Call Report instructions direct banks to
report these transactions in a manner that is consistent with the language of section 618(b)(2) quoted in section
I above. These instructions state that:




If the risk retained by the seller is limited to some fixed percentage of any losses that might be incurred and there
are no other provisions resulting in retention of risk, either directly or indirectly, by the seller, the maximum
amount of possible loss for which the selling bank is at risk (the stated percentage times the sale proceeds) shall
be reported as a borrowing and the remaining amount of the assets transferred reported as a sale.




Thus, the FDIC proposed to amend its risk-based capital guidelines to provide in a footnote an explanation of this
treatment for sellers of multifamily housing loans subject to pro rata loss sharing arrangements. 

For Call Report purposes, in general, other transfers of multifamily housing loans are to be reported as sales of the
transferred assets only if the selling institution ``(1) retains no risk of loss from the assets transferred resulting
from any cause and (2) has no obligation to any party for the payment of principal or interest on the assets transferred''
resulting from any cause. The FDIC's risk-based capital framework has taken other loss sharing arrangements into
account in this manner when determining the extent to which assets such as multifamily housing loans are treated as
sold and excluded from the balance sheet assets that must be risk weighted. In order to implement section 618(b)(3),
the FDIC proposed to amend its risk-based capital guidelines to explicitly disclose this treatment of other loss
sharing arrangements in a footnote.

III. Comment Summary 



The FDIC received 21 comment letters addressing various aspects of its proposed rule. Letters were submitted by 12
depository institutions or holding companies, four trade associations representing depository institutions,
three trade associations representing housing and home building interests, and one secondary mortgage market maker.
One comment document was filed by a group of individuals. 

Of the 21 letters received, six respondents agreed with the proposal to lower the risk weight for multifamily housing
loans and offered no suggestions for changes to it. Another 12 commenters generally found the FDIC's proposal acceptable,
but recommended certain changes in the eligibility criteria or the treatment of loss sharing arrangements. Three
respondents objected to the proposal to lower the risk weight for multifamily housing loans, although two of these
commenters made suggestions for improving the eligibility criteria. Three commenters, two of whom supported the
proposal and one who opposed it, expressed concern that Congress had mandated that the regulatory agencies lower
the risk weight for a specific loan category. 



Loan-to-Value Ratios 



Although the proposal called for the loan-to-value ratio requirement to be met at the origination of a multifamily
housing loan, the FDIC specifically requested comment on whether, in light of the other criteria that a multifamily
housing loan must also meet, (1) a loan that does not satisfy the loan-to-value ratio requirement at origination should
be permitted to do so later during the life of the loan and, if so, under what circumstances, and (2) a loan that satisfies
this requirement at origination but fails to do so at a later date should thereafter be ineligible for a 50 percent risk
weight. 

These issues were addressed by five respondents. Two respondents suggested that the loan-to-value ratios of ``large''
multifamily properties be recalculated every two years to determine whether the required ratio continues to be met.
The other three respondents stated that multifamily housing loans not meeting the loan-to-value ratio requirement
at origination should be eligible for the 50 percent risk weight if the ratio later decreases as a result of either principal
payments or increased property values. However, only one of these three also recommended that multifamily housing
loans should have their risk weights increased from 50 to 100 percent if their loan-to-value ratios rise above the
levels set forth in the proposal subsequent to their origination. In contrast, another of these three commenters
stated that a multifamily housing loan whose loan-to-value ratio increases after origination should be eligible
to retain its 50 percent risk weight as long as the remaining eligibility criteria continued to be met. Finally, one
of these commenters expressed concern about the cost of obtaining appraisals if the final rule were to require frequent
reappraisals to ensure that the loan-to-value ratio requirement continues to be satisfied over time. 

After considering these comments and consulting with the other agencies, the FDIC has decided that the loan-to-value
ratio requirement in the final rule should not be a one-time only test at origination. Rather, a multifamily housing
loan that does not satisfy the loan-to-value ratio requirement at origination, but does so at a later date, should
then receive the benefit of a more favorable risk weight (assuming the other eligibility criteria are also met). A
multifamily housing loan whose loan-to-value ratio no longer meets the specified ratio requirement has a reduced
margin of collateral protection and its relative risk has increased to a level that no longer justifies the loan's
continued eligibility for a 50 percent risk weight. 

Thus, the final rule makes the loan-to-value ratio requirement an ongoing eligibility criterion by stating that
the ratio should be determined on the basis of the most current appraisal or evaluation of the property, whichever
may be appropriate.
 This approach is also intended to be consistent with the FDIC's regulations and guidelines for real estate lending
and appraisals. Under these regulations and guidelines, a bank's written real estate lending policies must establish
prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits. In addition, a bank's real estate appraisal and
evaluation programs should include general criteria that identify when it is in the bank's interests to reappraise
or reevaluate real estate collateral. Thus, the final rule does not mandate a specific frequency with which reappraisals
and reevaluations of multifamily properties must be made, but relies instead on a bank's own policies and procedures
in this area.

<TEXT>
 

The specific loan-to-value ratios required by the proposed rule, i.e., 80 percent for fixed rate loans and 75 percent
for adjustable rate loans, were addressed by two commenters. Each suggested that the same ratio should apply regardless
of whether a loan has a fixed or adjustable rate. However, one of these commenters preferred using an 80 percent ratio
for all multifamily housing loans while the other preferred a 75 percent ratio. The final rule retains the separate
ratios for fixed and adjustable rate loans that were contained in the proposal. These ratios are taken directly from
the statute.

In addition, two commenters indicated that multifamily housing loans that do not meet the loan-to-value ratio requirement
but have additional collateral or credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance should be eligible for the 50 percent
risk weight. The FDIC's risk-based capital standards formally recognize only certain forms of collateral and guarantees
for purposes of risk-weighting assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items. The FDIC does not
believe it would be appropriate to recognize additional forms of collateral and guarantees solely for multifamily
housing loans.



Annual Occupancy Rate



Comments were received from three respondents on the proposed requirement, not mandated by the statute, that the
average annual occupancy rate of the property securing the loan must have been at least 80 percent for at least one year.
These commenters pointed out that the ongoing loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage ratio requirements
set forth in the statute should be sufficient to ensure that only high quality multifamily housing loans would qualify
for the 50 percent risk weight. It was also indicated that information on occupancy rates is not regularly being obtained
as part of the financial data that borrowers supply on the properties securing multifamily housing loans. Thus, the
inclusion of an occupancy rate requirement in the final rule would impose an additional burden on both borrowers and
lenders. The FDIC agrees with these commenters and has eliminated the proposed occupancy rate requirement from the
final rule.



Properties Owned by Cooperatives and Nonprofit Organizations



Four commenters questioned the applicability of the eligibility criteria to properties owned by cooperative housing
corporations and nonprofit organizations. In particular, the ``operating income'' concept included in the debt
service coverage requirement was considered inappropriate because these types of properties, since they are not
owned by investors seeking a return on their investments, are not operated to produce income. Accordingly, these
commenters suggested that, for multifamily properties with a nonprofit form of ownership, a more flexible approach
to meeting the debt service coverage ratio requirements set forth in the statute would be justified. The FDIC recognizes
that the cash flow to service a loan secured by a multifamily property can come from ``operating income'' as well as
from other sources. Therefore, the debt service coverage criterion in the final rule indicates that properties owned
by cooperative housing corporations or nonprofit organizations must generate sufficient cash flow to provide protection
to the bank comparable to that afforded by the debt service coverage levels set forth in the statute that are based on
annual net operating income.



Repayment Performance



Two commenters stated that the FDIC's proposal to add a requirement that a multifamily housing loan must not be more
than 90 days past due or carried in nonaccrual status in order to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight was unnecessary
because of the statutory requirement that all principal and interest payments be made on a timely basis in accordance
with the terms of the loan for at least one year. One of these commenters indicated that a loan on which timely payments
have been made for at least one year ``will not be more than 90 days past due and is unlikely to be in nonaccrual status''
while the other suggested that the loan would be ``in reasonably good shape, even it is technically ninety (90) days
past due.''

<TEXT>
 

Although it may not have been clear from the proposal, the requirement that a loan not be 90 days or more past due or in
nonaccrual status was intended to be an ongoing test that would have to be met at the time a multifamily housing loan
was placed in the 50 percent risk weight category and thereafter. The FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines currently
contain the same ongoing requirement for one-to-four family residential mortgages to qualify for the 50 percent
risk weight. In contrast, the statutory requirement that timely contractual principal and interest payments must
have occurred for at least one year before a multifamily housing loan can qualify for a 50 percent risk weight is a one-time
requirement. To eliminate confusion, the final rule separately lists these two eligibility criteria and clarifies
that timely payments must have been made for at least one year before a multifamily housing loan is placed in the 50 percent
risk weight category.



Prudent Underwriting Standards



The proposal's final eligibility criterion required the multifamily housing loan to have been made ``in accordance
with applicable lending limits and other prudent underwriting standards.'' Two commenters asked what was meant
by ``prudent underwriting standards.'' Guidance for prudent real estate loan underwriting standards is outlined
in appendix A to part 365 of the FDIC's rules and regulations, ``Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies''
(12 CFR part 365, appendix A), which was adopted by the FDIC in October 1992 (57 FR 62896, December 31, 1992).

A third commenter suggested that this criterion was unnecessary and that it should go without saying that a bank should
comply with applicable lending limits. This commenter also questioned why lending limits were singled out in this
criterion when compliance with many other statutory and regulatory requirements is expected during the underwriting
of a loan. The FDIC has deleted the specific reference to lending limits in the final rule.



Optional Nature of Lower Risk Weight



One commenter who supported the proposal nonetheless requested that the FDIC ensure that banks are aware that, under
the final rule, they have the option of assigning multifamily housing loans that meet the criteria specified in the
rule to the 50 percent risk weight or continuing to treat such loans as 100 percent risk weight assets. One of the commenters
who opposed the proposal did so because the cost associated with substantiating that a multifamily housing loan was
eligible to be placed in the 50 percent risk weight category would exceed the benefit of the lower risk weight.

<DOCNO> FR940127-0-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The FDIC has no intention of imposing this cost on banks that would prefer not to incur it. Thus, the FDIC wishes to reiterate
that, at each bank's option, assets, including multifamily housing loans, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance
sheet items that are eligible to be assigned to a risk weight category lower than 100 percent may be included in a higher
risk weight category (e.g., the 100 percent risk weight category) than the category to which the assets or credit equivalent
amounts are otherwise eligible to be assigned. 



Loss Sharing Arrangements 




Comment letters from two respondents addressed the treatment of loss sharing arrangements in connection with the
sale of multifamily housing loans that was contained in the proposed rule. Both commenters agreed with the proposal's
approach for handling a pro rata loss sharing arrangement (i.e., for the selling bank to treat the transfer as a sale
to the extent that the purchaser shares with the seller on pro rata basis in any loss incurred), but took exception to
the proposed treatment of other loss sharing arrangements. Under the proposal, other loss sharing arrangements
were to be taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which multifamily housing loans are treated
by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the
same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the Call Report instructions. Hence, multifamily housing loans
sold subject to loss sharing arrangements on other than a pro rata basis would treat such loans as sold for risk-based
capital purposes only if the selling bank retains no risk of loss from the loans transferred resulting from any cause
and has no obligation to any party for the payment of principal or interest on the loans transferred resulting from
any cause. 


One commenter indicated that, in lieu of the proposed treatment for other loss sharing arrangements, the selling
institution ``should retain capital in proportion to the risk retained but not for the whole loan.'' The other commenter
who addressed loss sharing arrangements stated that the proposed treatment of other loss sharing arrangements does
not ``provide an accurate measure of risk exposure or appropriately tailored incentives,'' ``may discourage lenders
from limiting their recourse obligation,'' and is ``inconsistent with the statutory requirement.'' This commenter
recommended that the FDIC ``adopt rules that distinguish different loss risks for non-pro rata arrangements, rather
than the existing rule in the Call Reports'' and offered suggested approaches for doing so. This commenter also acknowledged
that the regulatory capital treatment of asset sales subject to loss sharing arrangements is an issue that goes beyond
multifamily housing loans and requires a comprehensive solution.

The FDIC recognizes that the proposed rule on other loss sharing arrangements essentially treats all such arrangements
in an identical manner regardless of the terms of the arrangement and, as a consequence, may not encourage banks that
sell multifamily housing loans with recourse to limit their exposure to risk. However, these concerns extend to asset
sales with recourse in general because of the broad scope of the Call Report instructions in this area and their relationship
to the risk-based capital framework. The FDIC and the other banking agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council, have been pursuing a more comprehensive resolution of the capital issues surrounding
asset sales with recourse and other forms of credit enhancement. This interagency effort is seeking to develop revisions
to the agencies' risk-based capital standards that will better distinguish between the degrees of risk in loss sharing
arrangements involving asset sales in general, not just those involving multifamily housing loans. The FDIC expects
that these revisions would be more likely to fully satisfy the intent of section 618(b)(3) with respect to other loss
sharing arrangements than the approach taken in the proposed rule. Nevertheless, the FDIC does not wish to further
delay the issuance of a final rule that lowers the risk weight for certain multifamily housing loans and provides guidance
on the risk-based capital treatment of pro rata loss sharing arrangements while the interagency effort to address
recourse issues is proceeding. Therefore, as an interim measure, the FDIC is adopting the treatment of other loss
sharing arrangements as originally proposed. 



Other Issues 



Several commenters suggested changes to the proposed rule that would conflict with the requirements set forth in
the statute. These suggestions included a lower debt service coverage ratio requirement, a shorter minimum maturity
requirement, and a 75 percent rather than 50 percent risk weight for multifamily housing loans. These suggestions
have not been adopted. 




IV. Final Rule 




After considering the comments received and consulting with the other agencies, the FDIC is adopting a final rule
to implement section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA. The final rule will also satisfy that portion of section 305 of the FDICIA
relating to the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines to multifamily housing loans. 


The final rule adds a new paragraph on multifamily housing loans to the discussion of the types of assets accorded a
50 percent risk weight in the section of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines on risk weights for balance sheet
assets (section II.C.). The new paragraph enumerates the criteria that a multifamily housing loan must satisfy in
order to be eligible for this favorable risk weight. A conforming change has been made to the summary of risk weights
and risk categories in table II of the guidelines. 


The eligibility criteria contained in the final rule include those set forth in section 618(b) and two added by the
FDIC based on the authority granted in the statute. These criteria are that the loan must be secured by a first lien on
a multifamily residential property, the loan-to-value ratio for the property must not exceed 80 percent (75 percent
if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the loan), the ratio of annual net operating income generated
by the property (before debt service) to annual debt service on the loan must not be less than 120 percent (115 percent
if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the loan), the amortization period for principal and interest
on the loan must not exceed 30 years, the loan must have a minimum original maturity for principal repayment of not less
than seven years, the loan must have had timely payment of principal and interest in accordance with the loan terms
for at least one year before the loan is placed in the 50 percent risk weight category, the loan must not be 90 days or more
past due or carried in nonaccrual status, and the loan must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting
standards. 


For purposes of satisfying the one year's timely repayment performance criterion in the case where the existing owner
of a multifamily residential property refinances a loan on that property, the final rule provides that all principal
and interest payments on the loan being refinanced must have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms
of the loan for at least the preceding year. In this situation, all of the other eligibility criteria must also be met
in order for the new loan to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. For example, the annual debt service required on
the new loan would be used when determining whether the debt service coverage requirement has been satisfied. 


Under the final rule, the loan-to-value ratio requirement must be met based on the most current appraisal or evaluation
of the property, whichever may be appropriate, and, at the origination of loans to purchase an existing property,
the term ``value'' means the lesser of the actual acquisition cost or the estimate of value for the property. In addition,
the final rule explains that, to satisfy the debt service coverage requirement, a property owned by a cooperative
housing corporation or nonprofit organization must generate sufficient cash flow to provide protection to the bank
comparable to that specified in the statute.

<DOCNO> FR940127-0-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The final rule also revises the existing paragraph addressing privately-issued mortgage-backed securities in
the discussion of the types of assets assigned to the 50 percent risk weight category. The amendment clarifies that
in order for a security backed by a pool of conventional mortgages on multifamily residential properties to be accorded
a 50 percent risk weight, each underlying mortgage must meet the eligibility criteria described above at the time
the pool is originated. A bank that purchases such a security will not be required to monitor the eligibility of each
underlying mortgage on an ongoing basis to ensure that a 50 percent risk weight remains appropriate for the security.
Instead, the security may remain in the 50 percent risk weight category as long as principal or interest payments on
the security are not 30 days or more past due. 

Finally, the final rule amends the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines by stating in a footnote that a multifamily
housing loan that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement is to be treated by the selling bank as sold (and
excluded from balance sheet assets) to the extent that the sales agreement provides for the purchaser of the loan to
share in any loss incurred on the loan on a pro rata basis with the selling bank. This means that, in such a transaction,
the portion of the loan that is treated as sold by the selling bank is not subject to the risk-based capital standards.
This footnote also provides explicit guidance on the risk-based capital treatment of sales of multifamily housing
loans in which the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than
a pro rata basis. It states that these other loss sharing arrangements are taken into account for purposes of determining
the extent to which such loans are treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under
the risk-based capital framework in the same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the instructions for
preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. 
The instructions applicable to such transactions are contained in the Glossary entry for ``sales of assets.'' 

This final rule is effective January 27, 1994. The FDIC has determined that good cause exists to waive the customary
30-day delayed effective date since the rule relieves a restriction on insured state nonmember banks by permitting
them to utilize a lower risk weight for eligible multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such
loans in calculations of their risk-based capital ratios. In addition, insured state nonmember banks may choose
to utilize this lower risk weight in their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for December 31, 1993. 



V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



The FDIC certifies that the adoption of this amendment to its risk-based capital guidelines will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

). Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. 

The amendment will benefit insured state nonmember banks by reducing the minimum amount of capital that they are required
to maintain for certain multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such loans. The proposal would
apply equally to all insured state nonmember banks, regardless of size, and should not disproportionately affect
a substantial number of small banks.

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts a final rule amending
its regulations to allow Farm Credit System (FCS) institutions to document the existence of a first lien on the security
for long-term real estate mortgage loans by obtaining title insurance or an attorney's certification. The current
regulation requires that an attorney's certification be obtained for every long-term mortgage loan in order for
that loan to qualify as collateral for FCS debt obligations. The regulation is being amended because title insurance
has become the prevailing method used by the mortgage lending industry to ensure clear title. Additionally, the revised
regulation permits FCS institutions greater flexibility in determining which method for validating first lien
position (an attorney's certification or title insurance) provides the institution the most cost-effective and
efficient protection. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 1.10(a)(2) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (Act), requires that long-term mortgage loans made by
Farm Credit Banks (FCBs) under section 1.7 of the Act, or by associations under sections 1.7 and 7.6 of the Act, ``be
secured by first liens on interests in real estate of such classes as may be prescribed by regulations of the Farm Credit
Administration.'' At present,  615.5060 requires that an attorney's certification be obtained for long-term
mortgage loans if such loans are to qualify as collateral for FCS debt obligations. However, title insurance is the
prevailing method for ensuring clear title in the mortgage lending industry and is becoming more commonplace in FCS
lending. Title insurance can provide a lender with protection that is comparable to an attorney's certification
and in some instances may be more timely and less expensive to obtain. Under the present  615.5060, even if FCS
lenders obtain title insurance they must also obtain an attorney's certification, thus incurring unnecessary expense
without providing any substantial additional protection. FCA reconsidered this requirement, and published a proposed
rule on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52701) to amend the regulation to permit institutions to obtain title insurance instead
of an attorney's certificate to document the existence of a first lien, provided that the title insurance policy meets
certain standards. 

The FCA recognizes that practices within the mortgage lending industry continually change and is amending 
 615.5060 to give FCS institutions additional flexibility while maintaining protection for them as well as
for FCS investors and borrower-stockholders. The revised regulation allows FCS institutions to determine which
method for validating first lien position (an attorney's certification or title insurance) provides them the best
protection for the amount expended. 



II. Synopsis of Comments 



The comment period for the proposed amendments to 
 615.5060 closed November 12, 1993. FCA received four comment letters during the public comment period from:
The Farm Credit Council (FCC), a Farm Credit Bank (FCB), an agricultural credit association (ACA), and a Texas law
firm. In addition, an FCB and a Federal land credit association (FLCA) commented on this regulation as part of their
responses to the FCA Board's Statement on Regulatory Burden, which appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003), seeking public comment on the appropriateness of regulatory requirements imposed
on the FCS. 

All commenters strongly supported the amendments to the proposed regulation. In general, commenters believe that
the revision would provide additional flexibility and allow FCS institutions to evaluate present practices and
determine the best course of action. Further, commenters indicated that since many FCS institutions already require
title insurance on real estate loans the proposed regulation would greatly simplify the closing process and reduce
costs. One commenter stated that the FCA's existing requirement for long-term real estate loans is both antiquated
and unduly burdensome, and it therefore fully endorsed the intent of FCA's proposed regulations.

In addition to general comments, the FCC and the ACA offered technical suggestions that they believe would improve
or clarify the regulation. Commenters were concerned that the words ``at loan closing'' in proposed 
 615.5060(a)(2) created some ambiguity because it is often not possible to obtain a title insurance policy
at the time of loan closing. One commenter stated that a loan is closed based on a title commitment and a final title insurance
policy is not issued until after loan closing when there is satisfaction of the requirements set out in the commitment.
Another commenter stated that it is a common practice to obtain the actual title policy at a later date, with the policy
being issued ``as of'' the date the lien documents are recorded. Commenters asserted that FCS institutions would
be unable to take advantage of the additional flexibility and cost savings the proposed regulation is intended to
provide if the institutions were required to obtain a final title insurance policy at loan closing. FCA modified proposed
 615.5060(a)(2) by deleting the requirement that the policy be obtained ``at loan closing'' but notes that
the Act authorizes an FCB to make a long-term mortgage loan only if that loan is secured by a first lien on real estate.


The FCC and the ACA also commented that, as currently written, proposed  615.5060(a)(2)(ii) might be construed
to mean that counsel must approve not only the standard form to be used, but also the way in which the form is completed
in each particular case. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) requires only that the final title policy be issued on a standard title
insurance policy form that the counsel for the lending institution has approved. The language in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)
was revised to make this clearer. Further, the FCC and the ACA suggested that, because many ACAs and FLCAs do not have
their own in-house counsel, the regulation should be modified to allow counsel for either the association or the ``supervising''
bank to approve the standard form. The phrase ``counsel for the lending institution'' in  615.5060 (a)(2)(ii)
and (a)(2)(iv) is not meant to require that an association have in-house counsel. An association may, if it wishes,
rely on counsel for the affiliated bank or the association's retained counsel if counsel agrees to act for the association
in approving the form of the title insurance policy and prescribing these standards. 

Proposed  615.5060(a)(2)(iii) requires that the title insurance policy be issued ``for an amount equal to
the balance outstanding on the real estate mortgage loan.'' Commenters stated that multiple tracts of real estate
are frequently offered as security for a loan and in some situations separate title insurance policies for various
tracts are obtained from different insurers. The FCC further stated that title insurance companies often require
that the insured amount be allocated among the various policies, and often refuse to issue a policy in an amount in excess
of the value of the particular tract they are insuring. The FCC further stated that the amount of the title insurance
that should be required should be directly related to the value of the lender's interest in the property that is being
insured. Therefore, the FCC suggested that  615.5060(a)(2)(iii) be revised to require that the final policy
be issued for an amount equal to the balance outstanding on the real estate mortgage loan ``or such lesser amount as
is sufficient to protect the interest of the lending institution in the insured property.'' The FCC believes that
such language would enable the lending institution to determine whether the title policy should be issued for the
full amount of the loan or, when multiple tracts are taken as security, for the market or appraised value of the property
being insured, whether that value is greater than or less than the amount of the loan. 

The FCA Board conceptually agrees with the commenters that the title insurance should be issued for an amount that
is sufficient to protect the interest of the lending institution. However, the FCA Board believes that the amount
of title insurance necessary to protect the lender on a long-term real estate mortgage loan is no less than the outstanding
loan balance. The Act and FCA regulations limit long-term real estate loans to a percentage of the appraised value
of the real estate security. FCA's regulation does not require that an institution obtain title insurance for an amount
that is in excess of the value of the real estate security, but rather requires coverage in an amount at least equal to
the outstanding loan balance, an amount less than the value of the real estate security. In the case of multiple tracts,
if a separate policy is issued for a tract, the minimum amount insured by that policy shall bear the same ratio to the
outstanding balance that the appraised value of the tract bears to the appraised value of all the real estate security.
Accordingly, the final rule requires that if only title insurance is used to document the existence of a first lien,
the final title policy or policies must be issued for an amount at least equal to the outstanding loan balance.

Commenters also indicated that in loans with multiple tracts, title to some tracts may be evidenced by abstracts while
other tracts are covered by title insurance. This comment indirectly raises the issue of whether the regulation permits
the lender to decide, for each tract, whether to use an attorney lien certification or title insurance to document
the existence of a first lien when more than one tract is involved in a single first mortgage loan. The regulation should
not be read to preclude the use of different methods of lien documentation for different tracts. In the case of multiple
tracts, if title insurance is relied upon for some tracts and attorney certifications are used for others, the minimum
amount insured by a policy for a particular tract shall bear the same ratio to the outstanding balance that the appraised
value of the tract bears to the appraised value of all the real estate security. For example, suppose a loan for $80,000
is secured by two properties with appraised values of $70,000 and $30,000. Insurance policies for the properties
should be obtained in amounts of at least $56,000 and $24,000, respectively. If an attorney lien certification is
used for the first property, then title insurance for the second property need only be obtained for $24,000_not the
$80,000 loan amount. 

Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(iv) requires that personnel with adequate training and experience in real estate title
matters, designated by counsel, certify in writing that they reviewed the final policy and that the final policy insures
a first lien or its equivalent on the primary real estate security for the loan. Commenters believe that it should suffice
that a person performing this function meet certain standards of training and experience that are prescribed by the
counsel for the lender, but that there should be no specific requirement that counsel actually designate the individual
who performs this function. The FCA agrees with the commenters' observations and has modified paragraph (a)(2)(iv)
to require that a person performing this function meet written standards for training and experience prescribed
by the counsel for the lender, and to eliminate any implication that counsel actually has to designate the individual
who performs this function. 

Finally, the first sentence of  615.5060(a) is revised to make it less awkward. The meaning of the sentence is
not changed.

ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego
``PZL-RZESZOW'' PZL-3S Second Series engines, that currently requires removal from service of certain
modified pistons, inspection of the propeller to engine propeller-flange attachment bolts, inspection of the engine
propeller-flange retaining nut, and inspection of the rear crankshaft counterweight system. This amendment removes
the repetitive inspection requirements of the existing AD, but retains the requirement to remove from service certain
modified pistons. This amendment is prompted by test results that have indicated that PZL-3S Second Series
engines not configured with modified pistons are not susceptible to excessive vibration. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent separation of the propeller and loss of the aircraft.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 91-18-12, Amendment
39-8120 (57 FR 5378, February 14, 1992), which is applicable to Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego ``PZL-RZESZOW''
PZL-3S Second Series engines, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 5, 1993 (58 FR 278). That action proposed to remove the repetitive inspection requirements of the existing
AD, but retain the requirements for removal from service of certain pistons that have been modified and assembled
with certain compression ring, scraper ring, and oil control ring components. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
There are approximately 11 PZL-3S Second Series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 3 engines of the affected design are installed on aircraft of U.S. registry, that it will take approximately
5 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

action:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This action establishes Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia. A VHF Omni-Directional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment
(VOR/DME-A) Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Cook County Airport has been developed
and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed to contain instrument

History


On August 25, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia, to accommodate a VOR/DME-A instrument approach procedure to the Cook County
Airport, Adel, Georgia (58 FR 47411). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above
the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while
transiting between the en route and terminal environments, and to change the operating status of the airport from
visual flight rules (VFR) operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area'' and has replaced it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' for airspace extending upward from 700 feet above
the surface. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designation for Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1
(58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia, to accommodate
a VOR/DME-A SIAP based on the Moultrie VOR to the Cook County Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward
from 700 feet above the surface is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach.
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable VFR requirements.
In addition, the operating status of the Cook County Airport is changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations
concurrent with the publication of the SIAP.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above. 



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers or aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.


This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days. 

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the US Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and
safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable,
and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective
in less than 30 days.

Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the
anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.












</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

North Carolina; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions contained in rules promulgated
between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster I. These requirements are listed in Section
B of this document. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed North Carolina's application(s) and
has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the North Carolina hazardous waste program revisions
satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North
Carolina's hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's applications for program revisions are available
for public review and comment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 



States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows
States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated
under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements
under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.


Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270. 



B. North Carolina 



North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984,
(49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final 
authorization effective February 16, 1993, for Non-HSWA Cluster VI and HSWA Cluster II (54 FR 59825, December 16,
1992). On September 21, 1992, North Carolina submitted program revision application for additional program approvals.
On October 20, 1993, North Carolina submitted an addendium to the September 21, 1992, program revision application.
Today, North Carolina is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 

EPA has reviewed North Carolina's applications and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Carolina. The public
may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 28, 1994. 

Copies of North Carolina's application(s) for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying
at the locations indicated in the 

Addresses

 section of this document.

<TEXT>
 

Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective March 28, 1994, unless an adverse comment
pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 

If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a
notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision. 

EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon
the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior
to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions
for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. 

North Carolina is today seeking authority to administer the following federal requirements promulgated between
July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991, for the requirements of RCRA Cluster I except for the February 21, 1991, (56 FR 7134)








C. Decision 



I conclude that North Carolina's application(s) for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory
requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous
waste program as revised.

North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application
and previously approved authorities. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although
EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections
3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 

This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

was needed to clarify the rules. It will eliminate procedures that are unnecessary and duplicative of functions performed
by the Commission license processing staff.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Order



Adopted: January 3, 1994.

Released: January 11, 1994.




By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:

1. Section 13.205 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.205, currently provides that a commercial operator license
examination (COLE) manager must give examination credit to an examinee holding certain documents.
 This procedure is unnecessary and duplicative of a function performed by the Commission license processing staff.
We are amending  13.205, therefore, to clarify that the Commission rather than the COLE manager will grant examination
credit when appropriate, and   13.9(c) and 13.13(c) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.9(c) and 13.13(c),
to clarify that applicants who desire examination credit must submit documentation supporting their request.





2. We also are moving the showing required of an applicant to qualify for a radiotelegraph Six Months Service Endorsement
from  13.201(c) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.201(c), to  13.9(d) of the Commission's Rules, 47
CFR 13.9(d). This change is intended to clarify that qualification for the Six Month Service Endorsement is determined
directly by the Commission rather than the COLE Manager.

3. Because the rule amendments adopted herein are nonsubstantive in nature, the notice and comment provisions of
section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, therefore, need not be complied with. Authority for
this action is contained in  0.331(a)(1) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 0.331(a)(1).

4. Accordingly, part 13 is amended, effective February 24, 1994, as set forth below.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule amends and extends Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 36, which provides that authorized
repair station and aircraft operating certificate holders may approve aircraft products or articles for return
to service after accomplishing major repairs using self-developed repair data that have not been approved by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Amendments include clarification of the scope of the SFAR authorization.
Extension of the regulation continues to provide, for those that qualify, an alternative from the requirement to
obtain FAA approval of major repair data on a case-by-case basis, and allows additional time for the FAA to incorporate
the SFAR provisions into the regulations.

Supplementary Information:
Background


Notice No. 93-15, Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36, Development of Major Repair Data, was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on Thursday, October 21, 1993; the comment period closed on November 22, 1993. Ten comments were received and are addressed
below in the section entitled Discussion of Comments.
In the NPRM, the FAA proposed amending and extending the termination date of Special Federal Aviation Regulation
(SFAR) No. 36, which allows authorized certificate holders (domestic repair stations, air carriers, air taxi operators
of large aircraft, and commercial operators of large aircraft) to approve aircraft products and articles for return
to service after accomplishing major repairs using data developed by the holder that have not been approved by the
FAA. Currently, more than 40 air carrier and domestic repair station certificate holders currently have SFAR 36 authorizations
that will terminate on January 23, 1994.
Since the SFAR was initially adopted in 1978, some of the regulatory language has received differing field interpretation.
As a result, some repaired products have been returned to service by SFAR 36 authorization holders that did not have
return to service authority. These interpretations are the result of changes in the repair industry since the initial
adoption of the rule. The original SFAR 36 did not foresee that some repair stations would be authorized only to perform
maintenance on parts or components of articles without authorization to return them to service. These interpretations
of eligibility have allowed several SFAR 36 authorizations to be issued and used inconsistently with the original
intent of the SFAR.
An aircraft ``product'' is an aircraft, airframe, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance. An aircraft ``article''
is an airframe, powerplant, propeller, instrument, radio, or accessory. Although some repair stations are authorized
only to perform maintenance on parts of articles or products, some SFAR 36 authorizations were used by these repair
station certificate holders to approve the articles and products for return to service.
The FAA has found that while repair stations that specialize in the repair of parts or components of aircraft articles
or products may have the technical capability and scope sufficient for the individual repair, they do not necessarily
possess the overall knowledge necessary for returning an article or product to service. Only repair stations and
air carriers that understand the form, fit, and function of an aircraft article or product should be authorized to
approve that article or product for return to service after a major repair. Furthermore, one must understand the form,
fit, and function of the article or product in order to fully evaluate the ramifications of a major repair being developed
for that article or product. When the FAA finds that a repair station or air carrier has that necessary understanding,
the FAA issues it a certificate and operations specifications commensurate with that finding, and the repair station
or air carrier is granted return to service authority. This higher level of certitude by the FAA in the work and knowledge
of the repair station or carrier that is authorized to approve the rated article or product for return to service is
the basis for the SFAR 36 authorization to develop and use data for major repairs without FAA approval of the data. The
preamble to the original SFAR 36 reflected this intent to limit the authorization to these repair stations and carriers
when it discussed the need to have damaged aircraft repaired and returned to service as quickly as possible. The SFAR
36 system was never intended to support repairs accomplished further up in the repair stream.


History


Prior to the adoption of SFAR 36, certificate holders that were qualified to make repairs were required to obtain FAA
approval on a case-by-case basis for data they had developed to perform major repairs. The only alternative to the
time-consuming, case-by-case approval method was to petition for and obtain an exemption granting relief from the
regulation. The number of exemptions being granted indicated that revisions to the Federal Aviation Regulations
(FAR) were necessary, and SFAR 36 was adopted on January 23, 1978, as an interim rulemaking action. Adoption of the
SFAR eliminated the requirement for authorized certificate holders to petition for exemption from the regulation,
and allowed the FAA additional time to obtain the information necessary to develop a permanent rule change. Most of
the affected certificate holders, however, did not use the provisions of SFAR 36 until it was well into its second year
and nearing its expiration date of January 23, 1980. Since the FAA did not yet have sufficient data upon which to base
a permanent rule change, the termination data for SFAR 36 was extended to January 23, 1982.
Although the FAA has considered consolidating certain authorizations along with those issued under SFAR 36 to make
them permanent parts of the regulations, no rulemaking action has been undertaken, and SFAR 36 has been extended three
times. Currently, permanent regulatory action is under consideration by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee
(ARAC).

Synopsis of the Rule




Section 1




The FAA defines aircraft ``product,'' ``article,'' and ``component'' for the purpose of the SFAR. The definitions
explain more clearly an authorization holder's return to service authority.




Section 2




The FAA restates the general provisions of the current SFAR in terms applicable to the individual types of eligible
certificate holders. Paragraph (c) of section 2 clarifies that an SFAR 36 authorization does not expand the scope
of authority of a repair station certificate holder; i.e., it does not give a repair station return to service authority
for any article for which it is not rated or change the articles it is rated to repair.




Section 3




Section 3 states that an authorized certificate holder may approve an aircraft product or article for return to service
after accomplishing a major repair, using data not approved by the Administrator, only in accordance with the amended
SFAR. Section 3 requires that the data used to perform the major repair be developed and ``approved'' in accordance
with the holder's authorization and procedures manual. Section 3 also enables an authorization holder to use its
developed repair data on a subsequent repair of the same type of product or article. For each subsequent repair, the
holder must determine that accomplishment of the repair, using previously developed data, will return the product
or article to its original or properly altered condition and will conform to all applicable airworthiness requirements.
In addition, each subsequent use of the data would have to be recorded in the authorization holder's SFAR records.




Section 4


Section 4 describes the procedures for applying for an SFAR 36 authorization.




Section 5


Section 5 identifies the requirements a certificate holder must meet to be eligible for an SFAR 36 authorization.
Paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (b) define the personnel required and incorporate clarifying changes from the current
SFAR. Paragraph (c) contains the reporting requirement of the current SFAR that pertains to changes that could affect
the holder's continuing ability to meet the SFAR requirements.




Section 6


Section 6 describes the procedures manual requirements. Paragraph (c) of section 6 requires that an authorization
holder that experiences a change in procedures or staff obtain and record FAA approval of the change in order to continue
to approve products or articles for return to service.

Section 7



Section 7 states that SFAR 36 terminates on January 23, 1999. All authorizations issued under this SFAR will terminate
on that date unless earlier surrendered, suspended, revoked, or otherwise terminated. Section 7 also allows previous
authorization holders to either surrender their SFAR 36-developed data to the FAA or to maintain the data indefinitely
and make it available to the FAA for inspection.



Section 8



Section 8 prohibits the transfer of an SFAR 36 authorization.



Section 9



Section 9 contains the inspection provisions of the current SFAR. It also emphasizes that the FAA must be able to determine
whether an applicant has, or a holder maintains, personnel adequate to comply with the provisions of the SFAR and any
additional limitations contained in the authorization.



Section 10



Section 10 re-emphasizes that an SFAR 36 authorization does not expand the scope of products or articles that an aircraft
operator or repair station is authorized to approve for return to service. This section also emphasizes that the authorization
allows a holder to approve for return to service a product or article after major repair performed by the holder using
data developed by the holder without FAA approval of that data.



Section 11



Section 11 contains the provision that each SFAR 36 authorization holder must comply with any additional limitations
prescribed by the Administrator and made a part of the authorization.



Sections 12 and 13



Sections 12 and 13 address data review and service experience requirements and record keeping requirements. Section
12 states the circumstances in which a holder will be required to submit the information necessary for corrective
action on a repair. Paragraph (b) of section 13 lists the identification information required rather than use the
term ``FAA identification,'' which has been the source of confusion in previous versions of the regulation.

As noted above, the termination date for SFAR 36 is January 23, 1999. The 5-year extension was chosen to allow enough
time for the ARAC to deliberate and forward a recommendation, and enough time for the FAA to deliberate and act upon
it. On or about the effective date of this final rule, each FAA office having jurisdiction over a current SFAR 36 authorization
will reevaluate each holder in terms of the amended rule. All current holders will be notified in writing as to whether
they continue to qualify under the amended rule.

The FAA will work with those holders that no longer qualify to establish, where possible, means to perform approved
major repairs. The means may include submitting repair data to an aircraft certification office (ACO) for approval,
utilizing a consultant designated engineering representative (DER) to approve the data, or employing a company
DER.

The extension of SFAR 36 will allow uninterrupted major repair activity by the current authorization holders that
qualify under the amended SFAR; those authorizations will be extended without the holders reapplying for authorization.
The extension will also allow a new, qualified applicant to obtain an authorization instead of petitioning for exemption
from the regulations.



Discussion of Comments



Interested persons were afforded the opportunity to participate in development of this rulemaking by submitting
written comments to the public regulatory docket on or before November 22, 1993. All comments received have been reviewed
and duly considered in promulgating this final rule; comments received after November 22, 1993, have been considered
to the extent possible without delaying this rulemaking action. Ten comments were received; two from foreign aviation
industry companies, three from domestic aviation industry companies, and five from domestic aviation industry
associations. One of the foreign commenters only requests a copy of the NPRM and does not offer substantive comments.
Of the remaining nine comments, one opposes the NPRM and four support it. The other four commenters do not declare agreement
or opposition to the NPRM, but submit comments and suggestions.

Four commenters state that a repair station that has the authority to return to service a product or article should
be able to develop and use major repair data for components or parts of those products and articles and return them to
service as well. One of these commenters suggested that the FAA meant to imply that air carriers and repair stations
that accomplish major repairs on products or articles are not qualified to accomplish major repairs on parts or components
of those products or articles. The FAA agrees that repair stations with the authority to return to service a product
or article are qualified and must be able to develop and use major repair data to perform repairs on components or parts
of those products or articles. The FAA disagrees, however, that the repair station should automatically be permitted
to return to service those components or parts, unless the components or parts are reinserted into the original product
or article before leaving the repair station. This SFAR addresses the development of major repair data; the issues
concerning accomplishing the repair and return to service authority for repair stations for components or parts
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking, and no changes are made to the NPRM pursuant to these comments.
Two commenters suggest that the final rule should allow current holders of the SFAR 36 authorization to continue to
use the authorization for the term of the extension, or until a permanent rule is in place. One of these commenters read
the NPRM to mean that repair stations currently conducting work under SFAR 36 must discontinue such work. The FAA disagrees;
the rule does not require that work be discontinued, but rather that the repair station performing the work be truly
qualified before returning an article to service. As was stated in the NPRM, some SFAR 36 authorizations were issued
in error, due to misinterpretations of the rule. The FAA has determined that the error must not continue and those authorizations
issued in error can not be extended without the authorization holders meeting all qualifications. The rule language
proposed in the NPRM is retained to clarify the qualifications.
One commenter is concerned that its current authorization may lapse on the termination date of January 23, 1994. To
ensure a smooth transition, current SFAR 36 authorization holders will be permitted to use their authorizations
until the FAA notifies them that they do not continue to qualify to hold the authorization.
One commenter proposes that the rule include a system of positive identification on the restored product with traceability
directly back to the facility performing the major repair and to the specific data package authorizing the major repair.
The FAA agrees that this issue has merit; however, such a requirement would add a substantial burden not proposed in
the NPRM. The suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Future documents such as Advisory Circulars, FAA
Orders, or other rulemaking projects, including those developed in the ARAC, may consider this suggestion, if applicable.
One commenter suggests allowing foreign repair stations to use SFAR 36 authorizations to develop and use major repair
data. The FAA disagrees; SFAR 36 has never been available to foreign repair stations. The resources and database systems
currently available to oversee foreign operations are not sufficient to adequately monitor such SFAR 36 authorizations.
The rule will not be expanded to include foreign repair stations.
One commenter suggests that the current SFAR 36 does not need clarification, but rather   145.51(b) and
145.53 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, which address return to service authority and maintenance of rated items,
need to be enforced. The FAA disagrees; the erroneous issuance of SFAR 36 authorizations demonstrates that ambiguity
exists in the current rule. The rule sections cited by the commenter are not at issue in improper SFAR 36 authorizations.
Increased enforcement of other regulations would not change the ambiguity that exists in SFAR 36.
One commenter suggests that the three subsections of section 2 of the rule be considered into one paragraph, along
with other minor revisions. The FAA realizes that some of the material in these subsections is repeated, but the subsections
do refer to different sections of the regulations. Part of the confusion with the current SFAR stems from the very combinations
of information suggested by the commenter. Section 2 was divided into three sections in order to clarify what is available
to different applicants.

One commenter suggests that section 6 of the NPRM be amended to add that the Administrator must approve within 15 days
a change in repair station staff necessary to meet other requirements of the regulation or a change in procedures approved
under a separate paragraph of the regulation. The FAA disagrees; often, more than 15 days is needed to conduct research
necessary to verify a new staff member's background and ability or to evaluate procedures. The FAA can not grant approval
to necessary staff personnel or procedures without thoroughly investigating all issues involved to ensure that
the level of safety intended by the rule continues to be met. No time limit for FAA approval will be added to Section 6.
One commenter states that the qualifications of the SFAR 36 staff engineering personnel should be consistent with
qualifications assigned to Designated Engineering Representatives with regard to damage tolerance requirements.
The FAA agrees; this issue is addressed in Section 5(a)(3), which identifies engineering personnel that can determine
compliance with the applicable airworthiness requirements of the regulations. Therefore, no change is made to the
final rule.
Two commenters propose that section 5 of the SFAR be amended to state that the applicant must have authority to repair
products or articles to be eligible to apply for an SFAR 36 authorization. The FAA agrees that this is a helpful clarification;
the final rule incorporates this change.
One commenter proposes that the words ``article'' and ``product'' should both appear wherever one is currently used
to encompass all items intended. The FAA agrees in part, and has further determined that the final rule should reflect
one term where one most clearly states the applicability of the corresponding provision. For example, FAR Section
121.379(b) states that a certificate holder may approve for return to service a 

product

 after maintenance, etc., performed under paragraph (a) of Section 121.379. FAR Section 145.51b states that a repair
station certificate holder may approve for return to service any 

article

 for which it is rated. Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to use ``product'' when referring to repairs performed
by air carrier and air taxi certificate holders, and to use ``article'' when referring to repairs performed by repair
station certificate holders; the final rule uses both terms where it does not distinguish between the certificate
holders.
One commenter suggests that clarification is needed as to whether a repair station may continue to utilize major repair
data developed previously under its SFAR 36 authorization if that authorization ceases, terminates, or expires.
The FAA agrees that a clarification is needed. A holder whose authorization has expired or has been terminated may
not use data previously developed under its authorization to perform a major repair and return the product or article
to service; the relevant provisions of FAR parts 121, 127, and 145 cited in Section 2 of the proposed and final rule prohibit
that return to service.
In addition, Section 7 of the final rule requires the holder to surrender its SFAR 36-developed data to the FAA. However,
the FAA acknowledges that a holder whose authorization has expired or been terminated may have a legitimate future
use for the data; e.g., the holder may apply to the FAA to have the data approved. Accordingly, to accommodate the FAA's
continued airworthiness concerns and a holder's interest in data it has developed, Section 7 of the final rule has
been revised to allow a former authorization holder to surrender its SFAR 36-developed data, or maintain its data
indefinitely and make the data available to the FAA for inspection.

Regulatory Evaluation


This section summarizes the regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA on the amendments to 14 CFR parts 121, 127, 135,
and 145_Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36, Development of Major Repair Data. This summary and the full regulatory
evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector
consumers, and Federal, State, and local governments.
The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive Order
12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this final rule are summarized
below. (A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full regulatory evaluation in the docket for
this final rule).


Cost Analysis


The FAA estimates that the one-time total cost of compliance will be approximately $55 for the industry and about $840
for the FAA. This cost estimate was derived based upon two components: (1) Current SFAR 36 certificate holders (that
will not qualify under the amended rule) applying for a DER, and (2) FAA costs to review SFAR 36 and DER authorizations.


Benefit Analysis


The final rule, with the amended extension date, will allow certain firms to continue to operate under SFAR 36, and
will avoid economic hardship to those relying on it as it presently exists. The final rule will also eliminate ambiguities
that exist in the present rule. These ambiguities have allowed component repair stations that do not have return to
service authorization to receive SFAR 36 authorizations. Repair stations that specialize in component or piece
parts of products (instead of aircraft engines or air frames, for example) and are not returning those products to
service, do not necessarily possess the overall knowledge necessary for returning an article or product to service.
Only repair stations and air carriers that understand the form, fit, and function of an aircraft article or product
should be authorized to approve that article or product for return to service after a major repair.
There have been no known documented instances where aviation safety has been compromised as a result of these repaired
products being returned. Nevertheless, the level of certitude should not be compromised, and only those that understand
the form, fit, and function of the product should be permitted to return the product to service.
The benefits of this action are the potential improvements in aviation safety.


Comparison of Costs and Benefits


The costs associated with this final rule ($55 to industry and $840 to the FAA) are minimal. In view of the negligible
costs of the rule, coupled with benefits in the form of enhanced safety to all aircraft operators, the FAA has determined
that the rule will be cost-beneficial.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The costs associated with this final rule are below any threshold
established by FAA Order 2100.143A. Therefore, the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on any small
entity.



International Trade Impact Assessment



This final rule will have neither an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries since it does not impose costs on aircraft
operators or U.S. or foreign aircraft manufacturers.



Federalism Implications



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, nor the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Justification for Immediate Adoption



The FAA has determined that delay in the adoption of this rule would cause undue burden to qualified domestic repair
stations, air carriers, air taxi operators with large aircraft, and commercial operators of large aircraft. These
companies use their SFAR 36 authorizations to develop and use data not formerly approved by the FAA for major repairs
on products and articles. Current SFAR 36 authorizations will terminate on January 23, 1994, and this rule must be
effective for the companies affected to continue to use data developed under the authorization to perform major repairs.
Accordingly, the FAA has determined that good cause exists to make this rule effective in less than 30 days.



Conclusion
