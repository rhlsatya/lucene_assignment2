Petitions for Rulemaking





Docket No.:

 27532.



Petitioner:

 Air Transport Association.



Regulations Affected:

 14 CFR 121.343(c).



Description of Rulechange Sought:

 To allow operators to complete a phased compliance schedule for installation of the 11-parameter digital flight
data recorders (DFDR) on aircraft between December 31, 1994, and December 31, 1999, and eliminate the need to make
costly DFDR retrofit to aircraft that will not be in the U.S. airline inventory at the end of the decade.



Petitioner's Reason for the Request:

 The petitioner feels that this amendment will save ATA operators alone $23,700,000; retrofit installation is not
supported via an aircraft manufacturer service bulletin, since the majority of aircraft models affected by the rule
are out of production; and any enhancement to the collection of flight history data may be of minimal benefit for the
airplanes that are to be retired between 1994 and 1999.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T89-05-52 by adopting
a new AD, applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines. Telegraphic AD T89-05-52
currently requires repetitive ultrasonic inspections of a combustion chamber outer case (CCOC) weld, but also allows
visual inspection or fluorescent magnetic penetrant inspection (FMPI) of certain CCOC's under specified conditions.
This proposal would allow ultrasonic inspections only. This proposal is prompted by the greater availability of
ultrasonic inspection equipment, which provides a more definitive means of discovering cracks than either visual
inspections or FMPI. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent rupture of the CCOC, which could
result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft damage.

Discussion



On March 1, 1989, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) 
T89-05-52, applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, which requires repetitive
ultrasonic inspections for cracks in the combustion chamber outer case (CCOC). In addition, that telegraphic AD
allowed operators who did not have ultrasonic inspection capability to perform visual inspections and fluorescent
magnetic penetrant inspections (FMPI) of CCOC's. That action was prompted by reports of two CCOC's, both part number
(P/N) 796761, which were found in service with severe cracking and distress at the weld which joins the forward case
detail to the rear flange detail. These cracks initiated from an area of incomplete weld created during the manufacturing
process and were not detected during the final inspection process. Another CCOC, P/N 806675, is manufactured using
a similar process and has the same potential for incomplete welds, but to date have not been found cracked. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in rupture of the CCOC, which could result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft
damage. 

Since the issuance of that telegraphic AD, the FAA has received reports that most operators now have the capability
to perform ultrasonic inspections, which provides a more definitive means of discovering cracks than either visual
inspections or FMPI. In telegraphic AD T89-05-52, reinspection of all CCOC's is required, including
reinspection of those CCOC's that exhibited minimal ultrasonic indications during initial inspection. The FAA
has determined analytically that CCOC's that exhibit maximum signal amplitudes of less than 40 percent are not life
limited at the defined weld area. Therefore, CCOC's that meet this signal criteria for two consecutive ultrasonic
inspections may be marked with a new P/N, provided the second ultrasonic inspection is accomplished at least 2,500
cycles in service (CIS) after the first inspection and the second inspection is performed in accordance with Appendix
C of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990. 

Finally, the FAA has determined that certain CCOC's, P/N 806675, were ultrasonically inspected by PW during the manufacturing
process, and therefore do not need to be inspected again until they are accessible in the shop. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, that
describes procedures for repetitive ultrasonic inspections of CCOC's for cracks. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
the proposed AD would supersede telegraphic AD T89-05-52 to require repetitive ultrasonic inspections
of CCOC's for cracks. The proposed AD would also allow CCOC's that meet certain signal criteria for two consecutive
ultrasonic inspections to be marked with a new P/N. Once remarked, those CCOC's would not need to meet the repetitive
ultrasonic inspection requirements of this AD. Finally, the proposed AD would require ultrasonic inspections on
certain CCOC's, P/N 806675, identified by serial number, that were ultrasonically inspected by PW during the manufacturing
process, when they are accessible in the shop. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously. 

The FAA estimates that 1,000 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD,
that it would take approximately 2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $110,000. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace
Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes. This proposal would require that certain landing
gear brakes be inspected for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the
specified wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This proposal is prompted
by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) and was unable to stop on the
runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy
RTO.

Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 93-NM-167-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion 



In 1988, a McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplane was involved in an aborted takeoff accident in which
eight of the ten brakes failed and the airplane ran off the end of the runway. Investigation revealed that there were
failed pistons on each of the eight brakes, with O-rings damaged by over-extension due to extensive wear. Fluid leaking
from the damaged pistons caused the hydraulic fuses to close, releasing all brake pressure. 

This accident prompted a review of allowable wear limits for all brakes installed on transport category airplanes.
The FAA and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) jointly developed a set of dynamometer test guidelines that
could be used to validate appropriate wear limits for all airplane brakes. It should be noted that this worn brake accountability
determination validates brake wear limits with respect to brake energy capacity only and is not meant to account for
any reduction in brake force due solely to the wear state of the brake. The guidelines for validating brake wear limits
allow credit for use of reverse thrust with a critical engine inoperative to determine the energy level absorbed by
the brake during the dynamometer test. 

The FAA has requested that airframe manufacturers of transport category airplanes: (1) Determine required adjustments
in allowable wear limits for all of its brakes in use; (2) schedule dynamometer testing to validate wear limits as necessary;
and (3) submit information from items (1) and (2) to the FAA so that appropriate rulemaking action(s) can be initiated.


British Aerospace has conducted worn brake rejected takeoff (RTO) dynamometer testing and analyses on various brakes
installed on Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes. Based on the results of that testing and
analyses, the FAA has determined that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance
Manual for Model BAC 1-11-200 series airplanes equipped with brakes manufactured by Allied Signal Aerospace
Company (Bendix) are acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness of the brakes during a high energy RTO. The FAA
also finds that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance Manual for Model
BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes equipped with Bendix brakes are not acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness
of the brakes during a high energy RTO. Consequently, the FAA has determined that the brake wear limits for Model BAC
1-11-200 series airplanes and the new brake wear limits for Model BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes
must be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 

The FAA has determined that, in order to prevent loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO, the following
maximum brake wear limits are necessary for Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes equipped
with Bendix brakes: 






This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require that certain landing gear brakes be inspected
for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the specified wear limits
be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 
There are approximately 100 Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. 
The FAA estimates that 10 Model BAC 1-11-200 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators would
be affected by this proposed AD. For these airplanes and operators, although the proposed rule would require the incorporation
of maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional
action, inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement would be involved; such actions are currently
a part of the current maintenance program. However, it is estimated that it would take approximately 1 work hour, at
an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the requirement into its FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed requirement to revise
the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1-11-200 series airplanes
is estimated to be $110, or $55 per operator. 
The FAA estimates that 20 Model BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 19 U.S. operators would
be affected by this proposed AD. It is estimated that it would take approximately 1 work hour, at an average labor rate
of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the proposed revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection
program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that proposed requirement on U.S. operators of Model BAC
1-11-400 series airplanes is estimated to be $1,045, or $55 per operator. 
Additionally, the FAA estimates that for operators of Model BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes, it would take
approximately 2 work hours per airplane to shorten the wear pins for replacement brakes, and 8 work hours per airplane
to change the brakes, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change
in wear limits for these airplanes (that is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they
are worn to their previously approved limits for a one-time change) would be approximately $912 per airplane. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of these proposed requirements on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1-11-400
series airplanes is estimated to be $29,240, or $1,462 per airplane. 
These total cost figures are based on the assumption that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements
of this AD. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

The Proposed Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend 
14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:


 



Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 






British Aerospace: 

Docket 93-NM-167-AD. 





Applicability: 

All Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes, certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy rejected takeoff (RTO), accomplish the following:




(a) Within 180 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD. 


(1) Inspect main landing gear brakes having the brake part numbers listed below for wear. Any brake worn more than the
maximum wear limit specified below must be replaced, prior to further flight, with a brake within that limit.








Note 1: 

Measuring instructions for Bendix brakes can be found in Revision 4 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual.



Note 2: 

Revision 4 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual specifies a brake wear limit of 1.06 inch for brake part
number 2601240-1. That brake wear limit is superseded by the brake wear limit of 1.0 inch specified above for
that brake part number. Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual will reflect the revised brake
wear limit of 1.0 inch. Brake units having wear indicators set at 1.06 inch will be considered to be fully worn when either
wear indicator pin is 1.0 inch or less above the surface of the carrier, provided the wear pin has not been shortened
on that brake unit. 


Note 3: 

Each operator should provide a method of identifying modified brakes until Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component
Maintenance Manual has been issued. Revision 5 of the manual will define a method of brake identification and reflect
the brake wear limits specified above. A paint scheme similar to that used to differentiate between new and refurbished
brakes could be used, for example, if a different color is used. 



(2) Incorporate into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program the maximum brake wear limits specified in
paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. 
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, 
ANM-113. 





Note 4: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113. 



(c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location
where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Bullhead City, AZ. A Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance
Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Bullhead
Laughlin Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft
executing the approach. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations at Bullhead Laughlin Municipal Airport.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The National Institute of Standards and Technology requests comments on the proposed amendments contained in this
document to the regulations found at part 290 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which implement the Regional
Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology. This change revises the matching fund requirements in the
fifth and sixth years of operation to reflect program experience during the first five years. With this change, the
maximum allowable Federal funding will be one third of total expenses during years five and six. Currently, the maximum
allowable Federal funding is 30 percent in year five and 20 percent in year six. This change also modifies the requirements
for cash match. With this change, at least half of the match must be in cash or full-time personnel loaned to the operating
organization. Currently at least 55 percent of the match must be in cash or full-time personnel.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The National Institute of Standards and Technology requests comments regarding proposed changes to the matching
funds requirements for the Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology (Manufacturing Technology
Centers, MTC) program found at part 290 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The MTC program provides financial
and technical assistance to regional centers (MTCs) which work directly with small and medium sized manufacturing
firms to advance their level of manufacturing technology. The MTCs are selected on a competitive basis in accordance
with the regulation at 15 CFR part 290.


Part of the funding for each MTC is provided by a Federal cooperative agreement and the balance (the ``match'') is provided
through a variety of means by the operating organization. The match is generally provided as a combination of non-Federal
public funds or in-kind match, contributions of cash or in-kind resources from private sources, and earned income
of the MTC. The authorizing legislation allows Federal funding of up to half the total budget (cash and in-kind) in
the first three years and requires that the Secretary adopt regulations which specify a declining level of Federal
support during the next three years. The current regulation specifies those maximum funding levels to be 40 percent,
30 percent, and 20 percent in years four through six respectively. The changes proposed to part 290 will specify those
maximum funding levels to be 40 percent, 1/3, and 1/3 in years four through six respectively.
The current regulation requires that 55 percent of the match be in cash or full-time personnel. There is no statutory
requirement for this cash ratio. The changes proposed to part 290 will specify that half of the match be in cash or full-time
personnel.


Classification


This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel
has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that this rule will not have a significant
economic effect on a substantial number of small entities requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act because the proposed rule changes will affect only those governmental units that are selected to
receive funding under the Program. The program is entirely voluntary for the participants that seek funding. It is
not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. The
Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology Program does not involve the mandatory payment of
any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state or local government. Accordingly,
the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not applicable to this program. This
notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM-10 Implementation Plan for Montana 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action EPA proposes approval of the state implementation plan (SIP) for the Columbia Falls, Montana nonattainment
area submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10).
The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate
nonattainment area PM-10 SIP for Columbia Falls. EPA is also proposing approval of the Flathead County Air Pollution
Control Program. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The Columbia Falls, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM-10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.327 (specifying designation for Columbia Falls and vicinity). The
air quality planning requirements for moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas are set out in Subparts 1 and 4 of Title
I of the Act.
 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM-10
nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in today's proposal and the supporting rationale.
In today's rulemaking action on the Montana moderate PM-10 SIP, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations
considering the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before
taking final action on today's proposal. 





Those States containing initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things,
the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 
1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act. 
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM-10
by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15,
1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has
failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM-10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9)
and 57 FR 13510-13512, 13543-13544.

II. This Action 


EPA is today proposing approval of the Columbia Falls PM-10 nonattainment area control plan. The Columbia Falls
SIP consists of two submittals. The first contains the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program and Air Pollution
Plan regulations. Flathead County contains two PM

10

 nonattainment areas for which SIPs were due in November 1991: Columbia Falls and Kalispell. The Flathead County regulations
apply to both areas and were submitted with the attainment demonstration for Kalispell on November 25, 1991, after
being approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991. The Columbia
Falls SIP and attainment demonstration were not submitted at that time since a permit necessary to the control strategy
for the SIP was not finalized. The MBHES issued that permit and approved the SIP on January 24, 1992. This second submittal
to EPA was made by the Governor on May 6, 1992. Final technical corrections to the SIP were received by EPA on June 15,
1993. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the Flathead County rules (with the exception of rules 501 through
506 which are specific to the city of Kalispell_EPA will take separate action on the Kalispell PM

10

 nonattainment area control plan) and the Columbia Falls PM

10

 nonattainment area control plan. 
To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State adopted commitments after public hearings on November 15, 1991
and January 24, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA with the Governor's May 6, 1992 letter, as additional tasks
to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Columbia Falls and statewide SIP. The State has fulfilled commitments
related to SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Those items related
to deficiencies in the statewide SIP will be addressed in a separate action. EPA has determined that the Columbia Falls
SIP can be fully approved without the State fulfilling the remaining commitments. Therefore, EPA is tracking the
State's efforts to meet these commitments, but approval of the SIP for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area is not
contingent upon the State meeting them by the specified dates (a more detailed discussion of these commitments can
be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for this proposed action). 
The State has made a separate commitment to testing and further dispersion modeling of emissions from the Columbia
Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC) facility. This facility is located outside the nonattainment area and emissions from
CFAC were not identified on the Chemical Mass Balance analysis of filters collected from the monitor in the Columbia
Falls nonattainment area. Emissions from CFAC are a potential concern, however, since this source accounts for 20
percent of the emission inventory (at permitted allowable emissions). EPA will continue to monitor the testing and
assist the State with any action required by the results. 
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
In today's action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of those elements of the Columbia Falls PM-10 plan that
were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted by the State on November 25, 1991, and May 6, 1992 (excluding the Kalispell
portion of the county regulations). EPA believes that the Columbia Falls plan meets those applicable requirements
of the Act. 
Since the Columbia Falls PM-10 SIP was not submitted by November 15, 1991, as required by section 189(a)(2)(A)
of the Act, EPA made a finding that the State failed to submit the SIP, pursuant to section 179 of the Act, and notified
the Governor in a letter dated December 16, 1991. See 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992). After the Columbia Falls PM-10
SIP was submitted on May 6, 1992, EPA found the submittal complete pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act and notified
the Governor accordingly in a letter dated August 7, 1992. This completeness determination corrected the State's
deficiency and, therefore, terminated the sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act. 


A. Analysis of State Submission 


1. Procedural Background 


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 





The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission.
However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months
after receipt of the submission.

<TEXT>
 

To entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Columbia Falls, the State of Montana held a public hearing
on November 15, 1991, for the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program. A second hearing was held on January 24,
1992, to address the Plum Creek Manufacturing, Inc. permit and the Columbia Falls PM-10 SIP. The State supplied
evidence that adequate public notice for these hearings was provided. Following the public hearings, the local air
pollution control plan and the Columbia Falls PM-10 SIP were adopted by the State. The submittal for the Flathead
County Air Pollution Control Program was signed by the Governor on November 25, 1991. The submittal for the final Columbia
Falls PM-10 SIP was signed by the Governor on May 6, 1992. The final plan was received by EPA on May 12, 1992 as a proposed
revision to the SIP. 

The SIP revisions were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set
out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter, dated August 7, 1992, was
forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review
process. In today's action EPA proposes to approve the Montana PM-10 SIP submittals for Columbia Falls, as dated
November 25, 1991 (with the exception of the Kalispell specific rules) and May 6, 1992, with technical revisions dated
June 15, 1993, and invites public comment on the action. 



2. Accurate Emission Inventory 



Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emission inventory
also should include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because
the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration
that the area cannot practicably attain), the emission inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR
13539). 

Columbia Falls' base year emission inventory was developed for July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990. The results were
segregated into seasonal winter and spring emissions. On an annual basis, industrial facilities account for 56.5%
of the PM-10 emissions, with industrial processes and fugitive industrial road dust responsible for 78.8 and
21.2% of this percentage, respectively. Area sources account for 43% of the total annual PM-10 emissions, with
re-entrained road dust responsible for 89% of all area source contributions. Residential wood burning area sources
accounted for 4.3% of total annual PM-10 emissions in Columbia Falls. The emission inventory shows that the
emissions are seasonal, with re-entrained road dust the primary source in the summer and industrial sources the largest
contributor during the fall, winter, and spring. 

EPA is proposing to approve the emission inventory because it is accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient
basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements
of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.

 For further details see the TSD for this proposed action. 





3. RACM (Including RACT) 



As noted, the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble
contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539-13545
and 13560-13561).

Five sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM-10 nonattainment problem in Columbia
Falls. In the following table, an outline is presented on these sources, their control measures and associated emissions
reduction credit, and effective dates. 








A more detailed discussion of the source/source category contributions and their associated control measures (including
available control technology) can be found in the TSD for this proposed action. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation
and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's
PM-10 nonattainment plan will result in the attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this
action EPA is proposing to approve the Columbia Falls PM-10 plan's RACM (including RACT) in its entirety.

4. Demonstration



As noted, the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than December
31, 1994, or the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994 is impracticable (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of
the Act). The attainment demonstration for Columbia Falls was conducted using receptor modeling (CMB) and rollback
modeling. The 24-hour PM-10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter (

g/m

3

), and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration
above 150 

m

g/m

3

 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual PM-10 NAAQS is 50 

m

g/m

3

, and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 

m

g/m

 (id.) 

The demonstration for Columbia Falls indicates that the 24-hour PM-10 NAAQS will be attained by December 31,
1994 at 136.3 

m

g/m

3

, and it will be maintained in future years. The demonstration indicated that an annual concentration of 31.1 

m

g/m

3

 will be achieved by 1995,

5

 showing attainment of the annual PM-10 NAAQS. Ambient monitoring has not measured an exceedance of the PM-10
NAAQS in Columbia Falls since 1987. The control strategies used to achieve these design concentrations are summarized
in the section titled ``RACM (including RACT).'' For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration
and the control strategies used, see the TSD for this proposed action.






5. PM-10 Precursors



The control requirements that are applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 also apply to major stationary
sources of PM-10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10
levels over the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). An analysis of air quality and emissions data for
the Columbia Falls nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct
particulate emissions from re-entrained road dust, stationary sources and residential wood burning. Neither the
emission inventory nor the CMB analysis for Columbia Falls revealed any major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors.
Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major sources of precursors of PM-10 do not contribute significantly
to PM-10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequences of this proposed finding are to exclude these sources
from the applicability of PM-10 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses
and supporting rationale for EPA's proposed finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this proposed action.
Note that while EPA is proposing to make a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character
of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future
growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing
such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 



6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress



The PM-10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined
in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). The State of Montana's PM-10
SIP indicates that the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES) and the Flathead County Health
Department (FCHD) will submit to EPA a reasonable further progress/milestone report consistent with federal guidelines
by December 31, 1994.

6







In addition, FCHD will prepare less detailed annual progress reports for the prior year by August 1st each year. These
annual progress reports shall provide information on the effectiveness of the control strategies for re-entrained
road dust. The MDHES will add a progress report for the Plum Creek facility. 

To monitor the progress of the road dust control rules, a report will be completed on the type and amount of de-icing
and sanding material applied, the number of applications of de-icing and sanding materials, the dates of application
of each material, and where and when the street sweeping and flushing occurred during the winter season. The sanding
material test results for the percent silt and durability also will be submitted.

<PARENT> FR940127-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

All exceedances of the PM-10 standard will be evaluated and a determination made as to the source of the exceedance.
Changes in the air quality program to prevent further exceedances and a timetable for implementation will be developed.
Any other EPA requirements for RFP reports will be incorporated as necessary. 



7. Enforceability Issues 



All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in
a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,


et al.

 (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control
measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act). 

The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above in section 3, ``RACM (including RACT).'' The
Columbia Falls air pollution control regulations, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by FCHD. Any person
who violates any provision or rule, with the exception of the voluntary solid-fuel burning device rule, or order under
this program shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500.00.

The Flathead County Pollution Control Program and the associated local regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES,
if the FCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental
Sciences (MBHES) in accordance with section 75-2-301 of the Montana Code Annotated and effectuated by
a MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement
provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, sections 75-2-401 through 75-2-429,
Montana Code Annotated. 

The emission limits for Plum Creek are enforceable by the MDHES through air quality permit 

#

2667-M with a final modification date of January 24, 1992. Section 75-2-401 of the Montana Code Annotated
allows the MDHES to seek civil penalties for a violation of a permit limitation. Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM)
16.8.1112 allows the MDHES to revoke a permit for a violation of a permit limitation. These regulations are contained
in the ARM 16.8.101 through 16.8.1602 and violations of these rules are punishable by civil penalties in an amount
up to $10,000 per day and criminal penalties in an amount up to $1,000 per day. 

If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii)
of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation
of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation when, for example, the
State has the authority and resources to implement the provision, and the local entity has failed to do so. 

The Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of section
75-2-301 of the Montana Code Annotated, as amended (1991). On November 15, 1991, the MBHES issued a board
order approving the local program and regulations. A stipulation between the MDHES and the Flathead County Air Pollution
Control Board that delineates responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and the local authorities was
signed November 15, 1991. The regulations, board order, and stipulation were submitted to EPA as a revision to the
Montana SIP. 

The State also submitted a state Attorney General's opinion interpreting the authority of the MDHES to enforce any
state and local air quality provisions if a local air quality program fails to do so. In practice, the MBHES issues a
board order when it approves a local program or amendments to a program. Since the Montana Clean Air Act authorizes
the MDHES to enforce board orders issued by the MBHES, the MDHES has the authority to assume jurisdiction over, and
implement, a local program so approved. However, the Montana Clean Air Act also requires a hearing before the MBHES
before such an assumption of jurisdiction and authority can be taken. 

The Flathead County rules are in effect now, as are the State's permit modification for Plum Creek. The State of Montana
has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the Columbia Falls PM-10 SIP are adequately enforced.
EPA believes that the State's and Columbia Falls' existing air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this
proposed action contains further information on enforceability requirements, responsibilities, and a discussion
of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures.

8. Contingency Measures



As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510-13512 and 13543-13544. These measures must
be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist
of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without
further action by the State or EPA, upon EPA's determination that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM-10
NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Columbia Falls nonattainment area SIP contains an outline of steps
to be taken if attainment of the PM-10 standard is not achieved; however, these steps do not adequately satisfy
the contingency measures requirement. Since the SIP does not provide for these measures to take effect without further
action should EPA determine that Columbia Falls has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM-10 standard by December
31, 1994, EPA is taking no action at this time on the Columbia Falls contingency measures. The State has until November
15, 1993 to submit its contingency measures.



III. Implications of This Action



EPA is proposing to approve the PM-10 SIP submitted to EPA on November 25, 1991 (with the exception of the Kalispell
specific rules, 501-506) and on May 6, 1992 for the Columbia Falls, Montana nonattainment area. Among other
things, the State of Montana has demonstrated that the Columbia Falls moderate PM-10 nonattainment area will
attain the PM-10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994.

EPA is also proposing to approve the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program as it applies to Columbia Falls,
which was submitted to EPA on November 25, 1991. The portion of the plan concerning the Kalispell PM-10 nonattainment
area will be acted upon in a separate action.

As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas are due at later dates.
The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.



IV. Request for Public Comments



The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA
will consider any comments received by February 28, 1994.



V. Executive Order (EO) 12866



This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on U.S. EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order
12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.



VI. Regulatory Flexibility



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Ohio 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to conditionally approve revisions to the emission limitations,
compliance methodologies, and compliance time schedules in Ohio's State Implementation Plan for sulfur dioxide
(SO

2

) as it applies to sources in Hamilton County. These revisions are being proposed in response to modeling analyses
which have predicted violations of the SO

2

 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) due to emissions from sources in Hamilton County.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


EPA's analysis is discussed in the following manner: I. Background; II. Attainment Demonstration; III. Compliance;
and IV. Proposed Action.


I. Background


The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved portions of the Ohio SO

2

 State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Hamilton County on January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8481), and April 20, 1982 (47 FR 16784),
and the remaining portion on May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20586). The portion of Hamilton County which was originally designated
a nonattainment area for SO

2

 was redesignated to attainment on March 19, 1982 (47 FR 11870). Hamilton County was divided into two separate attainment
areas on May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20586). However, since the time of those rulemakings, three modeling analyses have been
submitted to EPA which predicted violations of the SO

2

 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) due to SO

2

 emissions from existing sources that are located in Hamilton County, Ohio.
Based on the predicted violations, EPA notified the Governor of Ohio on December 22, 1988, under section 110(a)(2)(H)
of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H), that the SIP for SO

2

 is substantially inadequate to attain and maintain the SO

2

 NAAQS in Hamilton County. The notification provided the State with 60 days to submit a commitment and schedule for
the development of an approvable SIP and up to 18 months from the date of notification to submit a fully State adopted
SO

2

 plan for Hamilton County, which assures the attainment and maintenance of the SO

2

 NAAQS both in Hamilton County and the surrounding area.
On June 28, 1991, Valdas V. Adamkus, Regional Administrator, EPA, sent a letter to Donald R. Schregardus, Director,
OEPA formalizing an agreement between EPA and OEPA regarding action toward SO

2

 attainment status for Hamilton County, Ohio. On September 9, 1991, OEPA sent EPA a proposed revision to the Hamilton
County SO

2

 SIP. The signed State adopted rules were received by EPA on October 18, 1991. The rules package submitted for approval
consisted of revisions to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 3745-18-03 

Attainment Dates and Compliance Time Schedules

, (OAC) 3745-18-04 

Measurement Methods and Procedures

, and OAC 3745-18-37 

Hamilton County Emission Limits

, as well as a modeling analysis intended to demonstrate that the limits in these regulations are sufficient to assure
attainment of the NAAQS for SO

2

 in Hamilton County. A completeness review was performed and, on November 8, 1991, EPA determined that the package
was complete.
On May 7, 1992, William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section-Region 5, EPA, sent a letter to Robert
Hodanbosi, of the OEPA, detailing issues EPA had identified in the State's September 9, 1991 submittal. On March 19,
1993, the State responded with a subsequent submittal which addressed the above mentioned issues, and included a
Director's Finding and Order governing the operation of selected boilers at Cincinnati Gas and Electric's Miami
Fort facility. Additional technical information supporting the March 19th submittal was received from OEPA by EPA
on May 18, 1993.
A major issue in the development of the revised submittal involved the incorporation of the Rough Terrain Diffusion
Model (RTDM). The RTDM is one of many computer models available used to simulate the dispersion of air pollutants.
A ``Model Evaluation and Comparison Study'' was conducted by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, in cooperation
with the OEPA and EPA Region 5, in order to determine which model, or combination of models, (Industrial Source Complex
(ISC) Short-term model or the RTDM) was most accurate in predicting SO

2

 concentrations in Hamilton County. This study was conducted in accordance with a protocol that EPA agreed to on October
31, 1990, and in accordance with EPA document entitled ``Interim Procedures for Evaluating Air Quality Models (Revised),''
1984. Based on the results of the study, EPA approved the RTDM model for use in modeling sulfur dioxide sources in Hamilton
County in a June 9, 1992, letter from David Kee, Director, Air and Radiation Division, to Robert Hodanbosi, Chief,
Division of Air Pollution Control. The model/monitor comparison study is discussed more completely in the Technical
Support Document associated with this document.


II. Attainment Demonstration


The principal requirement for the Ohio SO

2

 SIP under section 110, as identified in the SIP deficiency notice, is that the plan provides sufficient enforceable
measures to assure attainment of the NAAQS for SO

2

. As noted above, the State provided enforceable limits in the form of State regulations, supplemented by an administrative
order for one source, along with an air dispersion modeling analysis which demonstrates that these limits assure
attainment in the Hamilton County area. The modeling techniques used in the demonstration supporting this revision
were based on procedures in the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised),'' July 1986, including ``Supplement
A,'' July 1987. The modeling methodology is discussed more fully in the Technical Support Document.
The attainment demonstration incorporated three different air dispersion models: Industrial Source Complex Short-Term
(ISCST), COMPLEX I (Valley Screen Mode for analyzing intermediate terrain), and the Rough Terrain Diffusion Model
(RTDM). Some basic components of the modeling methodology are:



Meteorological Data-The ISCST modeling used the most recent five years of meteorological data while RTDM used
one year of meteorological data collected in Hamilton County. 

Rural/Urban Classification-Western Hamilton County sources were modeled in the Rural mode while sources
in the east were modeled using Urban mode 3. 

Emission Inventory-The emission sources used in the modeling represent maximum short-term operating rates
and stack parameters. Actual operating factors were gathered and used to evaluate annual SO

2

 predicted concentrations. 

Background Concentrations-The 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual averaging background concentrations were determined
for both the eastern and western grids. The background values were based on monitoring data and are considered representative
of SO

2

 concentrations being contributed from unmodeled sources in the Hamilton County area. 
Good Engineering Practice (GEP) stack heights or actual stack heights, where appropriate, were used in Ohio's modeling
in accordance with EPA guidance. However, a January 22, 1988, remand in a U.S. D.C. Court of Appeals case involving
EPA stack height regulations remains unresolved

1

. It is possible that future resolution of this case will result in the State being required to revise the emission limitations
for the CG&E Miami Fort facility. 





In the modeling for the attainment demonstration for Hamilton County, the State did not use the most recent version
of the Industrial Source Complex model, known as ISC2. The ISC2 version of the Industrial Source Complex model was
released after the State submitted its SIP to EPA, and well after the completion of the ISCST modeling used to determine
appropriate SIP limits. Consequently, EPA proposes to accept analysis under the older model for the purpose of this
SIP review. However, acceptance of the ISCST analysis for this reason should not apply to any other analysis of this
area to support any future regulatory action. 
Although the majority of the attainment demonstration was comprised of output from ISCST, several areas of Hamilton
County were modeled using RTDM. The RTDM modeling was performed in accordance with the EPA approved ``Model Evaluation
and Comparison Study'' described earlier. The modeling demonstration accompanying the SIP revision submittal
incorporated dispersion modeling output from the ISCST model in combination with RTDM.
The issues identified in the May 7, 1992, letter from William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section-Region
5, EPA to Robert Hodanbosi, of the OEPA, regarding the September 9, 1991 submittal, needed to be resolved before EPA
could approve the SIP revisions. One of those issues involved modeled SO

2

 violations near the Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc. (Seagram's) facility in Dearborn County, Indiana. These modeled
violations were primarily due to emissions from the Seagrams facility in Indiana. However, CG&E, located in
Hamilton County, Ohio, contributed to the critical concentration in that area. 
 In response to the modeled violation, a commitment has been obtained from Seagram's, formalized in a letter from Seagrams
to both the OEPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, dated September 1, 1992, agreeing to not
operate its two boilers simultaneously on sulfur-bearing fuels without written permission from both State Agencies.
Utilizing this commitment, the OEPA submitted supplementary modeling which demonstrated that areas near Seagrams,
in Indiana, did not exceed the sulfur dioxide NAAQS. However, in order for the Seagrams limit to be federally enforceable,
it must be incorporated into the Indiana sulfur dioxide SIP. Therefore, the Hamilton County SO

2

 SIP revision will be approved if the Seagrams commitment, described above, is adopted into the Indiana SO

2

 SIP within one year from the date of publication of the Hamilton County SO

2

 SIP revision final rulemaking. This issue and other issues addressed by Ohio's submittals of March 19, 1993, and May
18, 1993, are discussed in detail in the Technical Support Document. 
Based on the foregoing, EPA concludes that the results from Ohio's modeling demonstration, utilizing the ISCST and
RTDM air dispersion models, show that when the applicable emission limits and other restrictions are imposed, attainment
of the NAAQS for SO

2

 will be demonstrated in and around Hamilton County.


III. Compliance


The general compliance determination method denoted in OAC 3745-18-04(D)(7), which applies specifically
to Hamilton County, utilizes stack gas sampling using Methods 1 through 4 and 6, 6A, 6B, or 6C, as specified in 40 CFR
60.46, for any fuel burning equipment. Additional compliance monitoring is required under OAC 3745-18-04(D)(8),
which, on a source-specific basis, requires either daily or weekly coal sampling. EPA has determined, based on guidance
contained in the ``General preamble for future proposed rulemakings,'' published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that compliance methods 1 through 4, 6, 6A, 6B, and 6C, in conjunction with regular fuel
sampling, provide for continuous SO

2

 compliance monitoring. Additionally, documentation criteria listed in OAC 3745-18-04(I) requires
sources subject to the Hamilton County emission limits to document and retain information needed to demonstrate
compliance with applicable emission limits, emission tracking requirements, and/or operating limits.


IV. Proposed Action


Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act contains general requirements for implementation plans submitted by a State.
These are requirements which apply to all SIPs submitted by a State including attainment area plans, such as the plan
for Hamilton County. A fundamental requirement of this section is that each plan must include enforceable emission
limitations and other techniques necessary to meet the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act. EPA has determined
that the emission limits and control measures listed in the SO

2

 SIP revision for Hamilton County, when fully implemented, will be enforceable, and, will provide for attainment
of the NAAQS for SO

2

, and thus satisfy the applicable requirements. As stated above, this determination is contingent upon the Seagrams
limits being incorporated into the Indiana SO

2

 SIP and, as a result, made federally enforceable. 
 Therefore, EPA is proposing to conditionally approve revisions to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 3745-18-03,
3745-18-04, and 3745-18-37. The OAC rules 3745-18-03 

Attainment Dates and Compliance Time Schedules

 provide specific time schedules for sources receiving revised emission limits to implement necessary changes and
demonstrate compliance. The OAC rules 3745-18-04 

Measurement Methods and Procedures

 specify the compliance determination methodologies for sources receiving revised emission limits. The OAC rules
3745-18-37 

Hamilton County Emission Limits

 amend the sulfur dioxide emission limits for Hamilton County. EPA is also proposing to approve the Director's Findings
and Order containing a fuel quality limit for select sources at Cincinnati Gas and Electric's Miami Fort facility.

Under section 110(k)(4), pertaining to conditional approval, the SIP elements regarding the Seagrams limits must
be adopted by the State of Indiana, by a date not later than one year after the date of approval of the Hamilton County,
Ohio SIP revision. In addition, the adopting State must submit these rules to EPA within a reasonable time after such
adoption. In this case, if the State of Indiana fails to adopt or submit the necessary rules to EPA within the required
time frame (one year from the date of final approval of the Hamilton County, Ohio SO

2

 SIP revision), this approval would become a disapproval upon USEPA notification of Ohio by letter. The EPA subsequently
would publish a notice announcing this action in the 

Federal Register

. If the State of Indiana adopts and submits the rule within the above timeframe, the conditionally approved rules
would remain a part of the SIP pending final action on the new submittal. 
 
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on EPA's proposal to conditionally approve. Public
comments received by February 28, 1994 will be considered in the development of EPA's final rulemaking action.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. EPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866 for a period of 2 years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
 Conditional SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.


If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on a State's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not 


 have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because itdoes not remove existing state requirements
nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Designation of 
Critical Habitat for the Marbled Murrelet 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to designate critical habitat for the threatened marbled murrelet
(

Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus

) in Washington, Oregon, and California under the Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). The marbled murrelet
is a small seabird of the Alcidae family that forages in the near-shore marine environment and nests in large trees
in coniferous forest along the coast. 



Proposed critical habitat units are located on Federal lands. This proposed critical habitat designation would
result in additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that are funded,
authorized, or carried out by Federal agencies. Section 4 of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat
on the basis of the best scientific information available and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts
of including particular areas in the designation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Previous Federal Action



On January 15, 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition to list the marbled murrelet
(

Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus

) in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended
(Act). On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40479), the Service published a finding that the petition had presented substantial
information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Because of the increased research effort and
new information available, the status review period was reopened, with the concurrence of the petitioners, from
March 5, 1990, through May 31, 1990 (55 FR 4913). 

On June 20, 1991 (56 FR 28362), the Service published a proposal to list the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon,
and California as a threatened species. The comment period was reopened for 30 days on January 30, 1992 (57 FR 3804),
to gather the most updated information on the species. Following a court order by the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington denying a 6-month extension, the Service published the final rule listing the marbled murrelet
in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species on October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45328). 

On November 2, 1993, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted a motion by the plaintiffs
in 

Marbled Murrelet 

v. 

Babbitt 

to compel a proposed designation of critical habitat. In the ruling, the court ordered the Secretary to propose designating
critical habitat for the marbled murrelet no later than January 21, 1994, and to make a final designation of critical
habitat as soon as reasonably possible under applicable law. 



Ecological Considerations



The marbled murrelet (

Brachyramphus marmoratus

) is a small seabird of the Alcidae family. The North American subspecies (

Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus

) ranges from the Aleutian Archipelago in Alaska eastward to Cook Inlet, Kodiak Island, Kenai Peninsula, and Prince
William Sound, south along the coast through the Alexander Archipelago of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington,
and Oregon to central California. Some wintering birds are found in southern California. A separate subspecies (

Brachyramphus marmoratus perdix

) occurs in Asia.

Marbled murrelets spend the majority of their lives at sea, where they feed primarily on small fish and invertebrates
in near-shore marine waters. Marbled murrelets nest inland, predominately in older, large-limbed trees in dense
forest. Marbled murrelets have been found occasionally on rivers and inland lakes (Carter and Sealy 1986). 

The marbled murrelet is a social species that is semi-colonial around the breeding site. Two nests discovered in Washington
during 1990 were located within 46 meters (150 feet) of each other (Hamer and Cummins 1990), and detections of marbled
murrelets exhibiting behaviors associated with nesting activity are often aggregated. 

Nesting occurs over an extended period from early April to late September (Carter and Sealy 1987). Marbled murrelets
have been observed at some inland sites during all months of the year (Paton 

et al. 

1987, Naslund 1993). During the breeding period, adult marbled murrelets lay a single egg in a tree containing structures
suitable for nesting (e.g., limbs at least 13 centimeters (cm) (5 inches) in diameter, mistletoe infections, witches
brooms, deformities). Both sexes incubate the egg in alternating 24-hour shifts for approximately 30 days, and the
young fledge after an additional 28 days (Simons 1980, Hirsch 

et al. 

1981, Singer 

et al. 

1991). Inland flights by adults feeding young are made from ocean feeding areas to nest sites at all times of the day,
but most often at dusk and dawn (Hamer and Cummins 1991). Chicks are fed at least once a day. The adults carry only one
fish at a time to the young (Carter and Sealy 1987; Hamer and Cummins 1991; Singer 

et al. 

1992; Nelson, Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, 

pers. comm. 

1992). The young are altricial, but remain in the nest longer than young of most other alcids. Before leaving the nest,
the young molt into a distinctive juvenile plumage. Fledglings fly directly from the nest to the sea rather than exploring
the forest environment first (Hamer and Cummins 1991). 

For the purpose of proposing critical habitat, the Service has concentrated on two components of marbled murrelet
habitat: (1) Nesting habitat; and (2) habitat needed to support foraging. Forest stands with conditions that will
support nesting marbled murrelets are referred to as ``suitable nesting habitat.'' 

Throughout the forested portion of the species' range, marbled murrelets nest near the marine environment in forest
stands containing characteristics of older forests (Binford 

et al. 

1975; Sealy and Carter 1984; Carter and Sealy 1987; Carter and Erickson 1988; Marshall 1988; Paton and Ralph 1988;
Nelson 1989; Burger, University of Victoria, 

in litt. 

1990; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Quinlan and Hughes 1990; Kuletz 1991; Nelson 

in litt. 

1991; Singer 

et al. 

1991, 1992; Nelson 1992; Nelson 

et al. 

1992). 

Historically, nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet was widely dispersed, particularly in the wetter portions
of its range in Washington, Oregon, and California. This habitat was generally found in very large, contiguous blocks.


Currently, the threatened population of marbled murrelets nests in most of the major types of coniferous forests
in the western portions of Washington, Oregon, and north-central California, wherever older forests remain in close
proximity to the coast. Habitat in the drier parts of the listed species' range (portions of southern Oregon and northern
California) is less continuous, occurring naturally in a mosaic pattern. Although marbled murrelet nesting habitat
is somewhat variable over the range of the species, some general habitat attributes are common throughout its range,
including nesting structure, canopy closure, stand size, tree species, landscape condition, and distance from
the marine environment. 

Individual tree attributes that provide conditions suitable for nesting include branches at least 13 cm (5 inches)
in diameter, deformities (e.g., broken tops), mistletoe infections, witches brooms, or other structures providing
a platform for nesting (Carter and Sealy 1987; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Singer 

et al. 

1991, 1992; Ralph 

et al. 

1993). These structures are typically found in old-growth and mature stands, but may be found in a variety of stand
types including younger stands containing remnant large trees. 

Sixty-one tree nests have been located in North America, including 35 in the range of the listed population (6 in Washington,
20 in Oregon, and 9 in California) (Binford 

et al. 

1975; Varoujean 

et al. 

1989; Burger 1990; Quinlan and Hughes 1990; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Kuletz 1991; Singer 

et al. 

1991, 1992; Nelson unpubl. data). All nests in Washington, Oregon, and California were located in old-growth trees
that were greater than 81 cm (32 inches) diameter at breast height (dbh). Most nests have been located on large or deformed
branches with a moss covering; however, a few nests have been located on smaller branches, and some nests were situated
on conifer needles or sticks rather than moss.

Canopy closure over the nest site provides protection from predation and weather. Such canopy closure may be provided
by trees adjacent to the nest tree and/or by the nest tree itself. Nests are typically located high above ground and
usually have good overhead protection. Such locations allow easy access and provide shelter from potential predators
and weather. 

Although a few nests have been located in relatively small stands, most nests have been found in larger stands with
sufficient internal structure to minimize the risk of predation at the nest (i.e., minimize habitat for species known
to prey on marbled murrelets) and provide suitable climatic conditions for nesting (Nelson 

in litt. 

1992). Marbled murrelets are more commonly encountered in larger stands of older forests in California (greater
than 202 hectares (500 acres)) than in smaller stands (less than 40 hectares (100 acres)). However, marbled murrelets
have been detected in smaller isolated stands in Oregon, with one confirmed nest in a 3-hectare (8-acre) stand (Nelson
unpubl. data). 

General landscape condition also may affect use of suitable nesting habitat. In Washington, marbled murrelet detections
increased when old-growth/mature forests comprised over 30 percent of the landscape. Hamer and Cummins (1990) found
that detections of marbled murrelets decreased in Washington when the percent of clearcut/meadow on the landscape
increased above 25 percent. 

Nests have been located in stands dominated by coastal redwood (

Sequoia sempervirens

), Douglas-fir (

Pseudotsuga menziesii

), mountain hemlock (

Tsuga mertensiana

), Sitka spruce (

Picea sitchensis

), western hemlock (

Tsuga heterophylla

), and western red-cedar (

Thuja plicata

) (Binford 

et al.

 1975; Quinlan and Hughes 1990; Hamer and Cummins 1991; Singer 

et al.

 1991, 1992; Nelson 

et al.

 in prep). The nests themselves have been located in Douglas-fir, coastal redwood, western hemlock, western red-cedar,
and Sitka spruce trees. These species of trees have growth forms that produce nesting opportunities and are susceptible
to damage (disease, breakage, wind damage) that may produce nesting structure. 

Critical habitat units should occur at a distance from the marine environment consistent with the flight and energetic
capabilities of marbled murrelets. The farthest inland known occupied site is 84 kilometers (52 miles) in Washington.
The farthest inland known detections in Oregon and California are 61 and 56 kilometers (38 and 35 miles), respectively.
Occupied sites are defined as forest stands where marbled murrelets have been observed exhibiting behaviors indicative
of likely nesting activity. 

Northwestern forests typically require 200 to 250 years to attain the attributes necessary to support marbled murrelet
nesting, though characteristics of nesting habitat are sometimes developed in younger redwood forests. Forests
with old-age remnant trees remaining from earlier stands may also develop into nesting habitat more quickly than
those without. These remnant attributes are products of fire, wind storms, or previous logging operations that did
not remove all of the trees. Other factors that may affect the time required to develop suitable nesting characteristics
include site productivity and aspects of the site microclimate. 

It is difficult to locate actual nests for a species such as the marbled murrelet, which may only show activity near
the nest once per day and under low light conditions. Therefore, identification of occupied sites and suitable habitat
are the best indicators of potential nest sites. Active nests, egg shell fragments, or young found on the forest floor,
birds seen flying through the forest beneath the canopy or landing in trees, birds seen circling above the canopy,
birds heard calling from a stationary perch, or large numbers of birds heard calling from within and around a stand
are all strong indicators of occupied habitat. Their semi-colonial nature makes marbled murrelets easier to detect
at high-use sites, though some areas (e.g., highly fragmented habitat with small stand size) support low numbers
of reproducing pairs, making detection difficult. 

Breeding populations of marbled murrelets are not distributed continuously throughout the species' range. In California,
there are three separate areas where marbled murrelets concentrate at sea, corresponding to the three largest remaining
blocks of coastal old-growth forest inland. These are separated by areas of little or no habitat where few marbled
murrelets are found at sea. 

A large break in the breeding distribution is located at the southern portion of the range in California, where approximately
480 kilometers (300 miles) separate the southern breeding population in San Mateo County from the next known occupied
site to the north in Humboldt County. This reach contained marbled murrelets prior to extensive logging in the area
(Paton and Ralph 1988). Another distribution gap is located between Tillamook County in Oregon and the Olympic Peninsula
in Washington, where few birds and occupied sites are known. The degree of interaction that occurs across these gaps
in distribution is unknown.

Very little habitat remains at low elevations in the Puget Trough area of Washington. Lands surrounding the Puget
Trough, particularly to the east and south, are highly urbanized or developed for agricultural use, forcing marbled
murrelets to fly up to 25 miles inland to reach the first available suitable nesting habitat. 

Although marbled murrelets have been heard and/or seen at some inland sites during most months of the year (Paton 

et al.

 1987, Naslund 1993), detectability at inland sites increases during the spring and reaches a peak late in summer coincident
with the peak in breeding activity (Paton and Ralph 1988, Nelson 1989). In early fall, the number of inland detections
decreases markedly, presumably because birds have completed breeding and are undergoing a flightless molt at sea.
It is unknown why marbled murrelets visit inland sites during the non-breeding season. Researchers hypothesize
that birds attending these areas in fall and winter may be experienced resident birds and that these visits may aid
in maintaining nest sites, nesting territories, and pair bonds (Naslund 1993). 

Marbled murrelets are currently experiencing very low recruitment rates. Juvenile to adult ratios of marbled murrelets
are between 0.012 and 0.035 (i.e., there are between 1 and 4 juvenile fledglings of that year observed for every 100
adults observed) (Strong 

et al.

 1993). These results are supported by survey data collected at points along the central coast of Oregon during 1988,
1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. The average percentage of juveniles in these counts were approximately 1, 4, 2, 5, and 1
percent, respectively (Nelson and Hardin in prep.). Surveys conducted in California have indicated similar juvenile
to adult ratios since 1989 (Ralph, U.S. Forest Service, Redwood Sciences Lab, 

pers. comm.

 1992). If the juvenile to adult ratios observed in the marine environment are accurate, then only 1 to 5 percent of the
observed population is successfully reproducing, that is, successfully fledging young. 

Average annual adult survival for stable populations of several other alcid species is approximately 90 percent
(Hudson 1985). Alcids typically experience their highest rates of mortality prior to the attainment of breeding
age. The average survival to breeding age for alcids is 29 percent (Hudson 1985). The combination of low fledging rates
of marbled murrelets, as demonstrated by the juvenile to adult ratios, and low survival to breeding age are likely
to produce recruitment rates far below those required to maintain present population levels. 

Based upon the longevity of other alcids (Hudson 1985), marbled murrelets are estimated to live an average of 10 years.
With such long-lived species, recruitment rates are a more accurate indicator of species condition than population
counts. At-sea counts of adult marbled murrelets may reflect a large portion of non-breeders that will not contribute
to the future population. If the current low recruitment rates are the result of recent losses of nesting opportunities,
counts of adults may not reflect the sustainable population until the population adjusts to remaining nesting habitat.

Another possible explanation for the low juvenile to adult ratios is that individuals are attempting to reproduce,
but the young of these birds are experiencing high mortality rates prior to reaching the ocean. Predation at marbled
murrelet nest sites may have significant impacts on the population. Predation by corvids (common crows (

Corvus brachyrhynchos

), ravens (

Corvus corax

), and Steller's jays (

Cyanocitta stelleri

)), great horned owls (

Bubo virginianus

), and sharp-shinned hawks (

Accipiter striatus

) have been identified as causes of marbled murrelet nest failure. From 1974 through 1991, approximately 71 percent
of all known marbled murrelet nests in the Pacific Northwest failed; 70 percent of these failed due to predation by
these species (Nelson 

in litt. 

1992). 

Corvids are often considered ``edge species'' that have been found to increase in numbers with increased forest fragmentation
(Andren 

et al. 

1985, Wilcove 1985, Small and Hunter 1988). Similar findings have been reported in central Oregon regarding great
horned owls (Johnson 1993). In addition, corvid predation on small bird nests is known to increase with increased
forest fragmentation and/or decreased distance of nests from a forest edge (Gates and Gysel 1978, Andren 

et al. 

1985, Small and Hunter 1988, Yahner and Scott 1988). The marbled murrelet's main defense against predation is camouflage.
The ability to successfully hide from arboreal predators is likely related to the number of nesting (or hiding) opportunities
available. Timber harvest reduces the number of nesting opportunities through the removal of nesting habitat within
the landscape, thus reducing the area predators must search. 

In addition to effects on marbled murrelet nesting habitat, the species is affected by impacts and threats to their
marine foraging habitat and food supply, as well as direct mortality from human activities such as oil spills and gill
netting. Attributes of foraging habitat include distance from shore, prey populations, and potential disturbances.


Marbled murrelets are typically distributed in the marine environment in a manner that roughly corresponds to the
location of concentrations of inland nesting habitat. Marbled murrelets generally forage in near-shore marine
waters. 

Marine systems producing sufficient prey to support a stable or growing population of marbled murrelets are important
foraging habitat for the species. Marbled murrelets have been reported feeding on a variety of small fish and invertebrates,
including Pacific herring (

Clupea harengus

), Pacific sandlance (

Ammodytes hexapterus

), northern anchovy (

Engraulis mordax

), capelin (

Mallotus villosus

), smelt, euphids, 

(Eupahsia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera) 

and mysids (Sealy 1975, Sanger and Jones 1981, Sanger 1987, Carter and Sealy 1990, Strong 

et al.

 1993). 

Mortality in the marine environment, primarily associated with oil spills and net fisheries in Washington, adversely
affects marbled murrelets. The impact of this loss is generally thought to be less than impacts to nesting habitat.
Protection of foraging areas from disturbance such as oil spills, net fisheries, and pollution would benefit marbled
murrelets. 



Management Considerations 



Marbled murrelets are found in forest stands containing a variety of forest structures, which are, in part, the result
of varied management practices. In many areas, management practices have resulted in fragmentation of the remaining
older forests and creation of large areas of younger forests that have yet to develop habitat characteristics suitable
for marbled murrelet nesting. Past forest management practices have also resulted in a forest age distribution unnaturally
skewed toward younger-aged stands. 

In many portions of the range of the marbled murrelet, forest management has historically concentrated on clearcut
logging. After forests are clearcut, the areas are traditionally replanted to a single or few tree species and maintained
as even-aged stands for maximum wood-fiber production. Site-preparation and management activities may further
decrease species diversity. These methods include prescribed burning and the use of herbicides or mechanical methods
to control competing vegetation. 

Historical logging practices in some portions of the species' range consisted of more selective timber harvesting,
leaving remnant patches of forests of varying ages with older forest characteristics. The uneven-age management
practices used in these areas usually resulted in more diverse stands, but with few trees containing suitable marbled
murrelet nesting structure. These areas may contain low concentrations of reproducing marbled murrelets, which
are difficult to locate. 

Current and historic marbled murrelet habitat loss is generally attributed to timber harvest and land conversion
practices, although natural disturbances such as forest fires have caused losses as well. Reduction of the remaining
older forest has not been evenly distributed over western Washington, Oregon, and California. Harvest has been concentrated
at the lower elevations and in the Coast Ranges (Thomas 

et al. 

1990), generally equating with the range of the marbled murrelet.

Habitat for marbled murrelets has been declining since the arrival of European settlers. Information specific to
the range of the marbled murrelet is not available; however, historic forest condition has been estimated for western
Oregon and Washington by several authors. Because marbled murrelet habitat represents a significant portion of
area included in these estimates, trends in habitat are assumed to follow the same general pattern. Although the extent
of mature and old-growth forest before the 1800s is difficult to quantify, western Oregon and Washington are estimated
to have been covered by approximately 9.7 to 11.3 million hectares (24 to 28 million acres) of forest at the time of modern
settlement (early to mid-1800s), of which about 70 percent (5.6 to 7.7 million hectares (14 to 19 million acres)) are
estimated to have been old-growth (Society of American Foresters Task Force 1983, Morrison 1988, Norse 1988, Spies
and Franklin 1988). Historical estimates for northwestern California are not as precise but suggest there were between
526,000 and 1.3 million hectares (1.3 and 3.2 million acres) of old-growth Douglas-fir/mixed conifer forest and
approximately 890,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) of old-growth coastal redwood forest (Society of American Foresters
Task Force 1983, Laudenslayer 1985, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 1988, Fox 1988, Morrison
1988). Currently, there are approximately 1.4 million hectares (3.4 million acres) of old-growth forest remaining
in western Oregon and Washington, an 82 percent reduction from estimated prelogging levels (Booth 1991). 

Some of the old-growth areas that have been affected by past natural perturbations such as forest fire and windthrow
currently provide suitable nesting habitat for marbled murrelets. Mature forests that have naturally regenerated
from such perturbations often retain scattered old-growth trees and clumps, providing structure for nesting. This
is particularly true in coastal Oregon where there were extensive fires historically. Marbled murrelet nests have
been found in remnant old-growth trees in mature forests in Oregon; no occupied sites have been located in young stands,
clearcuts, or young forests that lack at least some remnant old-growth trees (Nelson 

pers. comm. 

1992). 

Forests generally require 200 to 250 years to develop old-growth characteristics that supply adequate structure
for nesting marbled murrelets. This time period may be shorter in redwood forests and in areas where significant remnants
of the previous stand remain. Intensively managed forests in Washington, Oregon, and California have been subjected
to average cutting rotations of 70 to 120 years (USDI 1984, USDA 1988). Cutting rotations of 40 to 50 years are common
for some private lands. Timber harvest strategies on Federal lands and some private lands have emphasized dispersed
clearcut patches and even-aged management. Thus, forest lands that are intensively managed for timber production
are generally not allowed to develop the old-growth characteristics that are required for marbled murrelet nesting.
Suitable nesting habitat that remains under these harvest patterns is highly fragmented. 



Previous Management Efforts 



Since the listing of the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California as threatened, several different
approaches to management of the species or its habitat have been developed through various Federal efforts. 

In May 1991, the U.S. House of Representatives' Agriculture and Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committees commissioned
the Scientific Panel on Late-Successional Forest Ecosystems (Scientific Panel) to provide an array of alternatives
for the management of late-successional forests on Federal lands within the range of the northern spotted owl (

Strix occidentalis caurina

). Information on the known inland locations of marbled murrelets and marbled murrelet habitat was included in the
base information used by the Scientific Panel and was specifically considered in developing the alternatives. These
reserve systems are often referred to as Late-Successional/Old-Growth areas (LSOGs). The Scientific Panel conducted
risk assessments for marbled murrelets under each alternative (Johnson 

et al. 

1991).

<TEXT>
 

In 1993, the Forest Service released its Scientific Analysis Team Report (Thomas 

et al.

 1993). In this report, the Forest Service proposed several interim measures designed to preserve options for management
of marbled murrelets and their habitat until the Marbled Murrelet Recovery Plan could be completed and implemented.
These measures include: (1) The protection of all marbled murrelet nesting habitat within 35 miles of the marine environment
in California and Oregon south of State Highway 42, and within 50 miles of the marine environment in the remainder of
Oregon and in Washington; and, (2) the protection of amounts of ``recruitment'' habitat (young stands likely to develop
into suitable habitat) equivalent to 50 percent of the total amount of existing suitable habitat in the above mentioned
zones. Also, seasonal restrictions on operations in and near suitable habitat were identified to avoid disturbing
nesting marbled murrelets. 

In July 1993, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, National
Marine Fisheries Service, and Environmental Protection Agency released the Report of the Forest Ecosystem Management
Assessment Team (FEMAT Report) (USDA 

et al.

 1993a). From this report, the President identified Option 9 as the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan, described in the
Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth
Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (DSEIS) as Alternative 9 (Alternative 9) (USDA


et al.

 1993b). Within the range of the marbled murrelet, Alternative 9 would designate a system of Late-Successional Reserves,
which provides large areas expected to eventually develop into contiguous, unfragmented forest. This reserve system
was constructed in part around the LSOGs designated by the Scientific Panel. In addition, specific measures were
included to protect all forest sites occupied by marbled murrelets outside the reserve system. These measures include
surveys prior to activities that affect habitat and protection of contiguous marbled murrelet nesting and recruitment
habitat (stands capable of becoming suitable within 25 years) within 0.5 mile of areas occupied by murrelets. 

The Service recognizes the value of the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan (USDA 

et al.

 1993a) and acknowledges that it can play an integral role in marbled murrelet conservation. The Plan complements
this critical habitat proposal by stressing the need for protection of large, unfragmented areas of suitable nesting
habitat that are well-distributed throughout the species' range, with special emphasis on areas close to the marine
environment.

Critical Habitat 



Definition of Critical Habitat 



Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species * * * on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential
to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and
(ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed * * *
upon a determination * * * that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.''
The term ``conservation,'' as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``* * * to use and the
use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the
point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary * * *.'' 



Role in Species Conservation 



The use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should
identify lands that may be needed for a species' eventual recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat
is designated at the time a species is listed or before a recovery plan is completed, the Service frequently does not
know all the habitat areas that may be essential for a species' recovery. In this regard, critical habitat serves to
preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. 

The designation of critical habitat is one of several measures available to contribute to the conservation of a listed
species. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying areas that contain essential habitat
features (primary constituent elements), regardless of whether or not they are currently occupied by the listed
species, thus alerting the public to the importance of an area in the species' conservation. Critical habitat also
identifies areas that may require special management or protection. The added emphasis on these areas for conservation
of the species may shorten the time needed to achieve recovery. 

Critical habitat receives consideration under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions carried out, authorized,
or funded by a Federal agency. Federal agencies must ensure that their actions do not result in destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat. Aside from this added consideration under section 7, the Act does not provide any
additional protection to lands designated as critical habitat. Designating critical habitat does not create a management
plan for the areas, establish numerical population goals or prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside
of critical habitat), or have a direct effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management recommendations
for critical habitat are addressed in recovery plans, management plans, and in section 7 consultations. 



Primary Constituent Elements 



A designation of critical habitat begins by identifying areas on which are found the physical and biological features
essential to conservation of a species. In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service
considers those physical and biological features that are essential to a species' conservation and that may require
special management considerations or protection. Such physical and biological features, as stated in 50 CFR 424.12,
include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; 

(2) Food, water, air, light, minerals or other nutritional or physiological requirements; 

(3) Cover or shelter; 

(4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and

(5) Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological
distributions of a species. 

The Service is required to base critical habitat designations upon the best scientific data available (50 CFR 424.12).
In proposing to designate critical habitat for the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California, the Service
has reviewed its overall approach to the conservation of the species. For a thorough discussion of the ecology and
life history of the marbled murrelet, see the Service's Biological Report (Marshall 1988), the final rule listing
the Washington, Oregon, and California population (57 FR 45328) of this subspecies, and the Ecological Considerations
section of this rule. 

Within habitat areas essential for marbled murrelet nesting, the Service has focused on the following primary constituent
elements: (1) Individual trees with potential nesting platforms; (2) forest stands surrounding potential nest
trees, including contiguous forest with similar average height and canopy closure; (3) forest stands with high crown
cover and sufficient height to contribute to a forest landscape with decreased fragmentation; and (4) forest stands
within the potential flight distance of marbled murrelets from the marine environment where the birds feed. These
primary constituent elements are essential to provide nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet. 

Individual nest trees include large trees, generally over 81 cm (32 inches) dbh, with the presence of potential nest
platforms or deformities such as large limbs (greater than 13 cm (5 inches)), broken tops, mistletoe infections,
witches brooms, or other formations providing a broad platform. Because marbled murrelets do not build nests, moss
or detritus to cushion or hold the egg may be important. Platforms should have overhead cover for protection from predators
and weather, which may be provided by overhanging branches, limbs above the nest area, or branches from neighboring
trees. Based on current information, Douglas-fir, coastal redwood, western hemlock, western red-cedar, or Sitka
spruce are the trees most likely to provide suitable nesting structure. 

Nesting habitat includes the forest stand in which the nest trees are contained. Nest stands are defined as contiguous
mature and old-growth forest with no separations of greater than 100 meters (330 feet) wide. Nest trees may be scattered
throughout the stand or clumped within portions of the contiguous stand. Nest stands in mature forest may contain
fewer than one old-growth tree per acre. Regardless of the distribution of nest trees, nesting habitat includes the
entire contiguous forest stand with similar height and canopy closure. The forest stand surrounding the nest tree
provides protection from predators and climatic factors. 

On a landscape basis, the presence of late-successional, mature, and old-growth forests with substantial canopy
closure and canopy height of at least one-half the site-potential tree height also contribute to the conservation
of the marbled murrelet, even if they do not contain potential nest trees. The site-potential tree height is the average
maximum height possible for a tree given the local growing conditions. The presence of these forest stands increases
the area predators must search, decreasing predator efficiency. Forests of the general height of the nest stands
and in close proximity to the stand reduce edge-associated predation, effects of changes in microclimate associated
with abrupt edges, and potential for windthrow during storms. 

To be considered as nesting habitat, forest stands must occur at a distance from the marine environment consistent
with the flight and energetic capabilities of the marbled murrelet. Based on confirmed detections of marbled murrelets,
this distance varies from 84 kilometers (52 miles) in Washington to less than 16 kilometers (10 miles) in parts of California.
Flight distances may reflect the energetic capabilities of marbled murrelets and the presence of suitable nesting
habitat.

The Service is not proposing to designate marine areas as critical habitat for the marbled murrelet at this time, but
will continue to collect information on threats, the need for marine critical habitat, and the potential benefits
of designating marine critical habitat. 



Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat 



Several qualitative criteria were considered in the selection of specific areas as critical habitat. These criteria
are generally similar to criteria used in the development of several recent Federal management proposals, such as
the report prepared by the Scientific Panel (Johnson 

et al. 

1991) and Alternative 9 (USDA 

et al.

 1993a). The following is a description of the criteria considered: 

Known Occupied Sites: Proposed critical habitat units include the majority of the known sites occupied by marbled
murrelets on Federal lands. However, known occupied sites may represent only a small portion of the population due
to the limited coverage of past survey efforts. 

Suitable Nesting Habitat: Proposed critical habitat units include areas with current suitable nesting habitat
and other primary constituent elements. Approximately 48 percent of the suitable nesting habitat on Federal lands
within the range of the species in Washington, Oregon, and California is included in proposed critical habitat. Forests
that are not currently suitable, but which are of similar average height and canopy closure, are also important in
improving habitat conditions through reduced fragmentation and creation of large contiguous forest stands that
reduce the potential for predation. The total amount of land containing the other primary constituent elements is
currently unknown. 

Distance from Marine Environment: Marbled murrelets forage daily in the marine environment during the nesting season.
To allow for foraging opportunities, nesting habitat must be within the flight capabilities and energetic limits
of the species. Proposed critical habitat units were selected based on the distance inland of detections in each general
area. As stated above, detections range from over 50 miles from the marine environment in Washington to less than 10
miles in some portions of California. 

Rangewide Distribution: To reduce the impact of catastrophic losses of habitat or birds and maintain the current
distribution of the species, proposed critical habitat units were selected throughout the range of the listed population,
where Federal lands were available. With well-distributed critical habitat, the probability of substantial population
declines resulting from catastrophic wildfires or storm events is reduced. Maintaining nesting habitat, and therefore
local concentrations, throughout the range of the species will reduce potential losses from oil spills or other marine
events. Given the intense site fidelity of most alcid species, maintaining rangewide distribution may also provide
potential source populations for the recolonization of future habitat. 

Large, Contiguous Blocks of Habitat: In response to the problems of fragmentation of suitable habitat, potential
increases in predation, and reduced reproductive success, the Service concentrated on selecting proposed critical
habitat units in terms of large, contiguous blocks of late-successional, mature, and old-growth forest. To provide
large blocks of habitat, the Service concentrated on the Late-Successional Reserve system identified in Alternative
9. Marbled murrelet locations and habitat were considered in the development of these reserves. Where large blocks
of Federal reserve areas were not available, but where critical habitat was determined to be important for distribution,
smaller Federal reserves were included. 

Adequacy of Existing Protection and Management: The Service considered the existing legal status of lands in the
decision to propose specific areas as critical habitat. Areas with permanent legal protection, such as congressionally-designated
wilderness areas, national parks, and national wildlife refuges, are not proposed. 



Results of Applying Criteria 



Application of the selection criteria resulted in the proposed designation of many of the Late-Successional Reserves,
as described in Alternative 9, on Federal lands within the range of the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and
California. 

At this time, only Federal lands are proposed for designation. However, the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment
Team recognized the limited ability of Federal agencies to recover this species on Federal lands. ``Although the
Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment was designed to address only Federal lands within the range of the northern
spotted owl, the marbled murrelet is an example of a species whose life history requirements cannot be accommodated
only on Federal lands. The marbled murrelet is a seabird that nests inland and therefore is influenced by both the marine
and terrestrial environments. Its nesting range in the three-state area includes land that is south of the range of
the northern spotted owl. In addition, several areas that are considered key to the recovery of the marbled murrelet
involve private and State lands'' (FEMAT Report at IV-151 and IV-152, USDA 

et al. 

1993a). For example, the southernmost portion of the range of the marbled murrelet in California, southwest Washington,
and northwest Oregon contain little or no Federal lands or habitat capable of supporting marbled murrelets. The Service
currently lacks sufficient information to fully identify any specific non-Federal lands essential to the conservation
of the species in these and other areas. The Service will continue to gather information on non-Federal land contributions
to conservation and through this notice is requesting comments on this subject. 



Lands Not Proposed 



Not all suitable nesting habitat is included within the proposed critical habitat units. Emphasis has been placed
on those areas considered most essential to the species in terms of habitat, distribution, and ownership. That does
not mean that lands outside critical habitat are not important to the marbled murrelet. Some Federal lands outside
of critical habitat are expected to receive additional protection from the conservation measures proposed in Alternative
9. Some habitat on non-Federal lands receives protection through prohibitions against take of marbled murrelets.

Congressionally-protected Areas 



Because they are generally managed as natural ecosystems, congressionally-designated wilderness areas and national
parks are expected to protect marbled murrelet habitat from alteration. These areas are not proposed for designation
as critical habitat because the management goals are generally adequate to conserve the species. However, not all
congressional designations are managed in this manner. For example, national recreation areas may not be managed
to maintain older forest habitats. In addition, some national parks and wilderness areas are experiencing internal
and external threats (e.g., highway realignments) to marbled murrelet habitat. The Service is continuing to gather
information on management goals and potential threats to these types of areas. 

Congressionally-protected areas (e.g., wilderness areas and national parks) are rare within the range of the marbled
murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California. Few wilderness areas lie within the flight distance of marbled murrelets
from the marine environment, though some of these areas provide crucial contributions to the conservation of the
species. A substantial portion of these areas are incapable of producing marbled murrelet nesting habitat because
of forest composition, lack of forest cover, elevation, and other constraints. Therefore, by themselves, congressionally-protected
areas are incapable of supporting stable and interactive populations of marbled murrelets. 

Wilderness areas and national parks contain approximately 302,000 hectares (747,000 acres) of marbled murrelet
nesting habitat, representing 29 percent of the suitable nesting habitat on Federal lands within the range of the
marbled murrelet. They contain 46 (8 percent) of the known occupied sites on Federal lands. 



Effects of Proposed Designation 



This proposal for designation of critical habitat for the marbled murrelet identifies 62 proposed critical habitat
units encompassing approximately 1,217,000 hectares (3,005,000 acres) of Federal land based on information available
in the Interagency Geographical Information System (GIS) and FEMAT Report (USDA 

et al. 

1993a). The Service has identified 28 proposed critical habitat units totaling 471,000 hectares (1,162,000 acres)
of Federal land in Washington, 20 proposed critical habitat units totaling 560,000 hectares (1,382,000 acres) of
Federal land in Oregon, and 14 proposed critical habitat units totaling 186,000 hectares (460,000 acres) of Federal
land in California. State, private, tribal, and other non-Federal lands are not proposed as critical habitat at this
time even if they are physically located within the boundaries of a proposed critical habitat unit, and acreage of
non-Federal lands is not included in the above figures. 

Some small areas of naturally-occurring or human-created non-suitable habitat (i.e., areas that have never been
nor will likely ever be marbled murrelet nesting habitat, such as alpine areas, water bodies, serpentine meadows,
airports, roads, buildings, and parking lots) are located within the physical boundaries of proposed critical habitat
units. Where possible, these areas were not included within the proposed critical habitat boundaries, and acreage
totals were adjusted to reflect the exclusion of this non-suitable habitat. However, many of these areas are small
and could not be physically identified on the GIS maps. Also, current mapping information does not allow precise identification
of the location of primary constituent elements. The Service is continuing to gather information to refine the boundaries
of critical habitat units to eliminate areas that do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements or
will remain non-suitable. 

Efforts by Federal agencies to survey for marbled murrelets have been concentrated in areas of proposed timber sales
or limited research locations. Only a small fraction of the suitable nesting habitat has been surveyed to date, and
surveys have not been uniformly spread across the range of the species. Therefore, known occupied sites provide only
a partial indication of the actual areas used by the species. The proposed critical habitat includes 449 (78 percent)
of the 574 known occupied sites on Federal lands. Congressionally-protected areas include 48 additional occupied
sites. Congressionally-protected areas were not included in critical habitat because management is expected to
be consistent with the conservation of the marbled murrelet. 

The Service does not have specific information on the amount of suitable nesting habitat or habitat containing one
or more of the primary constituent elements on non-Federal lands within the species' range, though it is aware through
the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team databases of approximately 189 known occupied sites on non-Federal
lands. The Service continues to seek information and comments on the location of suitable nesting habitat and occupied
sites on non-Federal lands.

Designation of critical habitat would not offer specific direction for managing marbled murrelet nesting habitat
nor provide a management or conservation plan for the species. Recovery plans typically provide guidance for conservation,
which may include population goals and the identification of areas that may need protection or special management.
Recovery plans usually include management recommendations for designated critical habitat. In February 1993,
the Service appointed a recovery team to develop a recovery plan for the marbled murrelet. The team plans to have a draft
recovery plan available in the spring of 1994. The Service will continue to work closely with the recovery team and
will reexamine proposed critical habitat in light of recovery team recommendations. 



Section 7_Consultation 



Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out
are not likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies,
and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions
are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. A Federal agency must consult with the
Service if its proposed action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Regulations implementing this interagency
cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. 

Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as ``* * * a direct
or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery
of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those
physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.'' The jeopardy concept
is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival
and recovery of a species. 

Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy, are directly related.
Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. The closer one is to recovery,
the greater the certainty in the species' continued survival. The terms survival and recovery are thus related by
the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a given period of time. Factors that influence a species'
persistence include population numbers, distribution throughout its range, stochasticity, expected duration,
and reproductive success. 

The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species'
conservation. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply
to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species, thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring
that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and recommendations of a recovery
plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery in the Act's definition of critical habitat, the
prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat should provide for the protection
of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to the recovery of the species. Thus, the adverse modification standard
may be reached closer to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas, the jeopardy standard has been applied
nearer to the extinction end of the continuum. 

After a proposal of critical habitat, section 7(a)(4) of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR 402.10) require
Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification
of the proposed critical habitat. Conference reports provide advisory conservation recommendations to assist
a Federal agency in identifying and resolving conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action.

If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, a formal conference report may be issued. A formal conference report
on proposed critical habitat contains an opinion that is prepared in accordance with 50 CFR 402.14 as if the critical
habitat were designated, not proposed. Such a formal conference report may be adopted as the biological opinion pursuant
to 50 CFR 402.10(d) when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information has been brought forward
and no changes in the action occur that would alter the content of the opinion. 



Examples of Proposed Actions 



Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief
description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may
be affected by such designation. As stated earlier, regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical
habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat
to be critical. 

A wide variety of existing and proposed activities may alter or affect proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat.
Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to timber harvest, forest management, salvage activities,
limbing or modification of limb structure (e.g., for hazard management), mining and mineral exploration, construction
of hydroelectric facilities, road construction and refurbishing, and development. Activities that do not alter
forest condition, such as some recreational use and personal-use commodity production (e.g., noncommercial mushroom
picking, Christmas tree cutting, rock collection) are unlikely to be affected by the proposed designation. 

Activities conducted according to the standards and guidelines for Late-Successional Reserves, as described in
Alternative 9 of the DSEIS for the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan would, in most cases, be unlikely to result in the
destruction or adverse modification of proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat. Activities in these areas would
be limited to manipulation of young forest stands that are not currently marbled murrelet nesting habitat. Also,
these manipulations would be conducted in a manner that would not slow the development of these areas into future nesting
habitat and should speed the development of some characteristics of older forest. 



Economic and Other Impacts 



The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and to
consider the economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary
may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits
of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial
data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species
concerned. The Act thus requires the Service to evaluate the economic and other effects likely to result from a designation
of critical habitat. Effects attributable to the listing of the species, normal changes in affected industries,
or changes in Federal land management that are not caused by the designation are not regarded as effects of the designation
of critical habitat. However, due to the complex interplay of economic and other forces, separating impacts associated
solely with the designation of critical habitat from other impacts is often difficult.

The proposed critical habitat units for the marbled murrelet coincide with the location of many of the Late-Successional
Reserves as described in Option 9 of the FEMAT Report (USDA 

et al. 

1993a) and Alternative 9 (USDA 

et al. 

1993b). Alternative 9 is identified as the preferred alternative in the DSEIS for the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan.
Based on the description of standards for management of and limitations on impacts to marbled murrelet habitat within
the Late-Successional Reserves, management of the Reserves under Alternative 9 would be consistent with designating
them as critical habitat for the marbled murrelet. Therefore, the economic effects of the designation of Late-Successional
Reserves as critical habitat are not likely to exceed those described in the economic analysis of the FEMAT Report
(Johnson 

et al. 

1993, USDA 

et al. 

1993a). 

The Service has preliminarily reviewed the possible economic impacts of designating critical habitat for the marbled
murrelet on ongoing timber activities. Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are currently under
court injunctions prohibiting the offering of any new sales until the agencies comply with the National Environmental
Policy Act and various forest management legislation. The Proposed Northwest Forest Plan will be presented to the
court by April 1994 in an attempt to resolve the court's concerns. Pending that court decision, the only timber available
to the timber industry from Federal lands are sold and awarded sales, particularly sales offered under the protection
of Section 318. Therefore, the Service proposes to exclude sold and awarded sales from any final critical habitat
designation due to economic impacts, both regionally and nationally, due to the limited amount of volume available
for Federal harvest. Comments are requested from the public on this aspect of the proposed rule. 

The time constraints governing this proposed critical habitat designation did not allow for a more detailed evaluation
on the particular areas proposed. Following receipt of comments and information during the public comment period,
the Service will conduct additional economic analyses if needed. The Service will further evaluate the economic
and other relevant impacts of including or excluding particular areas from a designation of marbled murrelet critical
habitat. 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned government agencies, Indian Nations, the scientific
community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule is hereby solicited. Comments
are particularly sought concerning: 

(1) The reasons why any Federal lands (either proposed critical habitat or additional areas) should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act, including adaptive management areas under
Alternative 9 of the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan; 

(2) The location and reasons why any non-Federal lands should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as
provided by section 4 of the Act, including potential threats and the value of any areas to the conservation of the species;

(3) The reasons why any marine areas should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section
4 of the Act, including information on potential threats, current activities, the effect of current regulatory mechanisms,

on congressionally-protected lands within the range of the marbled murrelet; 

(6) Current and planned activities within congressionally-protected areas that might affect, positively or negatively,
the conservation of the marbled murrelet, including any management plans or statutory mandates; 

(7) Other physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of the species and in need of special
management or protection; 

(8) Specific information on the amount, location, and distribution of suitable marbled murrelet nesting habitat
and the numbers and distribution of sites occupied by marbled murrelets on all ownerships and land designations;


(9) Information concerning health of the ecosystems on which the marbled murrelet depends; 

(10) Information on the economic benefits and costs that would result from the proposed designation of critical habitat
for the marbled murrelet, including the segments of the economy that would be affected by the proposed designation;


(11) Data and information relevant to determining whether the benefits of excluding a particular area from critical
habitat outweigh the benefits of specifying the area as critical habitat; 

(12) Methods of analysis useful in evaluating economic and other relevant impacts; and 

(13) Additional information that should be included in the analysis of economic and other impacts of the proposed
designation. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in conjunction with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act.
A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). 



Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior has determined that
the proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within proposed
critical habitat units, it is not clear at this time whether significant economic impacts will result from critical
habitat designation. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements
are imposed on small entities by this designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 



Takings Implications Assessment 



The Service has analyzed the potential takings implications of designating critical habitat for the marbled murrelet
in a Takings Implications Assessment prepared pursuant to requirements of Executive Order 12630, ``Governmental
Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' The Takings Implications Assessment
concludes that critical habitat designation, as proposed, would not pose significant takings implications.

<DOCTITLE>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of Finding on a Petition to Add Pinus albicaulis (Whitebark
Pine) to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species. </DOCTITLE>

ACTION:

 Notice of petition finding. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding for a petition to amend the List of Endangered
and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. The Service finds that the petitioners have not presented substantial information
indicating that listing 

Pinus albicaulis

 (whitebark pine) may be warranted. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

Background 



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), requires that
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species
presents substantial scientific or commercial information to demonstrate that the petitioned action may be warranted.
This finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time. To the maximum extent practicable,
this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in
the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is positive, the Service also is required to promptly commence a review of the status of the involved
species. 

The Service has made a 90-day finding on a petition to list 

Pinus albicaulis

 (whitebark pine). The petition, dated February 5, 1991, was submitted by the Great Bear Foundation, Missoula, Montana,
and was received by the Service on February 11, 1991. The petitioners requested that the Service list the whitebark
pine as endangered in western Montana, northern Idaho, western Wyoming, and northeastern Washington, and as either
threatened or endangered in the Cascade region of Oregon and Washington, and that critical habitat be designated.


Under the Act, the Service is required to address the status of plant species over their entire range (unlike vertebrate
species where distinct population segments may be listed). Therefore, the Service views the petition as a petition
to list the whitebark pine throughout its range, which extends from central California to western Wyoming, north
through Oregon, Washington, and Montana to Alberta and British Columbia.

The petitioner submitted information and literature references on the status of the whitebark pine, stating that
in significant portions of the species' range, populations are declining so rapidly that the ability of the tree species
to regenerate itself is in question. The petition identifies three major factors involved in the ``precipitous''
decline of the whitebark pine: white pine blister rust (

Cronartium ribicola

), mountain pine beetle (

Dendroctonus ponderosae

), and fire suppression. The petition indicates that white pine blister rust, an introduced disease, has become established
throughout most of the whitebark pine's range with ``extensive'' infestation and mortality occurring in the moist
mountain regions of Montana, northern Idaho, Oregon, and the Washington Cascades. The petition also states that
mountain pine beetle infestations have had devastating effects on whitebark pine populations in Montana and Wyoming.
The petitioner also points out that fire suppression has played a role in the population decline by allowing other
tree species to invade whitebark pine habitat and replace it, as well as facilitating the spread of white pine blister
rust and mountain pine beetle infestation. 

While recent mountain pine beetle infestations have killed most of the mature trees in some areas (Reynolds 1990),
infestations appear to reach epidemic levels only where specific conditions exist. Whitebark pine populations
have been severely reduced by white pine blister rust in many moist mountain habitats where the climate allows the
blister rust to complete its life cycle (Kendall and Arno 1990). However, in drier portions of the whitebark pine's
range, climatic conditions are not favorable for infection, and damage due to white pine blister rust is negligible
(Charles Wellner, retired U.S. Forest Service, 

in litt

., 1991). Thus, throughout portions of its range, the whitebark pine remains common in suitable habitats and/or populations
do not appear to be declining (Dr. Clinton Williams, U.S. Forest Service, 

in litt

., 1991; Chester Buchanan, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 

in litt

., 1991; R.T. Ogilvie, Royal British Columbia Museum, pers. comm., 1992). 

The Service has reviewed the petition, the literature cited in the petition, other available literature and information,
and has consulted with biologists and researchers familiar with the whitebark pine. After reviewing the best scientific
and commercial information available, the Service finds the petition does not present substantial information
that listing the whitebark pine may be warranted. In making this finding, the Service does recognize that white pine
blister rust, mountain pine beetle infestations, and successional replacement and competition by more shade-tolerant
conifers do pose a real threat to the whitebark pine in portions of its range. Some whitebark pine populations have
undergone dramatic declines due to one or a combination of these factors, and the degree of population decline may
be severe in local or, in some cases, over broad geographic areas. However, in other portions of the species' range,
where different climatic conditions exist, these same factors are not stand-threatening, and healthy whitebark
pine stands continue to persist. 

Whitebark pine is usually restricted to remote, higher elevation areas and generally is not valued as a timber species.
Consequently, little inventory or monitoring work has been completed in much of its range. In many areas, there are
little or no quantitative data on its distribution, status, or the extent of decline due to the various factors mentioned
above. However, available data do not indicate the species may be threatened or endangered throughout a significant
portion of its range. 

In regard to the petitioner's request that critical habitat be designated for the whitebark pine, the designation
of critical habitat is not a petitionable action under the Act.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposal to List the Spruce-Fir Moss Spider as an Endangered Species





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Service proposes to list the spruce-fir moss spider (

Microhexura montivaga

) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This spider is currently known
from four mostly small populations located in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. The spider's damp high-elevation
forest habitat is deteriorating rapidly due primarily to air pollution and exotic insects. The species' current
low numbers also increase its vulnerability to harm from other threats. Listing 

Microhexura montivaga 

as an endangered species would provide protection under the Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The spruce-fir moss spider was originally described by Crosby and Bishop (1925) based on collections made from a site
in western North Carolina in 1923 (Coyle 1981). Only a few specimens were taken, and little was known about the species
until its rediscovery approximately 50 years later by Dr. Frederick Coyle (Western Carolina University, Cullowhee,
North Carolina) and Dr. William Shear (Hampden-Sydney College, Hampden-Sydney, Virginia) (Coyle 1981). 

Microhexura montivaga 

is one of only two species belonging to the genus 

Microhexura 

in the family 

Dipluridae 

(Coyle 1981; Harp 1991, 1992). The other species in the genus, 

M. idahoana

, occurs only in the Pacific Northwest (Coyle 1981). Diplurids belong in the primitive suborder 

Mygalomorphae, 

which are often popularly referred to as ``tarantulas'' (Harp 1991, 1992). The genus 

Microhexura 

is the northernmost representative of the family 

Dipluridae 

and is also one of the smallest of the mygalomorph spiders, with adults measuring only 3.0 to 5.6 millimeters (roughly
1/4 to 7/16 inch) (Coyle 1981). Coloration of 

M. montivaga 

ranges from light brown to a darker reddish brown, and there are no markings on the abdomen (Harp 1992). The carapace
is generally yellowish brown (Harp 1992). The most reliable field identification characteristics for the spruce-fir
moss spider are a pair of very long posterior spinnerets and the presence of a second pair of book lungs, which appear
as light patches posterior to the genital furrow (Harp 1992). 

The typical habitat of the spruce-fir moss spider is found in well-drained moss (and liverwort) mats growing on rocks
or boulders, in well-shaded situations in mature, high-elevation Fraser fir (

Abies fraseri

) and red spruce (

Picea rubens

) forests (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). The moss mats cannot be too dry (the species is very sensitive to desiccation) or
too wet (large drops of water can also pose a threat to the spider) (Harp 1992). The spider constructs its tube-shaped
webs in the interface between the moss mat and rock surface (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992), though occasionally the web extends
into the interior of the moss mat (Harp 1992). The tubes are thin-walled and typically broad and flattened with short
side branches (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). There is no record of prey having been found in the webs of the spruce-fir moss
spider nor has the species been observed taking prey in the wild, but the abundant springtails (collembolans) in the
moss mats provide the most likely source of food for the spider (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). 

Males of the species mature during September and October, and females are known to lay eggs in June. The egg sac is thin-walled
and nearly transparent, and it may contain seven to nine eggs. The female remains with the egg sac and, if disturbed,
will carry the egg sac with her fangs. Spiderlings emerge in September (Coyle 1981). The means of dispersal of the spiderlings
from the parental moss mat is not known, but ``ballooning,'' a process by which the spiders use a sheet of silk played
out into the wind to carry them into the air, has been suggested as a possible means of long-range dispersal (Harp 1992).
The life span of the species is also unknown, but Coyle (1981) estimated that it may take 4 years for the species to reach
maturity.

From 1989 through 1992, status surveys were conducted for the spruce-fir moss spider (Harp 1991, 1992). Based on the
results of these surveys, the spider is presently known to exist at only four locations_three sites in North Carolina
and one in Tennessee. Of the four remaining populations, only one appears to be relatively stable. This population
is located along the Avery/Caldwell County line in North Carolina. The other two populations in North Carolina are
located in Swain County. Both of these Swain County populations are extremely small, with only one spruce-fir moss
spider having been found at each of these two sites in recent years (Harp 1991, 1992). The spruce-fir forests at these
two Swain County sites are rapidly declining. The Tennessee population is located in Sevier County. This population
was considered healthy in 1989 but is currently believed to be declining in numbers and is endangered by habitat loss/alteration
(Harp 1992). The high-elevation spruce-fir forests throughout much of the species' historic range are being decimated
by the balsam wooly adelgid (

Adelges piceae

), an exotic insect pest, and possibly by air pollution (acid precipitation) and other factors not yet fully understood.
The death and thinning of the forest canopy results in locally drastic changes in microclimate, including increased
temperatures and decreased moisture leading to desiccation of the moss mats on which the spruce-fir moss spider,
and possibly its prey base, depend for survival. 

The spruce-fir moss spider is not included in the Service's notice of review for animal candidates published in the


Federal Register

 of November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). However, because of concerns expressed by some individuals for the spider's status,
the Service contracted in 1990 for a survey of both historic and potential habitat of the species. The results of the
survey, which was completed in 1992, indicate that the spider is undergoing a rapid decline in distribution. Presently
only one relatively stable population is known to survive, and while currently considered to be healthy, this population
is potentially threatened by the same factors that are believed to have resulted in the decline and/or extirpation
of the species elsewhere within its historic range. 

Species appearing in the candidate notices of review are assigned to either category 1, 2 or 3. In conjunction with
the current proposed rule, the Service has approved the spruce-fir moss spider as a category 1 candidate. Category
1 represents those species for which the Service has enough substantial information on biological vulnerability
and threats to support proposals to list them as endangered or threatened species. 

The Service has met and been in contact with various Federal and State agency personnel and private individuals knowledgeable
about the species concerning its status and the need for the protection provided by the Act. On December 31, 1992, the
Service notified appropriate Federal, State, and local government agencies and landowners, in writing, that a status
review was being conducted and that the species might be proposed for Federal listing. A total of ten written comments
were received. The National Park Service, the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation, and three private
individuals (including the owner of the site containing the Avery/Caldwell County, North Carolina, population)
expressed strong support for the potential listing of the spruce-fir moss spider as an endangered species. The U.S.
Soil Conservation Service, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,
Tennessee Valley Authority, and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture stated that they had no new or additional
information on the species or threats to its continued existence. No negative comments were received. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the spruce-fir
moss spider (

Microhexura montivaga

) are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range



The spruce-fir moss spider is known to be endemic only to high-elevation spruce-fir forests of western North Carolina
and eastern Tennessee. Historically, the species has been reported from four sites in North Carolina and one in Tennessee.
In North Carolina the species has been recorded from two sites in Swain County, one in Yancey County, and one in Avery
and Caldwell Counties (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). In Tennessee, the species is known from only one site in Sevier County
(Coyle 1981).

During 1989 and through 1992, both historic and potential habitat of the species was surveyed (Harp 1991, 1992). No
new populations of the spruce-fir moss spider were discovered, and of the five previously recorded populations,
only one_the Avery and Caldwell County, North Carolina, population_appears to be stable (Harp 1992). 
The Yancey County, North Carolina, population appears to have been extirpated, and only a single individual could
be found at each of the two sites in Swain County, North Carolina (Harp 1992). The population in Sevier County, Tennessee,
was surveyed in 1989 and was considered to be relatively healthy at that time (Harp 1991). However, revisits to this
site in 1992 indicated the population level is declining, apparently in conjunction with a rapid decline in the forest
canopy occurring at the site and associated desiccation of moss-mat habitat (Harp 1992). 
The spruce-fir moss spider is very sensitive to desiccation and requires situations of high and constant humidity
(Coyle 1981; Harp 1991, 1992). Loss of forest canopy leading to increased light and decreased moisture on the forest
floor (resulting in desiccation of the moss mats) appears to be the major cause for the loss and decline of the spruce-fir
moss spider at all four of these sites and the major threat to the species' continued existence. In a 1991 letter to Keith
Langdon (National Park Service, Great Smoky Mountains National Park), Dr. Frederick Coyle (Western Carolina University)
indicated that the spruce-fir moss spider was common at one of the sites in Swain County, North Carolina, as late as
1983 but was extremely rare by 1988. In his letter to Keith Langdon, Dr. Coyle stated that many of the moss mats at this
site had become dry and loose, which he suspected was due largely to deterioration of the forest canopy at the site.
Fraser firs at all four of these sites (the Swain and Yancey County sites in North Carolina and the Sevier County, Tennessee,
site) have suffered extensive mortality, believed to be primarily due to infestation by the balsam wooly adelgid
(J. Harp, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, personal communication, 1993), a nonnative insect pest believed to have
been introduced into the United States from Europe (Eager 1984). 
Atmospheric deposition of pollutants, primarily affecting the red spruce (Harp 1992), may also be a major factor
(either directly or indirectly) in the decline of the forest canopy at these sites. It has been estimated that the red
spruce at the site in Yancey County, North Carolina, where the species is now believed to be extirpated, have lost 75
to 90 percent of their foliage (Krahl-Urban et al. 1988), possibly due to acid precipitation. The death and thinning
of the canopy trees within these stands also cause the remaining trees to be more susceptible to wind and other storm
damage, which has become a major concern at the Sevier County, Tennessee, site (J. Harp, personal communication 1992).

The spruce-fir forest at the site harboring the Avery/Caldwell County, North Carolina, population of the spruce-fir
moss spider has not experienced the degree of decline that has occurred (and is occurring) at the other sites known
to support (or to have supported) populations of the spider. However, the same factors that are believed to have resulted
in the decline of the spruce-fir forest and the associated loss of suitable moss-mat habitat at these other sites potentially
threaten this population and its habitat at this site as well. 




B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



The spruce-fir moss spider is not currently known to be commercially valuable; however, because of its extreme rarity
and uniqueness, it is conceivable that it could be sought by collectors. It is one of only two members of the genus Microhexura

, it is the only representative of the primitive family 

Dipluridae

 in eastern North America, and it is one of the smallest of the world's ``tarantulas.'' While collecting or other intentional
take is not presently identified as a factor contributing to the species' decline, the low numbers, slow reproductive
rate, and extremely restricted range of the spruce-fir moss spider make it unlikely that the species could withstand
even moderate collecting pressure. 




C. Disease or Predation



It is presently unknown whether disease or predation have played a role in the decline of the spruce-fir moss spider.
Further research is needed in this area. While predation is not thought to be a significant threat to a healthy population
of the spruce-fir moss spider, it could limit the recovery of the species or contribute to the local extirpation of
populations already depleted by other factors. Possible predators of the spruce-fir moss spider include pseudoscorpions,
centipedes, and other spiders (Harp 1992). 


D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



Neither the State of North Carolina nor the State of Tennessee include arachnids on their lists of endangered and threatened
species; therefore, the species is unprotected in both States. Federal listing would provide protection for the
spruce-fir moss spider throughout its range by requiring Federal permits to take the species and by requiring Federal
agencies to consult with the Service when activities they fund, authorize, or carry out may affect the species. 


E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence 

Only one of the four remaining populations of this species appears stable. The other three surviving populations
are extremely small, and all four populations are geographically isolated from one another. Therefore, the long-term
genetic viability of these populations is in doubt. Also, the restricted range of each of the surviving populations
makes them extremely vulnerable to extirpation from a single event or activity, such as a severe storm, fire, land-clearing
or timbering operation, pesticide/herbicide application, etc. Because they are isolated from one another, natural
repopulation of an extirpated population would be unlikely without human intervention. 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list the spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga

) as an endangered species. The species has been greatly reduced in numbers throughout the majority of its historic
range and presently is known to occur at only four locations. At two of these locations, only lone individuals_one
at each location_have been observed in recent years; at a third location the species has undergone a rapid decline
in numbers and is endangered by further habitat degradation/alteration. Only one of the remaining populations appears
to be stable at this time, and it is potentially threatened by many of the same factors that are believed to have resulted
in the extirpation or decline of the other historically known populations. Due to the species' history of population
loss and decline and the extreme vulnerability of the surviving populations, endangered status appears to be appropriate
for this species. Critical habitat is not being proposed for this species at this time for the reasons discussed below.

Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose any habitat of a species that is considered to be critical at the time the species is proposed to be endangered
or threatened. The Service's regulations [50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)] state that designation of critical habitat is not
prudent when one or both of the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other activity
and the identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of threat to the species or (2) such
designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. The Service finds that designation of critical
habitat is not prudent for this species. Such a determination would result in no known benefit to the spruce-fir moss
spider, and designation of critical habitat could further threaten the species. 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires that Federal agencies insure that their actions are not likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of listed species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat. (See the ``Available Conservation Measures'' section for a further discussion of Section 7.) As part of
the development of this proposed rule, Federal and State agencies were notified of the spider's general distribution,
and they were requested to provide data on proposed Federal actions that might adversely affect the species. No specific
projects were identified. Should any future projects be proposed in areas inhabited by the spruce-fir moss spider,
the involved Federal agency will already have the general distribution data needed to determine if the species may
be impacted by their action. If needed, more specific distribution information would be provided. 
Three of the four surviving populations of the spruce fir moss spider are considered to be extremely small, and suitable
habitat at each of the four sites still supporting the species is very limited. The precarious status of the species
means that any Federal action with the potential to result in significant adverse modification or destruction of
the species' habitat would also likely jeopardize its continued existence. Under these conditions, no additional
protection for the spruce-fir moss spider would accrue from critical habitat designation that would not also accrue
from listing the species. Consequently, when listed, habitat protection for the spruce-fir moss spider will be accomplished
through the Section 7 jeopardy standard and Section 9 prohibitions against take. 
In addition, the spruce-fir moss spider is very rare and unique, and taking for scientific purposes and private collection
could pose a threat if specific site information was released. The publication of critical habitat maps in the 

Federal Register

, local newspapers, and other publicity accompanying critical habitat designation could increase the collection
threat. The locations of populations of these species have consequently been described only in general terms in this
proposed rule. Any existing precise locality data would be available to appropriate Federal, State, and local government
agencies from the Service office described in the ``

ADDRESSES

'' section; from the Service's Raleigh Field Office, P.O. Box 33726, Raleigh, North Carolina 27636-3726; the
Service's Cookeville Field Office, 446 Neal Street, Cookeville, Tennessee 38501; and from the North Carolina Wildlife
Resources Agency, North Carolina Natural Heritage Program, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed
or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires
Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species
is subsequently listed, Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely
modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible
Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. The Service has notified Federal agencies that may
have programs which could affect the species. Federal activities that could occur and impact the species include,
but are not limited to, the carrying out or issuance of permits for construction, recreation or development actions
that could result in the loss or thinning of the high-elevation forest canopy, and pesticide or herbicide applications
for the control of noxious insects or weeds. It has been the experience of the Service, however, that nearly all Section
7 consultations have been resolved so that the species has been protected and the project objectives have been met.

The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt
any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer
for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,
transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies. 
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for
scientific purposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. In some instances, permits may be issued during a specified period of time to relieve
any undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. Such permits are not expected
for the spruce-fir moss spider since the species is not in trade. 


Public Comments Solicited 


The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned government agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning: 
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; 
(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and 
(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species. 
Final promulgation of the regulation on the spruce-fir moss spider will take into consideration the comments and
any additional information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs
from this proposal. 
The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received
within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and should be addressed
to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville Field Office, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville,
North Carolina 28806. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 4(a) of the Act. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

Endangered and Threatened Species; Delta Smelt and Sacramento Splittail; Water Quality Standards for Sacramento
River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta




AGENCIES: 

Environmental Protection Agency and Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules; notice of public hearings and extension of public comment periods.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), under section 303 of the Clean Water Act, give notice that joint public hearings will be held
in California for the revised proposed critical habitat determination for the delta smelt (

Hypomesus transpacificus

), the proposed threatened status for the Sacramento splittail (

Pogonichthys macrolepidotus

), and the proposed water quality standards for surface waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San
Francisco Bay and Delta, California. The comment periods for the Service's proposed rules for the delta smelt and
the Sacramento splittail will be extended.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



The three proposals being addressed at the public hearings are components of a coordinated Federal interagency initiative
responding to water management issues in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. EPA and the Service are working closely together
and with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented
approach to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California.
Critical habitat designation for the federally listed threatened delta smelt would provide additional protection
under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of
the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on the size
and configuration of critical habitat.

Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California.
The Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. This species is primarily threatened by
large freshwater exports from Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of shallow water
habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and industrial chemicals.
EPA has proposed a rule to establish three sets of Federal criteria to protect the designated uses of the San Francisco
Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. The three sets include: (1) Salinity criteria protecting the estuarine
habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses; (2) salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity)
to protect the fish spawning (striped bass) designated use in the lower San Joaquin River; and (3) salmon smolt survival
index criteria to protect the fish migration and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary.
The hearings and the extension of the comment periods will allow all interested parties to submit oral or written comments
on the three related proposals. The three proposed rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1994 (delta smelt (59 FR 852), Sacramento splittail (59 FR 862), and EPA water quality standards (59 FR
810)).

In the January 6, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice for the proposed water quality standards, EPA published its intent to hold public hearings during the week
of February 21, 1994, in Fresno, California; Sacramento, California; and San Francisco, California. After further
consideration, it was decided to add a fourth hearing in the Los Angeles, California area in order to expand the public's
opportunity to comment on these proposals.
Subsection 4(b)(5)(E) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that the Service hold a public hearing, if it is requested within 45 days of the publication of a proposed
rule. In anticipation of public hearing requests, the Service announces a joint effort with EPA to hold four public
hearings in California on three related components of an interagency plan that addresses management of water and
fish and wildlife resources in the California estuary.
The Service and EPA have jointly scheduled four public hearings: (1) February 23, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from
6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Center Plaza, 2233 Ventura Avenue, Fresno, California; (2) February 24, 1994, from
1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Expo Inn, 1413 Howe Avenue, Sacramento, California; (3) February 25, 1994,
from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the EPA Regional Office, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California; and (4) February 28,
1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic Center Plaza, Irvine, California.
Those parties wishing to make statements for the record should bring copies of their statements to present to EPA and
the Service at the start of the hearings. Oral statements may be limited in length if the number of parties present at
the hearings necessitates such a limitation. There are, however, no limits to the length of written comments or materials
presented at the hearing or mailed to the respective agencies. Written comments carry the same weight as oral comments.
EPA's January 6, 1994, notice set the due date for all written comments related to their proposed rule for March 11,
1994. The comment periods on the two Service proposed rules are extended to March 11, 1994. Written comments should
be submitted to EPA or the Service at their respective offices given above in the 

ADDRESSES

 section.

<DOCTITLE>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 90-Day Finding for a Petition To List the Ohlone Tiger Beetle
as Endangered </DOCTITLE>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of petition finding and commencement of status review.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding on a petition to list the Ohlone tiger beetle
(

Cicindela ohlone

) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The Service finds that the petition presents substantial
information indicating that the requested action may be warranted for this species. Through issuance of this document,
the Service now requests additional data and comments from the public regarding the status of the Ohlone tiger beetle.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service
make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding
is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act further requires the Service to make a finding as to whether or not the petitioned action
is warranted within 1 year of receipt of a petition that presents substantial information. 
On February 18, 1993, the Service received a petition from Mr. Randall Morgan to list the Ohlone tiger beetle as an endangered
species under the Act. The petition was dated February 12, 1993. A letter acknowledging receipt of the petition was
mailed to the petitioner on March 30, 1993. 
The finding is based on the species' description (Freitag 

et al. 

1993), other published literature, agency documents and reports, and field sightings. Interviews were conducted
with entomologists familiar with the biology of tiger beetles, with planners, and with others who are knowledgeable
about proposed projects that may negatively affect the Ohlone tiger beetle. All documents and records of telephone
conversations upon which this finding is based are on file at the Ventura Field Office (see 

ADDRESSES 

section).

The Ohlone tiger beetle's adult morphology, geographic distribution, habitat distribution (both historic and
current), phenology, phylogenetic relationships, and distinguishing features, as well as concerns for its future,
were described by Freitag 

et al. 

(1993). Species determination was based on external morphological characteristics, especially male and female
genitalia, and phenology. 
The larvae of 

Cicindela ohlone 

have not been found; therefore, information on their life history requirements is unknown. In general, however,
the larvae of other members of the genus 

Cicindela 

construct burrows that are usually perpendicular to the soil surface (Kaulbars and Freitag 1993). Development of
tiger beetle larvae takes approximately 2 years (Lindroth 1974). 
The Ohlone tiger beetle is known from only four locations in Santa Cruz County, California: (1) The west side of the
city of Santa Cruz, (2) Soquel (the type locality) (Kavanaugh, 

in litt.

, 1992), (3) upper or north campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz, and (4) city of Scotts Valley (Morgan,


in litt.

, 1993; Freitag 

et al. 

1993; R. Morgan, pers. comm., 1993). All locations are within an approximate range of 16 square miles. There are six
other locations with suitable habitat where the Ohlone tiger beetle may occur in Santa Cruz County. One is at another
site at the north campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz; a second location is at Pogonip Open Space Preserve
adjacent to the University of California; a third area is in Soquel near the type locality; and a fourth is at another
site in Scotts Valley. The remaining two locations are northwest of Cabrillo College and near Seascape (Morgan, 

in litt.

, 1993). Additional sites in Santa Cruz County appear to have suitable habitat for the species, but survey results
yielded no Ohlone tiger beetles in 1991 or 1992. 
The habitat for the adult Ohlone tiger beetle consists of coastal terraces with remnant stands of open native grassland
containing 

Stipa pulchra 

(purple needlegrass), 

Danthonia californica 

(California oat grass), 

Perideridia gairdneri 

(Gairdner's yampa), and/or 

Perideridia kelloggii 

(Kellogg's yampa) (Morgan, 

in litt.

, 1992; Freitag 

et al. 

1993). Soils at these level or nearly level sites are shallow, poorly-drained pale clay or sandy clay soils over bedrock
of Santa Cruz Mudstone (Freitag 

et al. 

1993). 
Adult tiger beetles generally occupy sun-exposed or open areas within their habitat to thermoregulate (Lindroth
1974, Knisley 

et al. 

1990). Suggested microhabitat for the larval form of the Ohlone tiger beetle is the same native grassland habitat
used by adults but in areas where the vegetation is taller and denser (Freitag 

et al. 

1993). 
Of about 20,000 acres of pristine and disturbed grassland habitat remaining in Santa Cruz County, only 200 to 300 acres
contain the right combination of substrate, slope, and exposure to be deemed suitable habitat for the Ohlone tiger
beetle (Morgan, 

in litt.

, 1992; Freitag 

et al. 

1993). This habitat is currently limited to small disjunct areas near the coast in central Santa Cruz County. 
The habitat type for this species was once more widespread and almost contiguous, ranging from the just west of the
city of Santa Cruz east along the coast and near-coastal areas to Seascape (Freitag 

et al. 

1993; Morgan, 

in litt.

, 1993). This area has been developed for residential, commercial, and agricultural use and includes the communities
of Santa Cruz, Capitola, and Live Oak. In adjacent Monterey County, these clay-based marine terrace grasslands have
already been urbanized (Freitag 

et al. 

1993). Limited suitable habitat may occur at low and mid-elevation coastal areas southwest of the Santa Cruz Mountains
in extreme southwestern San Mateo County (Freitag 

et al. 

1993). 
Of the four areas where the Ohlone tiger beetle has been documented, two are threatened by proposed residential development
(Freitag 

et al. 

1993; Morgan, 

in litt.

, 1993). At a third site, adult tiger beetles have been killed by bicycle traffic along a trail where the adult beetles
congregate. The University of California also plans to expand and construct university housing in habitat of the
Ohlone tiger beetle (Chris Aldecoa, University of California, Santa Cruz, pers. comm., 1993). At the Soquel site,
preliminary biological studies on vegetation have been completed for a proposed residential development (Morgan,


in litt.

, 1992). This site and another near Pogonip Open Space Preserve are threatened by non-native 

Eucalyptus 

sp. and 

Cytisus monspessulanus 

(French broom) (Morgan, 

in litt.

, 1992). These non-native plants convert sunny, open grassland habitat needed by adult Ohlone tiger beetles to habitat
dominated by a woody overstory that would shade the grasses and eliminate areas necessary for thermoregulation.

The Ohlone tiger beetle is not currently protected by any regulatory mechanism. The California Endangered Species
Act does not apply to insects. The available information suggests that the species' restricted range and small population
size increase the chance of extirpation resulting from stochastic (i.e., random) or localized events, such as rock
slides, erosion, disease, or predation. 
The petition and supporting information have been reviewed by staff at the Ventura Field Office and the Portland Regional
Office of the Service. The Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing
the Ohlone tiger beetle may be warranted. The Service requests any additional data, comments, and suggestions from
the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested
parties concerning the status of the Ohlone tiger beetle. Of particular interest is information regarding: 
(1) The existence and status of additional populations; 
(2) Environmental factors determining distribution, including specific habitat needs; 
(3) Early life history; and 
(4) The response of populations to disturbances such as fire, clearing, or mowing. 
This decision is based on information contained in the petition and scientific and commercial information otherwise
available to the Service at this time.

<DOCTITLE>Species Being Considered for Changes to the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species

Request for information.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or Convention) regulates
international trade in certain animal and plant species, which are listed in the appendices of this treaty. The United
States, as a Party to CITES, may propose amendments to the appendices for consideration by the other Parties.



This notice invites comments and information from the public on species that have been identified as candidates for
U.S. proposals to amend Appendix I or II at the next biennial meeting of Party countries.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In its previous notice on this subject (58 FR 38112; July 15, 1993), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) requested
information on plant and animal species that might lead the Service to prepare proposals to amend the CITES appendices
for consideration at the upcoming ninth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. That notice described the provisions
of CITES for listing species in the appendices and set forth information requirements for proposals. The present
notice announces the proposals received, explains why the Service does not intend to consider certain proposals,
and describes those proposals that will receive further consideration prior to a decision as to whether to submit
any of these proposals to the CITES Secretariat by the June 10, 1994, deadline.



The Service received proposals from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), the Fauna and Flora Preservation
Society (FFPS), ICCAT Watch (a coalition consisting of the Center for Marine Conservation, the National Audubon
Society, and World Wildlife Fund-US), the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Oregon Natural Resources Council,
by September 28, 1993. These organizations proposed adding or transferring nine different taxa, and in addition,
EIA proposed transferring all bird species listed in Appendix III to Appendix II. In addition, the Service is considering
the development of certain other proposals.

The Service continues to consider submitting proposals to amend the appendices for the following species: Narwhal
(for possible transfer from Appendix II to Appendix I); musk deer (for possible listing of species or populations
in Appendix I); saiga antelope (for listing in Appendix I or II); box turtles (add to Appendix II); copperbelly water
snake (add to Appendix II); bluefin tuna (add to Appendix II); whale shark (add to Appendix II); requiem and hammer-head
sharks (add to Appendix II); tarantulas (add to Appendix II); Port-Orford-Cedar (add to Appendix II with its logs,
sawn wood, and veneer only); bigleaf mahogany (add to Appendix II with exclusion of secondary and finished products);
and two genera of African mahoganies with their logs, sawn wood, and veneer only (for possible listing in Appendix
II). The Service will continue to consider a listing of freshwater pearly mussels that will provide protection to
the most endangered while excluding those easily identifiable species that are used in the pearl bead industry and
that are not believed to be threatened by trade. The Service is also considering a proposal to remove the non-African
populations of aloes from the appendices. In addition, the Service at the suggestion of the CITES Nomenclature Committee
will consider developing a proposal to clarify the present listing of the urial, 

Ovis vignei.

Proposals That the Service Does Not Plan To Submit



EIA submitted a recommendation with no accompanying information to transfer all birds listed in Appendix III to Appendix
II. The Service first notes that the basis for a country adding a species to Appendix III is different from the criteria
for including a species in Appendix II. Moreover, while trade ultimately may became detrimental to the survival of
any Appendix III species if not carefully regulated, insufficient information was presented by EIA to justify proposals
for individual species at this time.

ICCAT Watch submitted a proposal to list the western Atlantic population of the bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus

, in Appendix I. In a subsequent letter, after the November 1993 meeting of the Parties to the International Convention
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), ICCAT Watch withdrew their request for the Service to consider proposing
this bluefin tuna population in Appendix I. Based on the actions taken by ICCAT (as presented later in this notice under
the consideration of an Appendix II listing for bluefin tuna), the Service does not believe that listing the western
population of bluefin tuna in Appendix I is appropriate.

The blue shark, 

Prionace glauca

, was proposed for possible listing in Appendix II or III, by the National Audubon Society in 1991. The Service has reconsidered
the recommendation in preparation for COP9. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Fishery Management Plan
for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed these sharks in the pelagic species group. In the preparation for development
of the management plan, a peer review effort by NMFS and non-NMFS experts evaluated the available information and
determined that there was no evidence available to indicate that the pelagic species group of sharks was overfished
in the Northwest Atlantic. In comparison with other sharks, blue sharks have a relatively high reproductive rate
and rapid growth rate, and are widely distributed. Hence, they may be more resilient and more robust with respect to
fishing pressure than many other shark species. Therefore, the Service does not intend to propose this species for
listing in Appendix II, or to list it unilaterally in Appendix III.



Proposals That the Service May Submit



The following proposals are being considered for submission as proposed amendments to the CITES appendices. The
Service seeks additional comments and information to assist it in making decisions whether to submit these proposed
amendments.



1. Narwhal (Monodon monoceros)



EIA proposed that the narwhal be transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I. The Small Cetacean Subcommittee of the
Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission has had difficulty in carrying out stock assessments
for this species due to the amount of available data, and has expressed concern about catch levels and loss rates for
some narwhal populations. The degree to which trade, as opposed to hunting for food, determines the level of narwhal
catches is unclear. Therefore, the Service seeks information about population levels, stock structure, catches,
and trade of this species, but without additional information on the threat to the species, the Service is unlikely
to propose the transfer of this species to Appendix I.



2. Musk Deer (Moschus spp.)



The Service received a draft proposal from EIA to transfer the Appendix II populations of musk deer (

Moschus

 spp.) to Appendix I of CITES. The musk deer, represented by at least four valid species, have a wide distribution in
eastern Russia, Mongolia, Korea, China (including the Tibet Autonomous Region), the Himalayas (from northern Afghanistan
eastwards to Nepal and Bhutan), and marginally into northern Vietnam. They range from comparatively low elevations
(coniferous forests) to the highest growth of dwarf rhododendron and willow thickets (about 12,500 feet or 3,800
meters).

Musk deer are the most primitive of all living deer. Antlers are lacking in both sexes, and males have long upper canine
teeth that extend far below the upper lip. A musk gland in the abdomen of the male secretes a brownish wax-like substance,
which is used extensively in the manufacture of perfumes and soaps. About 28 to 30 grams (a little over an ounce) of the
secretion can be obtained from a single male. Due to their secretive nature and inaccessible habitat, little is known
about the population numbers of musk deer.

At the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP4) to CITES held in Botswana in 1983, the Parties voted to
transfer the Himalayan populations (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, India, Nepal, and Pakistan) from Appendix II to
Appendix I. Although there are widespread reports of rampant poaching, the trade in musk is poorly documented. The
CITES Animals Committee working on significantly traded species, has identified this taxon as one for which possible
problems exist and has recommended: (1) That China and Russia suspend exports of specimens of musk deer, excluding
derivatives; and (2) that all Parties increase their enforcement efforts to ensure that all specimens of 

Moschus

 spp. in international trade, including derivatives, have been legally exported. Therefore, the Service is considering
proposing the transfer of the Appendix II populations of musk deer to Appendix I. However, trade in musk from captive
stock is reported, and the CITES Animals Committee has requested a report on production from captive stocks and information
on the source of musk used for medicine manufacture and details of measures taken to control trade in manufactured
products. The Service seeks information on the effect of trade on these species, especially any data on the volume
of musk entering trade.

3. Saiga Antelope (

Saiga tatarica

)


EIA submitted a draft proposal to the Service to include the saiga antelope in Appendix I of CITES. There are two recognized
subspecies: The Russian saiga (

Saiga tatarica tatarica

) and the Mongolian saiga (

Saiga tatarica mongolica

). Historically the saiga antelope ranged from the Ukraine to western Mongolia. Today, the species remains only in
the area stretching from the steppe east of the lower Volga River across Kazakhstan through the Dzungarian Basin of
northwest China to Mongolia. Presently, its distribution within Russia is not continuous, but is divided into disjunct
populations. Saiga antelopes inhabit steppes and semideserts, from sea level to 5,000 feet. This antelope lives
in large herds, and the early maturation and fecundity of this species allow for rapid population increases, reaching
60 to 80 percent annually.

In the 1960s the saiga antelope was the most widespread wild ungulate in the U.S.S.R., and it was estimated that approximately
2 million animals inhabited Asia. However, the population in Mongolia is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered
Species Act (ESA). Other than humans, wolves are the main predator of the species. Lack of fodder in winter is the most
important natural calamity causing mass mortality of saiga antelopes. This species is harvested for its meat, hides,
fat, as well as the horns, which are exported to China. Since the 1960s, little scientific information is available
on population size and trade in parts. The Service solicits additional information on international trade and population
status, in order to make its final decision on whether to propose the entire species for listing in Appendix II, and
if so, whether to propose any populations for Appendix I.


4. Urial (

Ovis vignei

)


At the Plenipotentiary meeting of the CITES Parties in 1973, 

Ovis vignei

 was included in Appendix I, as proposed by India, and was also referred to as urial and shapo. However, because there
was no supporting documentation submitted at the time of the proposed listing, and because different references
available in early 1973 attributed different subspecies and populations to 

Ovis vignei,

 it is not completely clear what population(s) the Parties intended to protect. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott's Checklist
of Palaearctic and Indian Mammals (1966, British Museum) considered 

 O. vignei

 to be restricted to those populations in Kashmir and Ladak. 

Ovis orientalis vignei

 had been described by Blyth in 1841 from specimens collected in Ladak, India.
Also at the Plenipotentiary meeting, Afghanistan proposed including 

Ovis orientalis

 in Appendix III (Afghanistan proposed subspecies listings for five other mammals but not for 

Ovis orientalis

). However, it never did list this species; whether this is because it considered their populations to be covered by
the 

Ovis vignei

 listing or whether the desire of the government to include them in Appendix III had changed by the time that Afghanistan
acceded to CITES on January 28, 1986, is unknown.
At the time of the Second Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP2) in 1979, the Parties apparently considered


Ovis vignei

 to include populations of urial in Iran. This interpretation is based on the absence of any debate on the coverage of
the Appendix I listing when Iran proposed to delete 

Ovis vignei arkal

 from Appendix I. (Iran later withdrew the proposal.) While one might have expected several Plenipotentiary meeting
participants to also have participated in COP2 and to have commented on any inconsistency between the original listing
and the proposal presented at COP2, it is not known with certainty what was the original intent of the Parties.
In the CITES-adopted checklist for mammals, Mammal Species of the World by Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl (1982), 

Ovis vignei

 is considered to represent those populations from eastern Iran to Ladak, and 

Ovis orientalis

 (also known as 

Ovis aries

) is considered to represent those populations from western Iran to Turkey.

Adoption of a new nomenclatural reference by the Parties cannot change the entity originally listed, and, as previously
noted, that listing seems unclear. A new reference, Mammals Species of the World, 2nd edition, by Wilson and Reeder
(1993), retains the distribution assigned to 

Ovis vignei

 and 

Ovis aries

 (=

orientalis

) in the earlier 1982 checklist, but further highlights the issue by including synonyms (usually subspecies or species)
that are associated with 

Ovis vignei

 and 

Ovis aries

 (=

orientalis

). For 

Ovis vignei

 these synonyms include some names that some individuals have associated with 

Ovis orientalis

, e.g., 

arabica, arkal, blanfordi, bochariensis, cycloceros, dolgopolovi, punjabiensis, severtzovi, varentsowi.







Note:

 The entity referred to above as 

severtzovi

 is located between population centers of 

Ovis vignei

 and 

Ovis ammon,

 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has previously included this entity as 

Ovis ammon

 in the listing of this species as endangered pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Act.




The CITES Nomenclature Committee has not considered the listing issue to be clear enough to make a nomenclatural interpretation,
and therefore, since the Parties should make this decision, the Service is considering submitting a proposal to clarify
what populations are included in Appendix I as a result of the 1973 listing of 

Ovis vignei.

The Service seeks information on the status of and trade in the various populations/subspecies of the urial distributed
from northwest India, through Pakistan (except for the extreme northern portion), Afghanistan (except for the extreme
northeast portion), western Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, to northern and eastern Iran. The Service may propose
listing any or all of these populations in Appendix I or Appendix II.



5. Box Turtles (Terrapene

 spp.)



Prior to the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 1992 (COP8), the New York Zoological Society submitted
a proposal to the Service for its consideration, to add the genus 

Terrapene

 (box turtles) to Appendix II, while retaining 

T. coahuila

 (Aquatic box turtle, or Coahuilan box turtle) in Appendix I. The Service initially considered submitting this proposal
for consideration at COP8, but decided not to due to a lack of trade data. The Service is now considering submitting
this proposal, based on both biological information and trade information from the Service's Law Enforcement Management
Information System (LEMIS). While a separate code for data entry of information on trade in specimens of this genus
was provided after COP8, the Service's records of exports and imports in LEMIS for species not listed in the CITES appendices
are to be considered as a minimum for the numbers of specimens in trade.

The genus 

Terrapene

 is comprised of four species (

T. carolina, T. coahuila, T. nelsoni

, and 

T. ornata

), with 11 recognized subspecies; 

T. coahuila

 is already listed in Appendix I.



Terrapene nelsoni

 has a very small and fragmented range on the west coast of Mexico. 

Terrapene ornata

 ranges over large sections of the midwestern United States and the Great Plains, from Texas north to southern South
Dakota, and eastward to Indiana. 

Terrapene carolina

 is the most widely distributed species of box turtle, and is found from Canada to Mexico; its range is from Maine southward
to Florida, and westward through southern Canada to Michigan, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Although widespread,
the species is reported to be rare or extinct in parts of its range in Maine, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ontario, and
declining elsewhere in its range.

Box turtles are long-lived and slow-growing, with low annual reproductive output and late onset of sexual maturity
(10-20 years). They also have high site fidelity, and loss of adults from a population can have a significant
detrimental effect on the status of the population. Box turtles are important components of many terrestrial ecosystems.
Development activities have increasingly fragmented their habitats. The sale of 

T. carolina

 and 

T ornata

 is restricted in several States, while allowed in others.

Based on Service LEMIS data, 26,817 box turtles were exported from the United States in 1992, and 18,134 were exported
in 1993. However, 1993 data are not yet fully entered into the computer system, and are thereby incomplete. These figures
represent the number of box turtles reported to the Service as being exported; it is not possible to ascertain how many
were removed from the wild. Whether or not this level of international trade in these species is detrimental to populations
must take into account the numbers removed from the wild for international trade along with the numbers removed from
the wild for other purposes, including but not limited to interstate and intrastate commerce, habitat loss, habitat
degradation, disease, and predation.

The Service solicits additional information on population trends, levels of trade, and the affect of trade on population
status for review in deciding whether to submit a proposal to include the genus 

Terrapene

 in Appendix II, while retaining 

T. coahuila

 in Appendix I.



6. Copperbelly Water Snake (Nerodia erythrogaster)



The northern subspecies. 

Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta,

 of this water snake is considered to be threatened. The current distribution of this subspecies is restricted to the
lower Ohio River Valley and the lower Wabash River Valley in extreme southwestern Indiana and adjacent Illinois and
Kentucky, and in southern Michigan northeastern Indiana, and northwestern Ohio. Due to significant population
declines, especially in Michigan, Ohio, and northern Indiana, the subspecies now persists only in scattered, isolated
pockets where suitable habitat exists. The total population is estimated approximately 1,530 adults rangewide,
with 368 breeding pairs.

A proposed rule to list the northern copperbelly water snake as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA)
was signed by the Service's Director on July 26, 1993. Recently there appear to be indications that this taxon is intercrossing
with another subspecies in areas of overlap of the ranges of these two taxa.

Habitat loss and fragmentation are the primary factors threatening the continued existence of the subspecies, but
amateur collectors reportedly continue to take snakes from the wild. It is sought because of its rarity, its large
size, its unique coloration, and its value in the pet trade. It is reported that an international commercial dealer
offered $260 for a breeding pair of northern copperbelly water snakes.

The Service is seeking information on the extent and significance of trade in the species, and would consider proposing
the entire species for Appendix II if there is sufficient concern about similarity of appearance.

7. Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus)



The Service received a draft proposal from ICCAT Watch, a coalition consisting of the National Audubon Society, the
Center for Marine Conservation, and World Wildlife Fund-US, to list bluefin tuna throughout the Atlantic in Appendix
II.

Previously, a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 33894, July 24, 1991) seeking comments on a proposal from the National Audubon Society to list the western Atlantic
stock of bluefin tuna in Appendix I. The NMFS initially recommended that public comment be received on the merits of
proposing the species for listing in Appendix II. After review of all comments and available information, the Service
decided not to propose listing of the species in either appendix.

Management of the Atlantic bluefin tuna falls under the responsibility of parties to the ICCAT. Provisions of Article
XIV of CITES relieve ICCAT member countries from CITES obligations with respect to trade in specimens of marine species
included in Appendix II, if such trade is in accordance with the provisions of ICCAT and if a certificate stipulating
to this condition is given by the CITES Management Authority of the country of introduction.

For western Atlantic bluefin tuna, the current stock assessment (1993) by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research
and Statistics (SCRS) estimated stock trajectories showing a significant decline from 1970 to 1992 but with a small
increase in 1993. The 1993 median estimate of abundance for 8-year-old and older tuna is 10.9 percent of the 1970 median,
20 percent of the 1977 median, 43 percent of the 1982 median, and 78 percent of the 1988 median. In terms of spawning biomass,
current abundance is estimated at between 6 percent and 12 percent of that which could produce maximum sustainable
yield. Projections by the SCRS stock abundance, based on the assumption that the current relationship between spawning
biomass and recruitment will prevail in the future, suggest that there is about a 50 percent chance of preventing further
decline in mature stock size if catches between 1994 and 2001 were limited to 1,200 metric tons per year (mt/yr). Lower
catches result in higher odds of preventing further reductions in spawning stock. The allowable catch in 1994 is,
1,995 mt. The allowable catch in 1995 is 1,200 mt, subject to scientific review of the most recent assessment results.

In addition, there is an uncertainty about the proper north-south dividing line between the western and eastern populations.
In recent years, Japanese vessels have harvested a substantial tonnage of bluefin tuna just east of the original N-S
line. At least a portion of this take may have included tuna from the western population.

For eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, the 1992 assessment shows great variability in the abundance of the youngest age
groups (ages 1-4) over the period 1970-91). Estimates of abundance of fish 5 years old or older, which includes
most of the spawning stock, have shown a consistent downward trend, the average abundance of fish 5 years old or older
for 1990-92 being about one half the average estimate for 1970-72. Abundance estimates for the oldest
fish of this stock (ages 10 and older) have shown an even greater downward trend since 1970. The average estimated abundance
of fish in this age group for the period 1990-92 was about one third of the average estimate for the 1970-72
period.

Recent (1991) estimated fishing mortality rates for eastern Atlantic bluefin are between 2 and 7 times the common
fishing mortality rate reference levels which are thought to result in long-term average yields near maximum sustainable
yield and provide adequate safeguards against recruitment failure. Over the long term, fishing mortality rates
as high as those estimated are likely to result in increased risks of stock collapse.

At COP8, Sweden proposed the listing of the western Atlantic population of bluefin tuna in Appendix I and the eastern
Atlantic population in Appendix II. The proposal was withdrawn by Sweden at the meeting based on a set of conditions
which primarily included the requirement that ``ICCAT continue its initiatives, with particular emphasis on quota
reductions, to restore and maintain Atlantic bluefin tuna populations * * *.''

<PARENT> FR940127-1-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT, the quota for take of the species in the western Atlantic was reduced from the 1991
level by 25 percent of 1994 and by another 30 percent for 1995, for a 55 percent total reduction since Sweden submitted
its resolution to COP8. In addition, the quota for Japanese fishing vessels, in the central Atlantic, whose harvest
had been 450 mt annually from the western Atlantic and about 1,000 mt annually from the eastern Atlantic, was capped
at 1,300 mt for the 2-year period 1994-95.

Progress was made on other conservation measures, including the development of a Bluefin Statistical Document (similar
to a CITES certificate of origin), which would be required by all ICCAT countries for the importation of bluefin tuna.
This document is already required for frozen bluefin tuna imports. It will be partially implemented for fresh tuna
by June 1994, and full implementation is scheduled for December 1994, when the document must be validated by the appropriate
government official. An intersessional meeting is scheduled for spring 1994 to discuss, among other things, the
use of trade measures as an enforcement tool. Thus, a proposal to list this species in Appendix II may not be warranted
at this time based on the progress at the last two ICCAT meetings.

However, ICCAT has not yet fully implemented the quota reductions or the Bluefin Statistical Document Program, and
other measures may be necessary for ICCAT to take with respect to non-ICCAT countries in order to supplement the existing
conservation regime. Therefore, the Service requests comments on the merits for an Appendix II listing of the entire
Atlantic population, particularly with respect to collecting trade date concerning non-ICCAT countries.



8. Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus)



EIA proposed that the whale shark be considered for CITES protection, and subsequently provided a draft proposal
to include this species in Appendix II. Whale sharks are large filter feeders and exist in the temperate seas throughout
the world. Whale sharks are vulnerable to commercial harpoon gear and collisions with vessels. Whale sharks have
supported small to medium commercial fisheries in India, Pakistan, China, the Philippines, and Senegal, where catches
may be increasing. The flesh is eaten fresh or after being slated and dried.

The whale shark is slow growing and may produce few young, and consequently, may be easily overexploited. The NMFS
Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed whale sharks in the large coastal species group,
and this group of sharks is considered to be overfished in the Northwest Atlantic and to have declined off southern
California. However, this species does not appear to be an important fisheries species.

Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the
Service is requesting information this species, but without more specific information indicating population declines
or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission of a proposal for this
species.



9. Requiem Sharks (Carcharhinidae spp.) and Hammerhead Sharks (Sphyrnidae spp.)



These species were proposed for review for inclusion in Appendix II or III, by the National Audubon Society in 1991.
At that time, the Service did not believe that sufficient information was available to propose these species for consideration
at COP8. However, the Service is re-examining this recommendation in preparation for COP9.

These species are normally targeted by commercial shark longline and gillnet fisheries and are also subject to take
in recreational fisheries. The NMFS Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed these sharks
in the large coastal species group, but many individuals of these species make extensive migrations. In the preparation
for development of the management plan, a peer review of effort by NMFS and non-NMFS experts evaluated the available
information and determined that the large coastal species group of sharks was overfished in the Northwest Atlantic.
As a consequence, catch quotas imposed for the large coastal shark species were set at levels representing a 30 percent
drop pattern. These sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation.

Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the
Service is requesting information on these species. However, without more specific information indicating specific
population declines or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission
of any proposal for these species.

10. Freshwater or Pearly Mussels (Family Unionidae)




The bivalve mollusc family Unionidae (pearly mussels or naiads) is one of the most diverse mollusc families in North
America. Their geographic distribution is widespread; naiads are found in most of the major river drainages in the
Southeast and Midwest, including the Upper Mississippi drainage system, and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas. Members
of this family also occur in Europe


At the Sixth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 1987, the Ten-Year Review Committee Chairman withdrew a proposal
to remove the six unionid species listed in Appendix II (with the other 26 species remaining in Appendix I) with the
understanding that the United States would review the need for the listings.


Most of the species included in Appendix I are listed as endangered pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and
two of the species included in Appendix II are now listed as endangered. However, seven of the Appendix I species and
the remaining four Appendix II species are not listed as endangered or threatened under ESA. A few species of pearly
mussels are valued as a source of beads for the cultured pearl industry, and shells of these species as well as the pearls
made from such shells are heavily traded. The Service's concern is how to provide the appropriate protection to the
endangered pearly mussels without unnecessarily regulating the trade in the few commercially valuable, non-threatened
mussels.


Mussel shells used in the manufacture of cultured pearls are identifiable by their heavier, all white shells, and
they occur in larger rivers and reservoirs with few species of endangered mussels. Furthermore, State regulations
usually prohibit the collection of shells from those sections of rivers with significant populations of the endangered
mussels. Even with these and other State restrictions, some endangered mussels may be harvested by the divers; however,
it is believed that the buyers exclude shells not valuable for the making of pearl beads, and the exporters further
screen all shells to sort them into species and size categories to fill specific orders from foreign buyers. Therefore,
the likelihood of endangered mussels being exported for the pearl industry is extremely low.


Rather, the potential trade threat to the endangered species may be from shell collectors and the use of shells in the
jewelry industry. It is probably only the most endangered species that would be affected by trade for collections,
and the Service is endeavoring to determine whether there is any threat to endangered species from the trade in mussels
for jewelry.


There are about 58 endangered freshwater mussels and another 53 that may be endangered but for which definitive status
information is not yet available. If the most endangered of these species may be affected by trade, having the species
listed under CITES would provide additional protection for the species. Therefore, the Service is considering preparing
a proposal to list in Appendix I only the most endangered of the species (thus, downlisting some of the present Appendix
I species) and proposing the remainder of the native species for inclusion in Appendix II, except those clearly identifiable
species exported for the pearl industry. The basis for this proposal would be either because of status of the species
or for reasons of similarity of appearance. The species that the Service is considering excluding are: 

Actinonaias ligamentina

 (=

A. carinata

), 

Amblema plicata

, 

Cyclonaias tuberculata

, 

Elliptio crassidens

, 

Elliparia lineolata

, 

Fusconaia ebena

, 

Fusconaia flava

, 

Ligumia recta

, 

Megalonaias nervosa

, 

Obliquaria reflexa

, 

Pleurobema cordatum

, 

Quadrula apiculata

, 

Quadrula metanevra

, 

Quadrula nodulata

, 

Quadrula pustulosa

, 

Quadrula quadrula

, and 

Tritogonia verrucosa

. This approach provides the shortest list (unless the entire unionid taxon were listed, which would add an unnecessary
permit burden), and the shorter list would assist enforcement officers in focusing their efforts. This approach
would also involve downlisting some species presently listed in Appendix I. An alternative may be that, for those
species where there is not a sufficient probability of trade to warrant any CITES listing, the Service might propose
the deletion of present Appendix I and II freshwater mussel species.


The Service would especially appreciate comments as to whether information already available sufficiently identifies
the most endangered species so that further identification of these species by listing them in Appendix I does not
increase the threat from collection. Additional information on the trade in shells for the jewelry industry would
be appreciated, as well as comments on the above recommendations for species to be excluded from any proposal that
the Service may submit.

11. Tarantulas (Brachypelma spp.)


The Service has been considering listing additional 

Brachypelma 

species to address look-alike concerns. As a result of the Service's discussions, a proposal was received from Dr.
Robert Wolff of Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Illinois, to list all members of the tarantula genus 

Brachypelma 

(also known as 

Euathlus 

and 

Brachypelmides

) in Appendix II of CITES. Most species of this genus have very limited distributions within the general area of Central
America from northern Mexico south into Colombia, and are known only from a very limited geographic region within
a single country. The very limited distributions of these species places each in greater danger of possible extinction.


Brachypelma 

tarantulas are ground-dwelling, burrowing spiders occurring from semi-desert regions, through tropical dry deciduous
forests, to tropical moist forests. The red-haired 

Brachypelma 

tarantulas are very popular as pets. They are long-lived spiders; the females frequently live up to 20 years, with
as many as 12 possible years for breeding. The males are only mature for a single breeding season and are heavily preyed
upon during their wanderings. Whereas up to 400 individual eggs may be produced in each egg sac, the number of hatchlings
surviving to adulthood is extremely small (about 1 percent). Therefore, the loss of mature individuals from a population
is a major threat to the species; larger individuals are preferred by the pet trade. Several species in the genus are
poorly described or virtually unknown, and no thorough population studies have been conducted on any of the species.
Very little is known about the trade in 

Brachypelma 

tarantulas and most specimens are probably coming out of Mexico without proper documentation. Mexico prevents the
hunting and export of tarantulas without a permit. At the Fifth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Buenos Aires,
1985), the United States proposed the inclusion of 

Brachypelma smithi 

(the red-kneed tarantula) in Appendix II because of widespread documented trade. The listing of all 

Brachypelma 

tarantulas would eliminate the present confusion over identification of which species are entering trade. Most
species within the genus are easily recognized by the red or reddish hairs on the legs or abdomen. The Service is, therefore,
considering the listing of all members of the genus 

Brachypelma 

in Appendix II and seeks information on the effects of trade on these tarantulas, especially any data on the volume
of specimens entering trade.


12. Port-Orford-Cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana)


In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) which initiated listing preparation for COP9, the Oregon Natural
Resources Council provided a thorough draft proposal to include the Lawson-cypress or Port-Orford-cedar (

Chamaecyparis lawsoniana

) in Appendix II. This species is native to southwestern Oregon and northwestern California within a general coastal
area of less than 200 by 100 miles, mostly from about Coos Bay, Oregon south to Arcata, California. It is also in cultivation
(and has a number of horticultural varieties). The species has been reduced both in range and by over 85 percent in natural
standing volume, and is now logged almost entirely for export (primarily to Japan). An introduced pathogen (

Phytophthora lateralis

) has been spreading particularly along waterways and as a side effect of soil transport by vehicles and logging equipment.
The main stimulus for the logging of Port-Orford cedar is high export prices, and one important stimulus for the construction
of many logging roads is the export of raw logs. This fungus has spread through the northern and western portions of
the tree species' range, and it has infected perhaps 20 percent of the remaining coastal stands. The root disease is
virulent, and the infected trees cannot be cured. By the mid-1980s, an estimated 60 percent of the trees of this species
in southwestern Oregon's young-growth forests had been killed by this introduced disease.
The Service is considering submission of a proposal to list the U.S. population of this species and its logs, sawn wood,
and veneer in Appendix II. Information is desired particularly on populations that are functioning naturally and
are effectively safe from habitat loss, exploitation, and infection; and in addition, information is requested
on the location of U.S. non-natural silvicultural plantations and the extent of such exports from them.

13. Bigleaf Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla)



American mahogany, the genus 

Swietenia,

 is native to the neotropics (56 FR 33898-33899, July 24, 1991). Two of the three species in this genus are listed
in CITES Appendix II: 

Swietenia humilis 

(Pacific Coast mahogany) including its parts and derivatives, which occurs in Mexico and Central America; and 

Swietenia mahagoni 

(Caribbean mahogany) including only its logs, sawn wood, and veneer, which occurs on some Caribbean islands and extends
to southern Florida. The unlisted species, 

Swietenia macrophylla 

(bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America to Mexico; it apparently forms hybrids naturally with 

S. humilis 

 in Costa Rica. In the Carribean, 

S. mahagoni

 seems to have crossed spontaneously with introduced 

S. macrophylla 

to form hybrids that have been called 

S. aubrevilleana. Swietenia 

species and hybrids also are in cultivation (and may be locally naturalized); some are grown ornamentally and/or
silviculturally. 

Swietenia macrophylla 

and 

S. mahagoni 

are grown with limited success in plantations in the tropics of the New and Old Worlds.

At COP8, Costa Rica and the United States proposed to include 

Swietenia macrophylla 

and its natural hybrid in Appendix II; the U.S. proposal excluded the Old World populations and secondary and final
products (e.g., finished products and derivatives). In a preliminary meeting during COP8, all the range States except
three (Bolivia, Peru and Honduras) tentatively supported the listing. Costa Rica decided to support the U.S. proposal.
However, because of lack of sufficient consensus, the United States withdrew its proposal (cf. 57 FR 20443, May 13,
1992).

In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) that initiated listing preparations for COP9, the Natural Resources
Defense Council provided a new extensive draft proposal to include the neotropical populations of 

Swietenia macrophylla

 and its natural hybrid in Appendix II, including only the timber and wood processed to the first stage of transformation
(i.e., primary products), such as logs, wood in the rough, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood. The September 1993
meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of a proposal for this species.

The Service regards the available information and data sufficient to support reproposing this species and its natural
hybrid, and believes that there is increasing understanding of the consequences and value of its regulation under
CITES Appendix II. The United States has become the main importer of this species, and the Service plans to provide
a draft proposal to the range States for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations that
are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.



14. African Mahoganies



The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society provided draft proposals to list the African mahoganies in Appendix II.
African mahoganies include the genera 

Entandrophragma 

(about 11 species) and 

Khaya 

(about 6 species), which are native to the tropics of Africa, with 

Khaya 

extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Some of the 17 species are in cultivation, including some silvicultural
plantations. The majority of the species have some legal protection in one or more countries, generally with respect
to their export. All of the species have been declining due to habitat conversion and selectively varied commercial
exploitation, and nearly all of them have been reported to be threatened in various countries and significant portions
of their ranges.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has recognized the need to conserve most 

Khaya 

and some 

Entandrophragma 

species, being concerned with their genetic erosion. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee reviewed
draft proposals for these genera, and favored the circulation of these drafts for their possible submission. In November
1993, Germany circulated them to the range States for their views. The Service may join with Germany's initiative,
or provide draft proposals to the range States by April 1994 for their comments. Information is desired particularly
on populations of each species that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.

15. Non-native aloes (

Aloe spp.)



All species of Aloe

 are included in the CITES appendices, with nearly all in Appendix II, including the plants called 

Aloe vera

 (synonym 

Aloe barbadensis

). The genus is essentially African in range, extending to Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula, and perhaps naturally
to the Canary Islands. Plants regarded as 

Aloe vera

 have been used for millennia and the yellow-flowered species may be extinct in its native range in the wild; it may have
been native to the Canary Islands, or perhaps the southern Arabian Peninsula or northeastern Africa (e.g., Ethiopia),
where similar species occur.

The whole plants commonly in trade as aloe vera are of artificially propagated (or also naturalized) origin. Their
regulation has become an enforcement burden. To deal with this situation, the Service is considering submission
of a proposal by June 1994 to remove the non-native populations of 

Aloe

 that are geographically unrelated to the general African area. Thus, all species of 

Aloe

 where they may be native, including all of Africa considered broadly (e.g., including neighboring islands such as
the Canary Islands and Socotra) and the Arabian Peninsula, would continue to be regulated by CITES. The September
1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of some such proposal on this problem, and the conservation
committee of the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study offered to assist in its preparation. Information
is requested on whether exclusion of plants from this non-native population of 

Aloe

 would significantly increase risk to the survival in its native range of any 

Aloe

 (

i.e.,

 species, subspecies, botanical variety, or significant population).




Future Actions



The Service will consider all available information in deciding which proposals warrant consideration by the Parties.
The U.S. proposals must be submitted to the CITES Secretariat by June 10, 1994, for consideration at the November 1994
meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. After the June date, the Service will publish
a further 

Federal Register

 notice to announce its decisions on the potential proposals discussed above. Persons having current biological
or trade information about the species being considered are invited to contact the Service's Office of Scientific
Authority at the above address.

The primary author of this notice is Dr. Charles W. Dane, Chief, Office of Scientific Authority, under the authority
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
amend its public information regulations to help ensure that the 
identities of those who report adverse events associated with 
human drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and the identities 
of patients are held in confidence and not disclosed by FDA, as 
provided in current agency rules, or by manufacturers that 
possess these reports. The proposed rule is intended to preempt 
the establishment or continuation in effect of any State or local 
law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that requires or 
permits disclosure of such identities. This action is being 
taken to maintain the agency's ability to collect information 
about safety risks of FDA-regulated products that is vital to 
protection of the public health. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


A. Introduction 


A critical public health activity of FDA is to monitor the 
safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices in the marketplace. 
As part of postmarketing surveillance programs to monitor the 
safety of these products, FDA relies heavily on its adverse event 
reporting systems. These reporting systems are important 
adjuncts to the product approval process, which is based 
primarily on testing conducted before a product is marketed. 
Although preapproval testing provides significant information 
about the safety and efficacy of a product, not all potential 
safety problems can be identified in the preapproval stage when 
the number of subjects exposed to the product and the period of 
exposure are necessarily limited. For that reason, the receipt 
of postmarket reports of adverse events associated with a 
regulated product is critical to the agency's ability to help 
protect the public health.

Reporting by physicians and other health care professionals 
of adverse experiences associated with the administration of most 
products is strictly voluntary. As the agency's primary source 
of adverse event information, this voluntary reporting system has 
revealed significant adverse events and drug interactions 
associated with products that could not be identified during the 
preapproval testing. There are many instances of important 
public health actions that have been the direct or indirect 
result of information provided through voluntary reporting by 
individual health professionals. The removal of the antibiotic 
temafloxacin (Omniflox) from the market, research concerning the 
danger of concurrent use of the antihistamine terfenadine 
(Seldane) when taken with either the antifungal ketoconazole or 
the antibiotic erythromycin, and the warning labeling requirement 
for latex products are just a few examples that demonstrate why 
FDA strongly encourages voluntary reporting by physicians and 
other health professionals. 
In a major effort to increase voluntary reporting of serious 
adverse events by health professionals, FDA recently announced a 
new reporting system called MEDWATCH. This program is designed to 
make it easier for health care providers to report serious 
adverse events and to clarify what type of information should be 
reported. The agency believes that preserving the 
confidentiality of the identities of the patient and of third 
parties involved with an adverse event report, such as the 
physician or others identified in the report, is essential to the 
success of the adverse event reporting system. Accordingly, 
although the substantive content of adverse event reports is 
public information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 
U.S.C. 552, FDA regulations have long protected the 
confidentiality of the patient, reporter, and institution 
involved in the adverse event ( 20.111 (21 CFR 20.111)). These 
regulations, which have been in place since 1974, have enabled 
FDA to obtain voluntary reports of adverse events and to protect 
the confidentiality of information that could identify the 
patient involved. 
Although these regulations protect the release of 
confidential information by FDA, they do not protect the release 
of the same information contained in reports held by drug, 
biologic, and device manufacturers. Various State and local 
governments have laws, regulations, or rules that permit 
disclosure of this information in litigation, through discovery 
or otherwise. Recently, plaintiffs in several product liability 
and medical malpractice cases have attempted to discover the 
identities of reporters and patients named in adverse event 
reports in the possession of the product manufacturers. As 
discussed above, this same information is protected from public 
disclosure when it is contained in similar or identical reports 
submitted to FDA and in FDA's possession. To avoid jeopardizing 
the willingness of the health care community to make reports of 
adverse events to manufacturers and FDA, the agency believes that 
a similar confidentiality rule is needed to prevent disclosure or 
threats of disclosure of the identity of reporters or subjects of 
adverse event reports in the possession of manufacturers. 
To ensure meaningful reporting under the new MEDWATCH 
program, FDA believes that additional steps must be taken to 
safeguard the confidentiality of the identities of those involved 
with adverse event reports. State and local laws, regulations, 
or rules that permit or require the disclosure of patient and 
reporters' identities interfere with the agency's objective of 
ensuring the safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices. 
Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend its regulations to prohibit 
the disclosure of such information contained in reports held by 
FDA, as provided currently, and similar information held by 
manufacturers. The proposal also would preempt State and local 
laws, regulations, or rules that permit or require such 
disclosure. Disclosure would be permitted if both the reporter 
and the person identified in the report consent to disclosure or 
if there is a discovery order in malpractice litigation between 
the subject of the report and the reporter of the adverse event. 


B. FDA Adverse Event Reporting Programs 


1. Drug and Non-Vaccine Biological Products 


FDA receives postmarketing adverse drug reaction (ADR) 
reports directly from manufacturers, health professionals, and 
consumers. An adverse drug or biologic experience means any 
adverse event associated with the use of the product in humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the
drug or 
biologic. Included are events that occur in the course of 
professional use, from drug overdose (whether intentional or 
accidental), from drug abuse, from drug withdrawal, and any 
failure of an expected pharmacological action ( 314.80 (21 CFR 
314.80(a)). 
FDA regulations require drug manufacturers to report to FDA 
serious and unexpected adverse reactions and increased frequency 
of serious expected reactions. These reports must be filed 
within a specific time after the manufacturer receives the 
information. Manufacturers are also required to submit periodic 
reports of all adverse reactions ( 314.80). FDA has proposed 
similar adverse experience reporting requirements for 
manufacturers of licensed biological products (March 29, 1990, 55 
FR 11611) and expects to publish final regulations in the near 
future. The reporting of these adverse reactions by health 
professionals to either manufacturers or FDA, however, is 
strictly voluntary. (Health care providers are required to 
report certain adverse events associated with specific vaccines 
under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. See section 
I.B.3 of this document.) The agency is also preparing a proposed 
rule to require adverse drug reaction reporting by manufacturers 
of nonprescription drug products.

<TEXT>
 

In 1992, the agency received 105,945 ADR reports. The majority of the reports (88 percent) were sent by manufacturers,
while the remaining 12 percent were sent directly to FDA by health professionals or consumers. Of all the ADR reports
received by the agency, 22,704 were considered serious. 
FDA believes that these figures represent only a fraction of the serious adverse events encountered by health care
providers. A recent review article found that between 3 and 11 percent of hospital admissions could be attributed
to adverse drug reactions (Ref. 1). Only about 1 percent of serious events are reported to FDA, according to one study
(Ref. 2). Another study states that reporting rates in the United States are apparently lower than those in some other
countries (Ref. 3). The majority of studies that have investigated the occurrence of adverse drug events in hospitalized
patients estimate that from 10 to 20 percent of all patients will experience an adverse drug event while hospitalized
(Ref. 4). 
Upon receipt of the ADR report, the agency enters the information into its computerized data base of all ADR reports,
the spontaneous reporting system (SRS). Every report of a serious adverse reaction is evaluated for its potential
significance. The agency determines whether similar incidences were reported in the SRS, the temporal relationship
between the administration of the drug and the reaction, possible confounding factors, and other information related
to the adverse event. In many cases, follow-up information is requested from the reporter or the manufacturer. Because
of resource constraints, the agency often relies on the manufacturer to screen the ADR reports and conduct any necessary
follow-up by contacting the reporter. For this reason, similar or identical reports of adverse drug events will be
in the possession of both FDA and individual drug manufacturers. 
Information provided by voluntary reports from health professionals alerted FDA that the recently approved antibiotic
temafloxacin (Omniflox) was associated with a serious type of anemia. Because of the severity of the risk associated
with this drug, which became apparent only after the product was approved and used in larger numbers of patients, it
was removed from the market. ADR reporting from health professionals also prompted FDA to undertake research that
showed that a fatal reaction could occur when the antihistamine terfenadine (Seldane) is taken in combination with
the antifungal ketoconazole (Nizoral) or with the antibiotic erythromycin. Drug interactions also reflect the
fact that individual variability in drug metabolism can account for significant differences in patient response.
Such response differences make well-designed postmarketing studies and health care provider observations and
reports especially important. Other examples of FDA actions prompted by ADR reports include: The alert that serious
liver damage may be associated with labetalol, a drug for high blood pressure; the recall of the nonnarcotic pain relieving
drug zomepirac (Zomax), after reports that it may cause a severe allergic reaction that can result in death; the alert
that the use of the antibiotics in the fluoroquinolone class and the anticoagulant warfarin may result in increased
blood clotting time, which can lead to hemorrhage; and the recent boxed warning and alert to health professionals
regarding the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.



2. Devices 


Postmarketing surveillance of the safety of devices depends on the success of both required and voluntary systems
of reporting. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976
(Pub. L. 94-295) (the 1976 amendments) (21 U.S.C. 360i) and the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-629)
(the SMDA) (21 U.S.C. 360i(e)), and regulations thereunder, require manufacturers and distributors of devices
to submit reports to FDA, within a specific timeframe, of deaths and serious injuries related to certain devices and
of malfunctions. The SMDA also requires device user facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient
treatment centers, to report to FDA and the manufacturer, within a certain timeframe, information that reasonably
suggests that a device has or may have caused a death. Device user facilities also are required to report to the manufacturer,
or to FDA if the manufacturer is unknown, information that reasonably suggests that a device has caused, or may have
caused, or may have contributed to a serious illness or serious injury. 
Since 1973, the agency has maintained a voluntary device problem reporting program. Last year, about 4,500 reports
were voluntarily submitted to this program, in addition to the statutorily required reports from manufacturers,
distributors, and user facilities. Both the voluntary and the statutorily required reporting systems for devices,
as with those for drugs, ultimately depend on the willingness of the individual health care professionals to submit
reports. 
In 1991, voluntary reporting led the agency to alert health professionals to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity
to latex products. In addition, through the voluntary reporting system, FDA learned of increased numbers of deaths
associated with physical patient restraints, often used by hospitals and nursing homes to restrain patients. Based
on these reports and other information, FDA has restricted patient restraint devices to prescription use only and
has taken steps to ensure proper labeling to prevent deaths and injuries. After receiving a report by a physician about
two patients who experienced blindness after the physician's use of an ophthalmic device during eye surgery, FDA
investigated the manufacturer and initiated a recall to remove these devices from the market. 
In some areas, however, inadequate reporting has fostered delays in detecting problems. One example is silicone
breast implants. Although these devices had been on the market for over 30 years, only in recent years had evidence
begun to accumulate about their possible association with autoimmune-like disorders. Had the agency received reports
from health care providers when they initially observed these disorders in patients with breast implants, the agency
could have assessed this possible association at an earlier date.

3. Vaccines 


The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the NCVIA) requires health care providers who administer certain
vaccines and manufacturers of those vaccines to report to the Government specified adverse events (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25).
All reports are made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is maintained by FDA and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). FDA strongly encourages health care providers to report all suspected
adverse events related to vaccines, in addition to those required to be reported by law, to VAERS. Reports submitted
to VAERS are evaluated by FDA and CDC to identify vaccine-specific incidence and adverse event trends. For reports
made pursuant to the NCVIA, the identity of the patient or the patient's legal representative cannot be made available
to the public. However, for such reports, the identity of the health care provider is available to the public (42 U.S.C.
300aa-25(c)). For vaccine adverse event reports not submitted pursuant to the NCVIA, for example, for vaccines other
than certain childhood vaccines, the identities of the patient, reporter, and institution involved are not disclosed
to the public under FOIA. 


4. The MEDWATCH Program 


The goal of FDA's new MEDWATCH program is to underscore the important role of health care providers in identifying
and reporting serious adverse events that may be related to FDA- regulated products. The program will make it easier
for health care providers to report adverse events, clarify the type of reports that should be made, more widely disseminate
information on FDA actions that have resulted from adverse event reporting, and increase physician awareness of
drug- and device-induced disease. 
Under the MEDWATCH program, several separate forms previously used to report adverse events and product problems
with various products have been consolidated into a single, one page reporting form. Health professionals can use
this form for reports on drug products, biological products, devices, and special nutritional products (dietary
supplements, medical foods, and infant formula). The unified reporting form will be more readily available to providers
in several publications and from a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week toll free number operated by FDA. There is also now a single
receipt point for these reports; no longer will providers be expected to send different reports for medications and
devices to different places in FDA. Health professionals can send the reports to the agency via facsimile or can report
electronically by computer, responding to questions that appear on the monitor's screen. Health professionals
can also send reports to manufacturers, who in turn will transmit them to FDA. Device manufacturers, user facilities,
and distributors subject to mandatory reporting requirements will continue to submit their reports as specified
in the applicable regulation. 
The important message of the MEDWATCH program is that health professionals should report any event that is suspected
to be related to an FDA-regulated product and is associated with a serious outcome such as death, a life-threatening
condition, initial or prolonged hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, or an event that requires intervention
to prevent permanent impairment or damage. The object is to capture as many reports of serious adverse events as possible
in order to use that information to enhance the safety of FDA-regulated products. In general, the agency does not care
whether the voluntary report goes directly to FDA or to the manufacturer_as long as the event is reported. 
Many segments of the health care community have long supported agency efforts to increase voluntary reporting of
adverse events by professionals. The practice standards for the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists contain
a statement that ``pharmacists in organized health-care settings should develop ongoing programs for monitoring
and reporting ADRs'' and should ``[r]eport serious or unexpected ADRs to FDA'' (Ref. 5). The Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has standards for monitoring and reporting adverse medication and device events
(Ref. 6). These standards require hospitals to report unexpected or significant adverse reactions promptly to FDA
and to the manufacturer. 
To further support FDA's voluntary MEDWATCH program, the American Medical Association's (AMA) Council on Ethical
and Judicial Affairs recently released an opinion memorandum in 1993 that it is a physician's ethical responsibility
and obligation to communicate any suspect occurrence of an adverse reaction to a drug or device to the medical community,
including FDA.

II. The Problem_Confidentiality of Reporters' Identities
 


FDA believes that its success in encouraging health 
professionals to participate in the voluntary adverse event 
reporting system depends substantially on the guarantee of 
confidentiality given the identity of the reporter under FDA 
regulations (  20.111(c)(3), 314.430(e)(4), 601.51(e)(3), and 
803.9(b)). When FDA receives a request from the public for 
adverse reaction reports submitted voluntarily by health care 
professionals, consumers, patients, or manufacturers, FDA 
regulations require public disclosure of those reports only after 
deletion of the following: (1) The names and any information 
that would identify the person using the product, and (2) the 
names and any information that would identify any third party 
involved with the report, such as a physician, hospital, or other 
institution ( 20.111). 

The rationale for this policy was first articulated in the 


Federal Register

 of December 24, 1974, in the preamble to FDA's 
public information regulations. At that time, FDA determined 
that without a guarantee of confidentiality, ``the possibility of 
persuading health professionals voluntarily to submit adverse 
reaction information is substantially diminished, and indeed 
perhaps wholly destroyed'' (39 FR 44602 at 44616). 

In the SMDA amendments, Congress provided some additional 
protection from involvement in private civil lawsuits to 
physicians who submit voluntary reports concerning adverse device 
events. Section 519(b)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i(b)(3)), 
added by the SMDA, provides that: 




[n]o report made under [the device user 
facility requirements] by a physician who is 
not required to make such a report, shall be 
admissible into evidence or otherwise used in 
any action involving private parties unless 
the facility, individual, or physician who 
made the report had knowledge of the falsity 
of the information contained in the report. 




Congress enacted this provision to encourage private physicians 
to notify FDA or the manufacturer of device problems (H. Rept. 
808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 21 (1990)). This provision, however, 
may not be sufficient to prevent manufacturers from being 
compelled to release the reporters' or patients' identities 
pursuant to a discovery order. 



The policy and program considerations underlying the need to 
protect patient and reporter confidentiality have become even 
more compelling in recent years. The increase in product 
liability and medical malpractice litigation has heightened the 
reluctance of health professionals to report events observed by 
them if they are not given meaningful promises of 
confidentiality. In addition, the potential for discrimination 
connected with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive status or acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) has strengthened the commitment of health care professionals to 
protect patient privacy. As a direct reflection of FDA's 
longstanding regulations and commitment to this policy, the 
agency's MEDWATCH form (and its predecessors) expressly states 
that the information identifying the patient and reporter is held 
in confidence (see 58 FR 31611 through 31612, June 3, 1993). 

However, in connection with FDA's current efforts to promote 
the MEDWATCH program and to increase reporting of serious adverse 
events, the health care community has voiced concerns about the 
agency's ability to safeguard confidentiality and protect the 
identities of the reporter and patient identified in the report, 
especially in situations where the report is in the possession of 
an individual manufacturer. Despite FDA's longstanding policy of 
keeping these identities confidential, the current concerns 
threaten to undermine the success of the voluntary reporting 
program. 

FDA published its draft uniform MEDWATCH form for reporting 
suspect adverse events and product problems on February 26, 1993 
(58 FR 11768). Subsequently, the agency received several 
comments about FDA's ability to maintain the confidentiality of 
patient and reporter identities: (1) When the report of an 
adverse event is made directly to the manufacturer or (2) when 
the manufacturer receives the information from FDA after a report 
is made to the agency. 

The MEDWATCH form permits individuals reporting directly to 
the agency to indicate that they do not want their identity 
disclosed to the manufacturer. However, the agency encourages 
reporters to allow the agency to share the reporter's identity 
with the manufacturer in order to help FDA and the manufacturer 
conduct necessary followup. Currently, State and local laws 
govern disclosure of information from adverse event report forms 
that are in the possession of manufacturers, whether the reports 
come directly to the manufacturer from reporters or are relayed 
to manufacturers by FDA. Some State and local laws allow or 
require disclosure of identities of reporters and patients in 
adverse event reports.

FDA believes that if the identities of reporters or patients 
were made public or available to third parties, health care 
professionals would be much more reluctant to submit voluntary 
adverse event reports for fear of involving themselves and their 
patients in litigation. It is well recognized that many 
physicians are concerned about the potential for involvement in 
litigation by their patients or third parties. In a 1992 survey 
of physicians regarding adverse event reporting, over 37 percent 
of the respondents agreed with the statement that reporting 
increases the risk of becoming involved in litigation; 18 percent 
of the respondents listed fear of becoming involved in the 
administrative or legal process as an important reason for not 
reporting adverse reactions (Ref. 7). Several other surveys 
have been conducted which asked physicians what factors 
influenced their decision not to report an adverse event (Refs. 8, 9, and 10). Between 8 and 14 percent of the respondents
in 
the studies stated that concern over legal liability was one 
reason why they did not report an adverse event. Moreover, if 
the reporter is a health care professional, particularly a 
physician, the reporter may fear that disclosure of his or her 
identity would increase the chances that a patient's identity 
would be discovered, thus risking a breach of the confidential 
physician-patient relationship. 

In recent years FDA has learned of a number of product 
liability lawsuits in State courts in which manufacturers have 
been requested or ordered to provide the names of persons 
reporting adverse reactions to particular products. In some 
instances, the names of the affected patients have been 
requested. The manufacturers involved in these cases vigorously 
opposed discovery requests that sought the disclosure of patient 
and reporter identities. Occasionally, when the disclosure issue 
was being litigated, the manufacturers requested that FDA 
formally express its views on the disclosure of these identities 
and the effects such disclosure might have on the agency's 
postmarketing surveillance program. 

FDA firmly believes that the success of its postmarketing 
surveillance efforts is dependent upon protecting the 
confidentiality of individuals involved in adverse experience 
reports. Thus, FDA took the unusual step of becoming involved 
in a number of these cases by filing, with the assistance of the Department of Justice, a statement of the Federal government's

interest. The statement informed the courts of the potential 
damage the agency believes would be done to its postmarketing 
surveillance program and the public health if the identities of 
patients and reporters were released to plaintiffs in these 
cases. The agency believes that its efforts have contributed to 
continued protection of reporter and patient identities in all 
the cases in which FDA has participated. 



III. The Need for Federal Regulation 



FDA has determined that in order to help assure beneficial 
and consistent reporting of adverse events to the agency's 
MEDWATCH program, State and local rules that would permit or 
require disclosure of the identities of reporters and patients 
named in the reports must be clearly preempted by FDA's amended 
regulation. 

Laws that permit disclosure of the identities of health 
professional reporters or patients identified in the reports 
directly interfere with FDA's ability to collect information 
required under sections 505(k) and 519 of the act (21 U.S.C. 
355(k) and 360i). Section 505(k) requires manufacturers to 
submit information about approved drug products in order to 
enable FDA to monitor the safety of the product and ``facilitate a 
determination'' of whether the drug should be withdrawn from the 
market. This provision is implemented in  314.80 (21 CFR 
314.80) of the FDA regulations, which establishes mandatory 
reporting requirements of adverse reactions for manufacturers of 
drugs.

Section 519 of the act requires device manufacturers, 
distributors, importers, and user facilities to submit to FDA 
reports of certain adverse events to ensure the safety and 
effectiveness of devices. FDA has implemented this provision in 
regulations establishing mandatory reporting requirements for 
manufacturers, importers, and distributors (21 CFR part 803). 
FDA also has proposed regulations establishing reporting 
requirements for user facilities (see the 

Federal Register

 of 
November 26, 1991 (56 FR 60024)). 
Under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 262(d)), biological products are licensed in accordance 
with regulations ``designed to insure the continued safety, 
purity, and potency'' of these products. Under FDA's implementing 
regulations, a biological product license may be revoked if the 
product does not conform to applicable standards or is not safe 
and effective (21 CFR 601.5(b)). The agency's proposed biologics 
adverse experience reporting regulations would establish 
mandatory reporting requirements for manufacturers of most 
biological products (see the 

Federal Register

 of March 29, 1990 
(55 FR 11611)). 
Although these reporting requirements are or will be mandatory for manufacturers, device distributors, and device
user facilities, these required reports ultimately rely upon voluntary reporting by health professionals. Manufacturers
cannot report adverse events if they do not find out about them from the health professionals who observed or were advised
of the events. As stated in section II. of this document, disclosure of patient or reporter identities serves as a significant
disincentive for voluntary reporting by health professionals. Preempting State and local disclosure laws and rules
that permit or require such disclosure would remove a significant impediment to FDA's ability to implement postmarketing
surveillance programs that are essential to the public health. 
Furthermore, sections 505(k) and 519 of the act provide that regulations and orders issued with respect to postmarketing
reporting requirements ``shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests
of patients * * *'' (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360i). The confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship
is a basic tenet of medical ethics. The AMA Code of Ethics requires that, with certain limited exceptions, ``(t)he
utmost effort and care must be taken to protect the confidentiality of all medical records'' (``1992 Code of Medical
Ethics, Annotated Current Opinions,'' Section 5.07; and see the ``1991 Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice of
the American Nursing Association''). The recent AMA opinion that physicians have an ethical obligation to report
adverse drug or device events is likely to be incorporated in medical practice if confidentiality can be ensured (Ref.
11). 
FDA firmly believes that the public health interest in securing information from health professionals about potential
hazards associated with marketed products far outweighs the interest an individual plaintiff may assert to obtain
reporters' identities in private tort actions. 
FDA recognizes the sophistication and complexity of private tort litigation in the United States and the proposed
preemption action is not intended to frustrate or impede tort litigation in this area. Indeed, FDA recognizes that
product liability plays an important role in consumer protection. The proposed regulation has been drafted to permit
any individual plaintiff who experienced an adverse event and subsequently has become involved in medical malpractice
litigation with the person who reported the event to obtain all the information contained in the adverse event report.
In this situation, where both parties to the litigation know each other's identities, the interests of the parties
in protecting this information is minimized and, therefore, would not impose a significant disincentive to reporting.

IV. Legal Authority for Federal Preemption 


A. Principles of Preemption Law 


Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, State law may be preempted by Federal law in a number of ways (U.S. Const.,
Art. VI, cl. 2.). Congress may preempt State law by so stating in express terms (

Jones 

v. 

Rath Packing Co.,

 430 U.S. 519 (1977)). Section 521 of the act contains an express preemption provision applicable to devices. Under
that section, no State may establish a requirement for a device ``different from, or in addition to'' any requirement
applicable to the device under the act relating to safety or effectiveness or other matter included in an applicable
requirement. (See 21 CFR part 808; 

Commonwealth of Massachusetts 

v. 

Hayes,

 691 F.2d 57 (1st Cir. 1982)). 
Even when Congress has not expressly preempted State law, congressional intent to preempt may be inferred in several
ways. Preemption may be found ``where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable
the inference that Congress `left no room' for supplementary state regulation'' (

Hillsborough County 

v. 

Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 

471 U.S. 707, 713 (1985), quoting 

Rice 

v. 

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,

 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)), or where ``the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to
preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject'' (

Rice 

v. 

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,

 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947); see 

Hines 

v. 

Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. 52 (1941)). 
Another way the courts infer a congressional intent to preempt is by determining that State law actually conflicts
with Federal law. The conflict may be demonstrated either when ``compliance with both federal and state [law] is a
physical impossibility'' (

Florida Lime and Avocado Growers, Inc. 

v. 

Paul, 

373 U.S. 132, 142-43 (1963)), or when State law ``stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of
the full purpose and objectives of Congress'' (

Hines 

v. 

Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. at 67). State law is also preempted if it interferes with the methods by which a Federal law is designed to reach
its goals. (See 

International Paper Co. 

v. 

Ouellette, 

479 U.S. 481, 494 (1987); 

Michigan Canners & Freezers Ass'n 

v. 

Agricultural Marketing & Bargaining Bd., 

467 U.S. 461, 477 (1984).) 
In addition to the various ways in which preemption may result from congressional action or intent, ```a federal agency
acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may preempt state regulation' and hence render
unenforceable state or local laws that are otherwise not inconsistent with federal law'' (

City of New York 

v. 

FCC, 

486 U.S. 57, 63-64 (1988), (quoting 

Louisiana Public Service Comm'n 

v. 

FCC, 

476 U.S. 355, 368-69 (1986))). Express congressional authorization for an agency to preempt State law is not
needed and ``federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes.'' (

Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Assn 

v. 

de la Cuesta, 

458 U.S. 141, 153, 154 (1982)). 
When an agency's intent to preempt is clearly and unambiguously stated, the Court's inquiry will be whether the preemptive
action is within the scope of that agency's delegated authority (

Capital Cities Cable, Inc. 

v. 

Crisp, 

467 U.S. 691, 700 (1984); 

Fidelity Federal Savings, 

458 U.S. at 154). If the agency's choice to preempt ``represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies
that were committed to the agency's care by statute [the regulation will stand unless] it appears from statute or its
legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned'' (

United States 

v. 

Shimer, 

367 U.S. 374, 383 (1961)). In 

Hillsborough County, 

the Court stated that FDA possessed the authority to promulgate regulations preempting local laws that compromise
the supply of plasma and could do so (

Hillsborough County, 

471 U.S. at 721). FDA believes it has similar authority to preempt local rules that compromise adverse reporting systems
that are essential to postmarketing surveillance and protection of the public health. 


B. Conflicts Between State Disclosure Laws and Federal Law 


The conflicts between State and local disclosure laws and Federal law on reporting of adverse events justify FDA's
preemption of these laws. Although Congress did not expressly preempt State law in this area, the agency's action
is appropriate because State and local laws significantly interfere with the methods by which the Federal law is designed
to achieve its goals.

<TEXT>
 

FDA is the Government agency charged with protecting citizens by helping to ensure that medical products, including
human drugs, biologics, and devices, are safe and effective for their intended uses. To further this purpose, Congress
established elaborate mechanisms for the Federal government to permit marketing of new drugs, biologics, and devices
and to monitor the safety of these products after approval (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360; 42 U.S.C. 262). Pursuant to these
statutory provisions, FDA has established an extensive regulatory scheme to monitor the safety and effectiveness
of new human drugs, biologics, and devices (  310.305, 314.80, and   803.1 through 803.36).


State and local rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and other laws and regulations that permit discovery
of the reporters' and patients' identities are an obstacle to accomplishing this goal. Moreover, with respect to
devices, such laws, regulations, and rules are different from the confidentiality requirements under the act and
FDA regulations that implement adverse event reporting under section 519 of the act. Although reporter identities
in voluntary adverse event reports contained in FDA records are not subject to discovery in State litigation, those
reports that are in the possession of the manufacturer may be subject to State or local disclosure laws. The possibility
of such disclosure will chill the willingness of reporters to share information with FDA, which may share details
about a report with a manufacturer in order to investigate the report further. Preemption of State and local disclosure
laws will remove an inhibiting influence on health professionals and will increase adverse event reporting. FDA
has determined that such increased reporting outweighs the individual needs of plaintiffs to obtain information
about the reporters and subjects of adverse reaction reports that are not about the plaintiff.


The proposed regulation is narrowly drawn and focuses solely on protecting the identity of the reporter and patient
and other individuals identified in the report. This proposed rule does not preempt State and local laws that require
disclosure of the substance of adverse event reports. The agency does not believe that disclosure of the substance
of the adverse event reports will impede its ability to collect this information. Indeed, FDA routinely releases
the full substance of all voluntary adverse event reports to requestors after deletion of patient, reporter, and
institution identities ( 20.111(c)(3)(iii)). Nor will the regulation impede the ability of an individual
plaintiff to obtain specific information about reports concerning his or her own reaction to a product when that plaintiff
is involved in a medical malpractice lawsuit and a court grants discovery of records directly concerning the plaintiff.

V. Summary of the Proposed Rule 



FDA's rule to preempt State and local laws, rules, regulations or other requirements that would permit the disclosure
of the identity of health care professionals who report adverse events associated with FDA regulated products and
the identity of patients and other individuals named in those reports would be codified in newly proposed  20.63(f).


Proposed  20.63(f) would provide that the names and any identifying information, including the address of
the reporter or the name or address of the institution, that would lead to the identification of the reporter or the
persons named in a voluntary adverse event report, shall not be disclosed by either FDA or a manufacturer in possession
of such report in response to any request. 

Proposed  20.63(f)(1) would provide exceptions to the prohibition of disclosing the names if both the reporter
and the person identified in the adverse event report consent to disclosure of their identities, or if there is a court
order in a medical malpractice action involving both the person named in the report and the reporter. Proposed  20.63(f)(1)(iii)
would permit disclosure of an adverse event report to the individual who is the subject of the report upon request.



Proposed  20.63(f)(2) explicitly states that no State or local entity shall establish or continue in effect
any law, rule, regulation or other requirement that permits or requires the disclosure of the identities of the reporter
or person identified in an adverse event report except as provided in this rule. 



VI. Executive Order 12612: Federalism 



FDA has examined the effects of this proposal on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, as
required by Executive Order 12612 on ``Federalism.'' The agency concludes that preemption of State or local rules
that permit disclosure of the identities of the voluntary reporter or persons identified in an adverse event report
for human drugs, biologics, and devices is consistent with this Executive Order. 

Executive Order 12612 recognizes that Federal action limiting the discretion of State and local governments is appropriate
``where constitutional authority for the action is clear and certain and the national activity is necessitated by
the presence of a problem of national scope (section 3(b)). The constitutional basis for FDA's authority to regulate
the safety and efficacy of human drugs, biologics, and devices is beyond challenge. Congress' decision to vest FDA
with the responsibility to establish a regulatory scheme to monitor the safety of these products demonstrates Congress'
view that the safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices is a problem of national scope (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 42 U.S.C.
262)). 

Executive Order 12612 expressly contemplates preemption where there is a conflict of State and Federal authority
under Federal statute (section 4(a)). State and local rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and other rules
and regulations that permit or require disclosure of the identities of those who report adverse events associated
with human drugs, biologics, and devices are an obstacle to fulfilling FDA's charge to monitor the safety and efficacy
of these products. The guarantee of confidentiality of the reporters' and patients' identities is necessary to assure
meaningful reporting of adverse events. In addition, Congress specified that Federal regulations issued to monitor
the safety of drug products ``shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests
of patients'' (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360i). State and local rules and regulations that permit disclosure of the identities
conflict with this requirement by jeopardizing confidentiality and the physician-patient relationship. 

Executive Order 12612 requires that any Federal preemption be restricted to the minimum level necessary to achieve
the objectives of the statute pursuant to which the regulations are promulgated (section 4(c)). The proposed regulation
is narrowly drawn and focuses solely on protecting the identity of the reporter and patient and other individuals
named in the report. The proposed rule does not preempt State and local laws that require disclosure of the substance
of the adverse event reports. 

As required by the Executive Order, States will be given, through this notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunity
to participate in the proceedings to preempt State and local laws (section 4(e)). In addition, pursuant to the Order,
the appropriate officials and organizations representing the States will be consulted before this proposed action
is implemented (section 3(a)). 

The agency concludes that the policy proposed in this document has been assessed in light of the principles, criteria,
and requirements in Executive Order 12612; that this policy is not inconsistent with that Order; that this policy
will not impose additional costs or burdens on the States; and that this policy will not affect the States' ability
to discharge traditional State governmental functions.

VII. Economic Impact



FDA has considered the economic impact of this proposed rule and concludes that it would impose no additional costs
on industry or the general public. The value to an individual litigant of having the identities of reporters and subjects
of adverse experiences is difficult to estimate; however, litigants will have available the substance of adverse
experience reports, which is of greater importance. Although tort litigation could provide substantial economic
benefit to an individual litigant, the net gain to health care and public health through efficient and complete reporting
of serious adverse reactions greatly outweighs any damage an individual litigant may suffer from lack of access to
the names of patients or reporters who are not parties in the litigant's lawsuit. Accordingly, FDA concludes that
this proposed rule is not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866 and certifies that this proposed rule would
not have a substantial economic effect on a significant number of small entities which would require a regulatory
flexibility analysis under the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. 



VIII. Environmental Impact
 


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this rulemaking action is to revise the ``General Forestry Regulations'' to implement the provisions
of the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act. 



The law reaffirmed many aspects of the existing Indian forestry program and established new program direction for
cooperative agreements between the Department of the Interior and Indian tribes, forest trespass, Secretarial
recognition of tribal laws pertaining to Indian forest lands, Indian forestry program assessments, Indian forest
land assistance accounts, tribal forestry programs, Alaska Native technical assistance and forestry education
assistance. 

The proposed rule establishes uniform Indian forestry program operating policy that complies with the National
Indian Forest Resources Management Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed rule has been developed with full participation and consultation of the affected Indian and Alaska Native
public. Prior to drafting the proposed rule, public scoping meetings were announced and held in Minneapolis, Portland,
Phoenix and Anchorage in February and March, 1991. Input from those meetings was considered and addressed in the proposed
rule. Additional consultation with the affected public was accomplished by maintaining close communication with
the Intertribal Timber Council (ITC) during the rule drafting process and including ITC members on the project steering
committee and project in working groups. 



This proposed rule is published in exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant
Secretary_Indian Affairs by 208 DM 8. 

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the locations identified in the addresses section of this document. 

This document has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

The information collection requirements contained in this part do not require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

The primary author of this document is Mr. Jim Stires, Forester, in the Billings Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Branch of Forestry, Billings, Montana.

objectives: 

(1) The development, maintenance and enhancement of Indian forest land in a perpetually productive state in accordance
with the principles of sustained yield and with the standards and objectives set forth in forest management plans
by providing effective management and protection through the application of sound silvicultural and economic principles
to the harvesting of forest products, forestation, timber stand improvement and other forestry practices;

Forest management planning and sustained yield management. 




(a) To further the objectives identified in  163.3, an appropriate forest management plan shall be prepared
and revised as needed. Such documents shall contain a statement describing the manner in which the policies of the
tribe and the Secretary will be applied, with a definite plan of silvicultural management, analysis of the short term
and long term effects of the plan, and a program of action, including a harvest schedule, for a specified period in the
future. Forest management plans shall be based on the principle of sustained yield management and objectives established
by the tribe and will require approval of the Secretary. 


(b) Forest management planning for Indian forest land shall be carried out through participation in the development
and implementation of integrated resource management plans which provide coordination for the comprehensive management
of all natural resources on Indian land. If the integrated resource management planning process has not been initiated,
or is not ongoing or completed, a stand-alone forest management plan will be prepared. 


(c) The harvest of forest products from Indian forest land will be accomplished under the principles of sustained
yield management and will not be authorized until practical methods of harvest based on sound economic and silvicultural
and other forest management principles have been prescribed. Harvest schedules will be prepared for a specified

interest on individually owned lands. Open market sales of forest products from Indian land located off reservations
will be permitted with the consent of the Secretary and majority Indian interest of the beneficial owner(s). 


(b) On Indian forest land not formally designated for retention in its natural state, the Secretary may sell the forest
products without the consent of the owner(s) when in his or her judgment such action is necessary to prevent loss of
value resulting from fire, insects, diseases, windthrow or other catastrophes. 


(c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each sale of forest products having an estimated stumpage value
exceeding $15,000 will not be approved until: 


(1) An examination of the forest products to be sold has been made by a forest officer; and

after advertising. 


(a) The advertisement shall be approved by the officer who will approve the instrument of sale. Advertised sales shall
be made under sealed bids, or at public auction, or under a combination thereof. The advertisement may limit sales
of Indian forest products to Indian forest enterprises, members of the tribe, or may grant to Indian forest enterprises
and/or members of the tribe who submitted bids the right to meet the higher bid of a non-member. If the estimated stumpage
value of the forest products offered does not exceed $15,000, the advertisement may be made by posters and circular
letters. If the estimated stumpage value exceeds $15,000, the advertisement shall also be made in at least one edition
of a newspaper of general circulation in the locality where the forest products are situated. If the estimated stumpage
value does not exceed $50,000, the advertisement shall be made for not less than 15 days; if the estimated stumpage
value exceeds $50,000 but not $250,000, for not less than 30 days; and if the estimated stumpage value exceeds $250,000,
for not less than 60 days. 


(b) The approving officer may reduce the advertising period because of emergencies such as fire, insect attack, blowdown,
limitation of time, or when there would be no practical advantage in advertising for the prescribed period. 


(c) If no instrument of sale is executed after such advertisement, the approving officer may, within one year from
the last day on which bids were to be received as defined in the advertisement, permit the sale of such forest products.
The sale will be made upon the terms and conditions in the advertisement and at not less than the advertised value or
the appraised value at the time of sale, whichever is greater.

 163.25 

Forest management deductions.


(a) Pursuant to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 413 and 25 U.S.C. 3105, a forest management deduction shall be withheld
from the gross proceeds of sales of forest products harvested from Indian forest land as described in this section.
(b) Gross proceeds shall mean the value in money or money's worth of consideration furnished by the purchaser of forest
products purchased under a contract, permit, or other document for the sale of forest products.
(c) Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where:
(1) The total consideration furnished under a contract, permit or other document for the sale of forest products is
less than $5,001; or
(2) The monies collected are derived from trespass, defaulted contracts or other civil judgments.
(d) Except as provided in  163.25(e), the amount of the forest management deduction shall not exceed the lesser
amount of ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds or, the actual percentage in effect on November 28, 1990.
(e) The Secretary shall increase the forest management deduction percentage for Indian forest land upon receipt
of a written request from a tribe supported by a resolution executed by the authorized tribal representatives. At
the request of the authorized tribal representatives and at the discretion of the Secretary the forest management
deduction percentage may be decreased to not less than one percent (1%) or the requirement for collection may be waived.
(f) Forest management deductions are to be utilized to perform forest land management activities in accordance with
an approved expenditure plan. Expenditure plans shall describe the forest land management activities anticipated
to be undertaken, establish a time period for their completion, summarize anticipated obligations and expenditures,
and specify the method through which funds are to be transferred or credited to tribal accounts from special deposit
accounts established to hold amounts withheld as forest management deductions. Any forest management deductions
that have not been incorporated into an approved expenditure plan by the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal
year in which the deductions are withheld, shall be collected into the general funds of the United States Treasury
pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 413.

(1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a written expenditure plan for the use of forest management
deductions shall be prepared annually and approved by the authorized tribal representative(s) and the Secretary.
The approval of the expenditure plan by the authorized tribal representatives constitutes appropriation of tribal
funds for Indian forest land management activities. Approval of the expenditure plan by the Secretary shall constitute
authority for crediting of forest management deductions to tribal account(s). The full amount of any deduction collected
by the Secretary plus any income or interest earned thereon shall be available for expenditure according to the approved
expenditure plan for the performance of forest land management activities on the reservation from which the forest
management deduction is collected.
(2) For Indian forest lands located outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation, forest management deductions
shall be handled in a manner similar to that described under  163.25(f)(1) if the expenditure plan approved
by an Indian tribe and the Secretary provides for the conduct of forest land management activities on such lands.
(3) For public domain and Alaska Native allotments held in trust for Indians by the United States, forest management
deductions may be utilized to perform forest land management activities on such lands in accordance with an expenditure
plan approved by the Secretary.
(g) Forest management deductions withheld pursuant to this section shall not be available to cover the costs that
are paid from funds appropriated for fire suppression or pest control or otherwise offset Federal appropriations
for meeting the Federal trust responsibility for management of Indian forest land.
(h) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the tribal fiscal year, tribes shall submit to the Secretary
a written report detailing the actual expenditure of forest management deductions during the past fiscal year. The
Secretary shall have the right to inspect accounts, books or other tribal records supporting the report.
(i) Forest management deductions incorporated into an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary shall remain available
until expended.

shall be credited to any Federal appropriation. No other forest management deductions or fees derived from Indian
forest land shall be collected to be covered into the general funds of the United States Treasury.


 163.26 

Forest product harvesting permits.


(a) Except as provided in   163.13 and 163.27, removal of forest products that are not under formal contract,
pursuant to  163.19, shall be under forest product harvesting permit forms approved by the Secretary. Permits
will be issued only with the written consent of the Indian owner(s) or the Secretary, for harvest of forest products
from Indian forest land, as authorized in  163.20. To be valid, permits must be approved by the Secretary. Minimum
stumpage rates at which forest products may be sold will be set at the time consent to issue the permit is obtained. Payment
and bonding requirements will be stipulated in the permit document as appropriate.
(b) Free use harvesting permits issued shall specify species and types of forest products to be removed. It may be stipulated
that forest products removed under this authority cannot be sold or exchanged for other goods or services. The estimated
value which may be harvested in a fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed $5,000. For the
purpose of issuance of free use permits, individual shall mean an individual Indian or any organized group of Indians.
(c) Paid permits subject to forest management deductions, as provided in  163.25, may be issued. Unless otherwise
authorized by the Secretary, the stumpage value which may be harvested under paid permits in a fiscal year by any individual
under this authority shall not exceed $25,000. For the purpose of issuance of paid permits, individual shall mean
an individual or any operating entity comprised of more than one individual.
(d) A Special Allotment Timber Harvest Permit may be issued to an Indian having sole beneficial interest in an allotment
to harvest and sell designated forest products from his or her allotment. The special permit shall include provision
for payment by the Indian of forest management deductions pursuant to  163.25. Unless waived by the Secretary,
the permit shall also require the Indian to make a bond deposit with the Secretary as required by  163.21. Such
bonds will be returned to the Indian upon satisfactory completion of the permit or will be used by the Secretary in his
or her discretion for planting or other work to offset damage to the land or the timber caused by failure to comply with
the provisions of the permit. As a condition to granting a special permit under authority of this paragraph, the Indian
shall be required to provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary that he or she has arranged a bona fide sale of the
forest products, on terms that will protect the Indian's interests.


 163.27 

Free-use harvesting without permits.


With the consent of the Indian owners and the Secretary, Indians may cut designated types of forest products from Indian

(a) The Secretary is authorized to maintain facilities and staff, hire temporary labor, rent fire fighting equipment,
purchase tools and supplies, and pay for their transportation as needed, to maintain an adequate level of readiness
to meet normal wildfire protection needs and extinguish forest or range fires on Indian land. No expenses for fighting
a fire outside Indian lands may be incurred unless the fire threatens Indian land or unless the expenses are incurred
pursuant to an approved cooperative agreement with another protection agency. The rates of pay for fire fighters
and for equipment rental shall be the rates for fire fighting services that are currently in use by public and private
wildfire protection agencies adjacent to Indian reservations on which a fire occurs, unless there are in effect at
the time different rates that have been approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may also enter into reciprocal agreements
with any fire organization maintaining protection facilities in the vicinity of Indian reservations or other Indian
land for mutual aid in wildfire protection. This section does not apply to the rendering of emergency aid, or agreements
for mutual aid in fire protection pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (69 Stat. 66).
(b) The Secretary will conduct a wildfire prevention program to reduce the number of person-caused fires and to prevent
damage to natural resources on Indian land.
(c) The Secretary is authorized to expend funds for emergency rehabilitation measures needed to stabilize soil and
watershed on Indian land damaged by wildfire.
(d) Upon consultation with the beneficial Indian owners, the Secretary may use fire as a management tool on Indian
land to achieve land and/or resource management objectives.

(1) Cases in tribal court

. The measure of damages to be applied in cases of timber and related trespass in tribal court will be that prescribed
by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, unless Federal
law prescribes a different rule. Where tribal law does not supply a measure of damages, the measure shall be that prescribed
by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed, unless Federal law prescribes a different measure. 

(2) 

Cases in Federal court

. The measure of damages to be applied in cases of timber and related trespass in Federal court will be that prescribed
by Federal law. In the absence of applicable Federal law, the measure shall be that prescribed by the law of the tribe
in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed and by the law of the state in which it
was committed. 

(3) Civil penalties for trespass include: 

(i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority, willfully injures, severs, or carries off from
Indian land any tree, timber, or shrub. Proof of Indian ownership of the premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser
are prima facie evidence that the acts were committed willfully, intentionally, and without requisite consent.
Treble damages shall be based upon the fair market value of the highest-valued product obtainable from the raw materials
involved in the trespass. 

(ii) Double damages, whenever a trespasser can prove that the trespass act was casual or involuntary, or that the trespasser
had probable cause to believe that the land on which the trespass was committed was his own or that of the person in whose
service or by whose direction the act was done. Double damages shall be based upon the fair market value of the highest-valued
product obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass. 

(iii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land including, but not limited to, rehabilitation,
reforestation, lost future revenue, loss of productivity, and damage to other forest resources. 

(iv) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with
detection and including all processes through the prosecution and collection of the settlement, such as field examination
and survey, damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness expenses, demand letters, court costs,
and attorney fees. 

(b) Payment of civil penalties may involve collection of cash, forfeiture of real and personal property, and garnishment.
Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment or other goods or forest products damaged or taken
in the trespass, shall be applied to civil penalties and other expenses incurred by the enforcement agency and the
beneficial owner(s) damaged by the trespass. After disposition of real and personal property to pay civil liability
penalties and enforcement costs of the trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the event
that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the trespasser result in less than full recovery of civil penalties,
penalty damages collected will be equitably distributed among beneficial owners based on the estimate of damages
for the trespass. 

(c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or are involved in trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which
such owners have a partial interest, shall not receive damages collected as a civil penalty in consequence of the trespass.


(d) Civil penalties collected under  163.29(a) shall be treated as proceeds from the sale of forest products
from the Indian forest land upon which the trespass occurred. 

(e) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass, the agency superintendent
or such other representative of the Secretary with responsibility for the reservation may prohibit the removal of
such forest products from Indian land or have such forest products seized for safekeeping and use as evidence of trespass.
When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass and that such products have been
removed to land not under government supervision, the representative of the Secretary with responsibility for the
reservation shall immediately notify the owner of the land or the party in possession of the trespass products that
such products could be Indian trust property involved in a trespass and that no action to remove or otherwise dispose
of such products may be taken unless authorized by the Secretary. The representative of the Secretary shall cause
Indian forest products that can be positively identified to be sold where practicable to recover their value for the
beneficial Indian owners prior to deterioration. 

(f) Whenever an individual authorized to enforce against trespass activity has probable cause to believe that trespass
activity has occurred, such individual may seize and take possession of the products and/or equipment involved in
the trespass activity. All equipment seized shall be kept in the custody of the enforcement agency for use as evidence
unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The representative of the Secretary simultaneously
with any seizure shall give written notice of the seizure to the party in possession of the products and/or equipment
involved in the apparent trespass activity. Such notice shall include the statement that the seizure may be administratively
appealed pursuant to part 2 of this Title.

(g) The representative of the Secretary or the authorized tribal representative will promptly determine if a trespass
has occurred. The appropriate representative shall issue an official notice of trespass to the alleged trespasser
and, if necessary, the possessor or potential buyer of any trespass products. The notice will inform the trespasser,
buyer, or processor, that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has determined that a trespass has occurred, of the basis for
the determination, and of the seizure of forest products and/or equipment involved in trespass and that the determination
and the seizure may be administratively appealed as actions of the Bureau of Indian Affairs under part 2 of this Title.
Said representative shall post a trespass notice on the property. Any forest product seized under these procedures
may be sold or otherwise disposed of as determined appropriate by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and such action shall
not be stayed by the filing of an administrative appeal. The Secretary's and tribe's representatives will be jointly
responsible to coordinate prosecution of trespass actions and involve the appropriate officers of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and the tribe(s). Except where the Secretary defers to tribal prosecution or the tribe chooses not
to be so bound, said representatives will determine the appropriate forum(s) for prosecution of each case not administratively
settled. 

(h) The Secretary may accept payment of damages in full in the settlement of civil trespass cases without resort to
court action. In the absence of a court decision, the Secretary will determine the procedure and approve acceptance
of any negotiated settlements. 

(i) The Secretary may delegate by written agreement or contract, responsibility for detection and investigation
of forest trespass to Indian tribes. 

(j) Indian tribes that adopt the regulations set forth in this section, conformed as necessary to tribal law, shall
have concurrent civil jurisdiction to enforce section 307 of the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act
of 1990 and this section against any person. 

(1) The Secretary shall acknowledge said civil jurisdiction over trespass, upon: 

(i) Receipt of a formal tribal resolution documenting the tribe's adoption of this section; and 

(ii) Notification of the ability of the tribal court system to properly adjudicate forest trespass cases, including
a statement that the tribal court will enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act or a tribal civil rights law that contains
provisions for due process and equal protection that are similar to or stronger than those contained in the Indian
Civil Rights Act. 

(2) Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction on trespass cases as set forth in paragraph (j)(1)
of this section, the Secretary shall, upon request of the tribe, defer prosecution of forest trespasses to the tribe.
Where said deferral is not requested, the designated Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry trespass official shall coordinate
with the forest trespass official of each tribe the exercise of concurrent tribal and Federal trespass jurisdiction
as to each trespass. Such officials shall review each case, determine in which forums to recommend bringing an action,
and promptly provide their recommendation to the officials responsible for initiating cases in the selected forum(s).


(3) The Secretary may rescind deferral to prosecute civil trespass: 

(i) Upon determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the tribal court has not adhered to the due process
and equal protection requirements of the Indian Civil Rights Act in forest trespass cases, and the failure of the tribal
court to meet said requirements; or 

(ii) If no determination is forthcoming after one year from a tribal court's action in a forest trespass case that the
Secretary determines violates said requirements. 

(4) If the Secretary determines that said rescission is justified, he or she shall provide written notice to the chief
judge of the tribal judiciary of the findings justifying said rescission and of steps needed to remedy violations
of due process and/or equal protection. If said steps are not taken within 60 days, the Secretary may rescind deferral.
The affected tribe(s) may appeal a rescission under part 2 of this Title. 



 163.30

Revocable road use and construction permits for removal of commercial forest products. 



(a) The Secretary may request tribes and/or other beneficial owners to sign revocable permits designating the Secretary

(b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the Secretary may issue revocable road use and construction
permits for removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the Secretary may act for individual
owners when: 


(1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis,
and the Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, will cause no substantial injury to the
land or the owner, which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages; 


(2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or an interest therein are unknown, and the owner(s) of any interests
therein whose whereabouts are known or majority thereof, consent to the grant; 


(3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary
finds the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any owner thereof, provided that once the heirs or devisees
of the deceased owner are determined, their consent is obtained; or 


(4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the
consent of the majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will cause no substantial injury to
the land or the owner(s), which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages. 


(c) Nothing in this section shall preclude acquisition of rights-of-way over Indian lands, subchapter H, 25 CFR part
169, or conflict with provisions of that part. 



 163.31

Forest development. 




Forest development pertains to forest land management activities undertaken to improve the productivity of commercial
Indian forest land. The program shall consist of reforestation, timber stand improvement projects, and related
investments to enhance productivity of commercial forest land with emphasis on accomplishing on-the-ground projects.
Forest development funds will be used to re-establish, maintain, and/or improve growth of commercial timber species
and control stocking levels on commercial forest land. Forest development activities will be planned and executed
using benefit-cost analyses as one of the determinants in establishing priorities for project funding. 



 163.33

Administrative appeals. 




Any challenge to action taken by an approving officer or subordinate official exercising delegated authority from
the Secretary shall be exclusively through administrative appeal or as provided in the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638, as amended). Such appeal(s) shall be filed in accordance with
the provisions of 25 CFR part 2, Appeals from administrative actions, and any other applicable regulations covering
appeals and shall not stay any action unless otherwise directed by the Secretary. 



 163.34

Environmental compliance. 




Actions under the regulations in this part will be reviewed for potential environmental impacts, under the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, applicable Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, and using for guidance
applicable tribal laws and regulations.
