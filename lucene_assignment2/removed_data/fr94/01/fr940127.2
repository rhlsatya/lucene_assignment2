<DOCTITLE>Model Procedure and Practice Regulations </DOCTITLE>

ACTION:

 Notice of availability.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administrative Conference's Model Rules Working Group has completed a set of model procedure and practice regulations
for agency adjudications.



TO OBTAIN COPIES OF THE MODEL REGULATIONS CONTACT: 

Susan Mack, Administrative Conference of the United States, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20037, or (202) 254-7020.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A Working Group of the Office of the Chairman of the Administrative Conference has completed a set of model procedure
and practice regulations, with related commentary, suitable for use in those agency proceedings that offer an opportunity
for an oral, fact-finding hearing before an agency adjudicator, whether conducted pursuant to the Administrative
Procedure Act, other statutes, or agency regulations or practice. Hearings are currently held before presiding
officers at scores of federal departments and agencies. Each agency has its own set of procedure and practice rules
that cover essentially the same procedural areas. To the extent that the conduct of hearings at these agencies presents
similar problems, it appears useful to formulate a set of model procedure and practice rules that addresses common
procedural problems. Such model regulations can be used by those agencies that are either required to establish formal
procedures for new adjudicatory programs or interested in amending their existing rules in selected areas. Because
each agency has its own, unique procedural needs, the model rules are not intended as a set of uniform procedures. Rather,
they are designed to provide a set of recommendations that can be considered by agencies in light of their special procedural
requirements.

Petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of materials, labor, energy, utilities, overhead, general expenses, profit,
and packing. In accordance with the hierarchy preferred for valuing factors (set forth in the notice of Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From the People's Republic of China,
57 FR 21058 (May 18, 1992) (Comment 4)), petitioner relied where possible on publicly available information. Where
such information was unavailable, petitioner relied on its own cost or experience. 

Pursuant to section 773(c)(1) of the Act, petitioner added to the labor and material costs the statutory minima of
10 percent for general expenses and eight percent for profit, as well as an amount for packing based on import statistics
from India. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that the merchandise is being, or is likely
to be, sold at less than fair value. Based on our analysis of information submitted in the petition amendment, we found
it necessary to conduct further research regarding the pricing of certain factors of production upon which FMV was
based. Subsequent to that research, petitioners submitted amendments to the petition including additional price
information. The comparison of USP and FMV in the petition, as amended, indicates margins of 33.59% to 444.37%. If
it becomes necessary at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available (BIA), we may
review all of the bases for USP and FMV in determining BIA. 



Initiation of Investigation 



We have examined the petition on coumarin and have found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act.
Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of coumarin from the
PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. 



ITC Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of this action, and we have
done so. 



Preliminary Determination by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by February 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of coumarin from
the PRC are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Any ITC determination which is negative
will result in this investigation being terminated; otherwise, this investigation will proceed according to statutory
and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

Based upon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaires, we preliminarily determine the following:



I. Program Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Countervailable 


Preferential Pricing of Orthoxylene Feedstock 


Petitioners alleged that the government-owned petrochemical company, Petroquimica de Venezuela, C.A. (``Pequiven''),
is selling orthoxylene (an input product to PA) to Venezuelan producers of PA at preferential prices. 
In its response, the GOV stated that, within Venezuela, Pequiven sells orthoxylene to only two customers, both of
which produce PA. Furthermore, it stated that the prices that Pequiven charges these companies are tied to international
prices for orthoxylene. 
In order to determine whether the GOV, through the state-owned company, Pequiven, provided orthoxylene to PA producers
at preferential prices, we followed the hierarchy for determining benchmark prices as found in  355.44(f)
of the Department's Proposed Regulations (54 FR 23381, May 31, 1989). The Department's preferred benchmark is the
non-specific price that the government charges to the same or other users of the same good within the political jurisdiction.
As noted above, within Venezuela, Pequiven sells orthoxylene only to the two PA producers. Both PA producers are charged
the same price by Pequiven. As a result, we do not have a non-specific price to use as a benchmark. 
In the absence of a non-specific price, the Department normally looks to the alternative benchmarks listed in  355.44(f)(2)
of the Proposed Regulations. The first alternative listed in the Proposed Regulations is the price charged by the
same seller for a similar or related good adjusted for any cost differences. The petition identified paraxylene and
mixed-xylene as two similar products. While Pequiven agrees that these two products, in addition to metaxylene,
are similar products to orthoxylene, it does not produce or sell those products. Pequiven did not identify any other
similar products. Therefore, we were unable to use this approach to calculate a benchmark. 
The second alternative listed in the Proposed Regulations is the price charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers
for an identical good or service. As stated in Carbon Black from Mexico; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty
Administrative Review (51 FR 13269, April 18, 1986), ``[t]hese other sellers may include private sellers within
the jurisdiction or foreign sellers selling into the jurisdiction * * *'' Pequiven is the only domestic
producer/seller of orthoxylene in Venezuela. However, orthoxylene was imported into Venezuela during the POI.

The GOV provided U.S. export statistics on shipments of orthoxylene to Venezuela during the period 1992-1993.
From these statistics, we used the information on the one entry that occurred during the POI to calculate a benchmark
price since this price reflects ``a price charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers for an identical good.''
This import into Venezuela from the United States was reported on a FAS basis. Therefore, we added an amount for ocean
freight and insurance from the United States to Venezuela. The amount for ocean freight and insurance was obtained
from an independent shipping company (see memorandum from case analyst to the file, January 13, 1994). 
We then compared the adjusted import price to the price Pequiven charged for orthoxylene in the month that orthoxylene
was exported from the United States. Based on this comparison, we found that Pequiven's price was greater than the
price of imported orthoxylene. 
For the purposes of this preliminary determination, we find the use of a single import price to be a sufficient basis
for our analysis. We examined prices in the largest international markets for orthoxylene and found minimal price
fluctuations during the POI. In addition, the import price approximated the prices in these markets. 
Furthermore, as stated above, Pequiven ties its domestic prices to international prices. Therefore, we would expect
to find only negligible differences between the price Pequiven charges domestically and the price of imports into
Venezuela. To test this assumption, we averaged U.S. import prices for the three months in which we had data (one within
the POI and two within two months of the POI on either side). We compared this average to the average price Pequiven charged
in the same three months and found that Pequiven's average price was greater than the average price of the imports from
the United States. Therefore, we find that the GOV, through Pequiven, did not provide orthoxylene to PA producers
at preferential rates during the POI. 


II. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Used 


We preliminarily determine that producers or exporters in Venezuela of the subject merchandise did not receive benefits
during the POI for exports of the subject merchandise to the United States under the following programs: 


A. FINEXPO Preferential Short-Term Export Loans 
B. FINEXPO Preferential Long-Term Export Loans 
C. Excessive Tariff Drawback 
D. Preferential Tax Exemptions Under the 1966 Income Tax Law 


Because we find that the GOV did not provide orthoxylene at preferential rates and all other programs were not used,
we preliminarily determine that no benefits which constitute bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing
duty law are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters of PA from Venezuela.

For purposes of these initiations we are considering the subject merchandise to be one class or kind of merchandise.
We invite interested parties to comment on this issue by March 25, 1994. 



United States Price and Foreign Market Value 



Brazil 



Petitioners based United States price (USP) on January-March 1993 invoices issued by the U.S. subsidiary of
Acos Villares SA (Villares), a Brazilian producer of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since USP
was based on C&F terms of sale, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance,
and harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. 

Petitioners used Villares' delivered home market prices as the basis for FMV. These prices and related expenses were
contained in a market research report. FMV was based on actual tax-exclusive, May-June 1993 delivered sales
prices of Villares to unrelated customers in Brazil. Petitioners deducted from FMV an amount for inland freight.


Petitioners indicate that the home market price used for FMV was reported in U.S. dollars, thus taking into account
Brazil's hyperinflationary economy. 

Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margin alleged by petitioners for stainless steel bar from Brazil is
19.43 percent. 



India 



Petitioners calculated USP based on two different methodologies. First, petitioners obtained a July 1993 U.S. price
quote for stainless steel bar from India to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since the prices were quoted C&F for delivery
to the east or west coast of the United States, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for import duties, ocean freight,
marine insurance, and harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. 

Petitioners calculated a second weighted-average USP using the average import values of stainless steel bar from
India for August and September 1993. The unit values were derived from U.S. Department of Commerce import statistics.


Petitioners used Indian home market prices for stainless steel bar from Mukand Ltd., the largest stainless steel
bar producer in India, as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted
from these prices taxes, insurance, freight, and a distributor's margin based on information in the market research
report. Because the comparison of USP and FMV involved non-identical merchandise, petitioners made an adjustment
for differences in merchandise based on information contained in the market research report. 

For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted petitioners' calculation of USP based on the first methodology.
Accordingly, the range of dumping margins of stainless steel bar from India based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged
by petitioners under this methodology is 11.26 to 21.02 percent. 



Italy 



Petitioners based USP on price quotations for U.S. sales made by Cogne, an Italian producer of stainless steel bar,
to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since these USPs were quoted FOB duty paid, petitioners deducted the applicable import
duties. 

Petitioners calculated FMV using two methodologies. First, petitioners used Cogne's delivered home market prices
as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted from these prices
inland freight and insurance based on information contained in the same report. 

Second, petitioners based FMV on constructed value (CV). Petitioners used CV because they alleged that Cogne's home
market sales are being made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Petitioners also allege that another Italian
company, Bolzano, is making home market sales of stainless steel bar at prices below the COP. These allegations are
based on a comparison of home market prices for Cogne and Bolzano, obtained from the market research report, with COP.
COP was based on the COP of an efficient U.S. producer of stainless steel bar, adjusted for known differences in costs
between the United States and Italy. Where petitioners calculated CV, they used the COP derived from this U.S. producer
and added the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit.

The Department is initiating COP investigations for the two companies where petitioners provided company-specific
home market prices, contingent upon whether these companies become respondents in this investigation. The Department
is not initiating COP investigations for those companies and exporters where petitioners did not provide company-specific
home market prices. 

Petitioners allege a price-to-price dumping margin for stainless steel bar from Italy of 15.15 percent. Petitioners
allege a price-to-CV dumping margin of 157.03 percent. 



Japan 



Petitioners based USP on June 1993 sales invoices from Daido Steel Sheet Corporation (Daido), a Japanese producer
of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since the USPs were quoted ex-dock, duty paid, Los Angeles,
petitioners deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S.
merchandise processing fees. 
Petitioners used Daido's delivered May-June 1993 home market sales prices as the basis for FMV. These prices
were contained in a market research report. To calculate an ex-factory price, except for credit, petitioners used
expense information from the market research report. For credit, petitioners used the rate in effect in Japan for
March 1993 as reported in the International Financial Statistics, July 1993. Petitioners deducted from FMV an amount
for inland freight and insurance, trade discounts, rebates and sales promotion expenses, advertising and warranties.
Petitioners made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for credit and packing. 

Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margins alleged by petitioners for stainless steel bar from Japan range
from 48.00 to 61.47 percent. 


Spain 



Petitioners based USP on a September 1993 price quote for U.S. sales made by Acenor, a Spanish producer of stainless
steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. company. Since USP was quoted on a direct mill delivery basis, petitioners deducted
the applicable import duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing
fees. 

Petitioners calculated FMV using two methodologies. First, petitioners used Acenor's delivered home market prices
as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted inland freight
from FMV using information contained in the same report. 

Second, petitioners based FMV on CV because they alleged that Acenor's home market sales are being made at prices below
the COP. Petitioners also allege that another Spanish company, Roldan, is making home market sales of stainless steel
bar at prices below the COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of home market prices for Acenor and Roldan,
obtained from the market research report, with COP. COP was based on the COP of an efficient U.S. producer, adjusted
for known differences in costs between the United States and Spain. Where petitioners calculated CV, they used the
COP from this producer and added the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit. 

The Department is initiating COP investigations for the two companies where petitioners provided company-specific
home market prices, contingent upon whether these companies become respondents in this investigation. The Department
is not initiating COP investigations for those companies and exporters where petitioners did not provide company-specific
home market prices. 

Petitioners allege a price-to-price dumping margin for stainless steel bar from Spain of 38.82 percent. Petitioners
allege a price-to-CV dumping margin of 144.88 percent. 



Initiation of Investigations 



We have examined the petitions on stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain, and have found that
the petitions meet the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations
to determine whether imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain are being, or are likely
to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. 



Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission 



The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by February 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication

Corrections to notice of decision of panel.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On December 14, 1993, the Binational Panel issued its decision in the review of the Final Affirmative Countervailing
Duty Determination on Remand made by the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Import Administration,
respecting Pure Magnesium and Alloy Magnesium from Canada, Secretariat File No. USA-92-1904-03.
A copy of the complete panel decision is available from the Binational Secretariat.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace
domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports
from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel
is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether
it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.




Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and
the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules'').
These Rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panel Reviews, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). The Rules were further amended and a consolidated version of the amended Rules was
published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26698). The panel review in this matter was conducted in accordance with these Rules.



Background




On August 16, 1993, the Binational Panel remanded the final determination to the Department of Commerce for action
not inconsistent with the Panel's decision as follows:

Commerce was asked to reconsider the exercise of its statutory discretion as to whether its disproportionality analysis
should be conducted on an enterprise or industry basis, and provide the Panel a cogent explanation why it exercised
its discretion in a given manner; and

Concerning the appropriate allocation period for grants given to Norsk Hydro for the purchase of pollution control
equipment, Commerce was asked to consider the IRS tables and the producer records, in a manner that satisfies the standard
articulated in the 

IPSCO

 case of ``an allocation period which will accurately reflect the commercial and competitive benefit received by
the plaintiffs in this case,'' and to provide a satisfactory explanation for its reasoning in support of whatever
decision it reaches.

On September 15, 1993, the Department of Commerce issued its Redetermination on Remand.



Panel Decision



On December 14, 1993, the Panel affirmed the redetermination in all respects.

respecting Pure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada, Secretariat File No. USA-92-1904-03.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Memorandum Opinion and Order of the Binational Panel dated December 14, 1993, affirming the determination
on remand, the Panel Review of the final determination described above was completed on January 14, 1994.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 16, 1993, the Binational Panel issued a decision which affirmed in part and remanded in part the final affirmative
countervailing duty determination of the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration
(``ITA'') concerning Pure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada. The panel remanded the ITA's determination in two respects:



(1) For the ITA to explain why, in determining the specificity of the SDI program subsidy, the ITA conducted its ``disproportionality''
analysis on an enterprise-by-enterprise basis rather than on an industry-by-industry basis; and 

(2) For the ITA to explain why its use of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) depreciation tables for the useful life of equipment
in the industry accurately reflects the commercial and competitive benefits received by Norsk Hydro Canada from
grants it received for the purchase of pollution control equipment. 

The panel instructed ITA to provide its redetermination on remand within 30 days (by Sepember 16).

The ITA submitted its redetermination on remand on September 15, 1993, which the Panel Affirmed in all respects. The
Secretariat was instructed to issue a Notice of Completion of Panel Review on the 31st day following the issuance of
the Order, if no Request for an Extraordinary Challenge was filed. No such request was filed. Therefore, on the basis
of the Panel Order and Rule 80 of the Article 1904 Panel Rules, the Panel Review was completed and the panelists discharged
from their duties effective January 14, 1994.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 (Act), as amended
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,
is seeking preliminary information from sources able to demonstrate the commercial potential of emerging renewable
energy (RE) technologies or innovative applications of existing RE technologies, to participate in a competitive
solicitation for DOE financial assistance. In creating the Act Congress stated, ``what is needed is a partnership
between the Federal Government, domestic manufacturers, marketers, and potential users of renewable energy * * *
technologies.'' Without this partnership, the availability of these technologies for domestic industry could
be substantially delayed.''



As defined in the Act, an emerging RE technology is one that has already been proven to work, but which has not been commercialized
or has been limited to sub-commercial demonstration or quantities, to restricted or controlled operation, or to
only selected applications. Awards under the solicitation will be Grants or Cooperative Agreements (depending
on the scope of the project and need for substantial DOE involvement) administered in accordance with 10 CFR 600, DOE's
Financial Assistance Rules.

The following are RE areas that DOE will consider for financial assistance under the solicitation:

 Demonstration of the market readiness of an emerging technology in a new application or environment or at a
sufficient scale or size likely to encourage private investment in commercial facilities or systems.
 Market introduction activities of a product or service having potentially high energy payoff and/or high
replication value by other users.
 Financial support that will reduce risk for, or otherwise enable, private financing of a new venture.
 Financial assistance that will enable private sector investment in new RE manufacturing, evaluation and
test, or quality control facilities leading to commercial product introduction.



Projects may include those for the production or delivery of electricity, thermal energy, or other forms of energy
using renewable energy technology; or, improvements in, or expansion of, facilities for the manufacture of renewable
energy technologies.

It is anticipated that requirements of the solicitation will include that: (1) All teams or applicants in projects
selected shall include at least one for-profit entity; (2) projects selected shall require manufacture and reproduction
substantially within the United States for any invention or product that may result from the project; (3) projects
selected must demonstrate a significant need for federal financial assistance to commercialize or speed commercialization
of the technology.
In general, the solicitation will require cost sharing by applicants of at least 50% of the total project costs in order
to receive an award under the solicitation. All participant cost sharing must come from non-Federal funding sources.
Currently, it is anticipated that total DOE funding in the amount of $10 million will be available for all awards under
the solicitation.
The solicitation will be issued on or about March 1, 1994, and will contain detailed information on funding, cost sharing
requirements, eligibility, application preparation, and evaluation. Responses to the solicitation will be due
45 days after solicitation release. However, applications are encouraged to be submitted prior to the closing date.
All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an application and all applications will be considered.


Project Summary


While not a requirement, DOE strongly encourages all parties interested in applying for financial assistance under
the Commercialization Ventures Program to respond to this notice by providing DOE with a short summary of the prospective
project. The primary use of these summaries by DOE will be to ensure that the overall Program adequately addresses
industry needs. In addition, DOE will review individual summaries in order to advise potential applicants on whether
their proposed project appears to fit within the overall objectives of the Commercialization Venture Program. DOE
will not evaluate individual project summaries on whether they meet any criteria for eventual award. All potential
applicants who submit a project summary will be advised in writing of whether the summary would seem to fit within the
Program or whether the summary seems to present a project that is unsuitable for the Program. If the latter, the potential
applicant will be advised of the reasons the potential project may be unsuitable. Project summaries submitted in
response to this notice should be received no later than 30 calendar days after the appearance of this notification
in order to be considered by DOE in formulating the solicitation.
Failure to respond or furnish the information requested will not disqualify anyone from competing when the competitive
solicitation is issued. However, the distribution list for the solicitation will be generated as a result of responses
to this notice; therefore, all interested parties should respond in some manner, if only by furnishing their name,
address and telephone number.
Project summaries are not expected to include detailed plans. Information contained in the responses will not be
released to the public; however, if proprietary information is included, this should be marked on the applicable
pages. Summaries should be limited to eight (8) pages and include the following information:
1. Name, address, telephone and fax numbers of the primary contact person.
2. The potential participants, proposed roles, key personnel and qualifications.
3. A concise description of the project including discussion of the following: (a.) product concept; (b.) development
status; (c.) where the technology has been demonstrated; (d.) how the technology works; (e.) technical viability,
reliability, and manufacturability, including the identity of a potential manufacturing partner, if known and;
(f.) the estimated cost per kWh or MMBTU the project will produce and the estimated cost once the technology is fully
commercialized.
4. A discussion of the potential market for the product or project.
5. A discussion of the potential benefits of the product or project, such as environmental, energy savings and/or
energy supply contributions.
6. The total estimated cost of the project, the percentage of cost sharing and the potential source(s) of cost sharing.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) hereby announces its interest in receiving applications to support an experimental program in global climate
change, i.e., the measurement and analysis of radiation and cloud/radiation effects. This program is being pursued
in support of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and supports the goals of the DOE Atmospheric Radiation
Measurement (ARM) Program. Funding for this effort comes from both the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental
Research and Development Program (SERDP) and from DOE. In the initial phases of this effort leased Unmanned Aerospace
Vehicles (UAV) will be instrumented and flights will be made in conjunction with ARM site activities. These initial
missions will emphasize measurement of the vertical flux profile in the troposphere and the use of UAV-based measurements
to calibrate satellite derived fluxes. Applications are sought to use the UAV-based data, in conjunction with ARM
site and other data, to address key issues in the radiative heating of the atmosphere; for the use, modification, or
development of UAV-compatible instruments for such radiation and cloud studies; to support instrument development;
and for data analysis which support integration of the UAV-borne instrument data with ARM site and other data. 


These efforts are intended to supply information for the global change scientific community and satisfy DoD SERDP
goals in Global Environmental Change.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of the ARM program is to improve the treatment of radiation and clouds in the models used to predict future
climate, particularly the General Circulation Models (GCM). (The role of clouds in climate change is the highest
science priority in the USGCRP.) The ARM program is one element of a major effort to improve the quality of current models
and to support the development of sets of climate models capable of making regional prediction of climate and climate
change. The major component of the ARM Program is an experimental testbed for the study of the terrestrial radiation
field, properties of clouds, the full life cycle of clouds, and the incorporation of process-level models into climate
models. This testbed is called the Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART). The first ARM CART site began operation in
calendar year 1992 with instruments spread over approximately 60,000 square kilometers centered in Lamont, Oklahoma.
Sites planned for the Tropical Western Pacific Ocean and the North Slope of Alaska are expected to become operational
over the next four years. The present effort supports ARM objectives by providing for instrumentation, collection
and analysis of data on ARM relevant phenomena using UAVs as instrument platforms. The desirability of UAVs for this
research lies in their potential to remain on station or make long range tracks for extended periods (>48 hrs) and/or
to fly at altitudes slightly above the top of the troposphere. These advantages are achieved without concomitant
risk to pilot or crew. 


The altitudes of interest for the present effort extend from about one thousand feet to the top of the troposphere.
The lower altitude is governed by safety and control factors and the upper altitude is expected to be adequate for the
study of most tropospheric and radiation budget investigations. 
Although mission schedules are currently being developed, they are expected to be flexible_three UAV flight missions
are anticipated in the next 18 months. The first three missions will be over the Southern Great Plains ARM Site. These
early missions will emphasize measurement of the vertical radiation flux profile and the use of UAV-borne instruments
to calibrate satellite-derived measurements such as the top-of-the-atmosphere flux. The initial payloads include
up and down-looking, broadband solar and infrared, hemispherical flux radiometers; a nadir viewing spectral radiometer
covering the 0.4 to 4.0 microns; and a meteorology package (temperature, pressure, and water vapor measurements).


{

The goal of the first missions is measurement of the vertical radiation flux profile and they will be conducted with
instruments being integrated into payloads presently; these instruments include broad-band radiometers, a narrow
band radiometer, and a meteorology package (temperature, pressure and water vapor measurement).

}

 Later missions will be more flexible as to goals, mission profiles, and instrument payload. This notice requests
applications to support two categories of effort; analysis of data and development of UAV instruments in pursuit
of the experimental goals.

Data analysis efforts should focus on making maximum use of UAV-derived data, in conjunction with CART and other data
sources, to address key radiative heating issues and to provide calibration/validation of satellite derived data
products. In addition, the investigators funded for these efforts are expected to assist in planning the future missions
to include locations, mission profiles, and instrument complement. Mission planning will be conducted by these
investigators, UAV instrument developers and interested members of the ARM science team, and the UAV mission planning
group. 
Proposed instruments for the UAV missions should provide data relevant and of unique value to the mission's objectives.
Instruments should be compatible with use on a small UAV as part of a multi-instrument payload. Typically they should
weigh less than 30 kg, draw less than 100 W, and occupy less than 1.01m3. Instruments must be capable of autonomous operation
fully exposed to the ambient atmosphere. The UAV payload interface will provide power to the instrument through a
DC Bus (voltage negotiable) and will also provide for telemetering the data stream to the ground. Applications for
instrument development should include optimum conditions for taking data from the proposed instrument as well as
requirements for other instruments on-board or required from other platforms (e.g., the ARM site). The proposed
instruments will be subject to a review at six months after the award. A decision on which instruments to bring to operational
capability will be made at the six month review. 
It is anticipated that approximately $3.5M will be available for awards for these activities contingent on availability
of appropriated funds. Multiple year funding is expected, also contingent upon the availability of funds. The allocation
of funds will depend on the number and quality of applications received. Typical Environmental Sciences Division
awards are $200,000 per year, but range between $50,000 and $750,000. 

The technical portions of the applications should not exceed twenty-five (25) double-spaced pages, and should be
accompanied by an abstract of not more than two paragraphs. 
Information on the development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation, selection
process, and other policies and procedures may be found in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research
Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR part 605. The Application Guide is available from the U.S. Department of Energy,
Office of Health and Environmental Research, Environmental Sciences Division, ER-74 (GTN), Washington,
DC 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (301) 903-4902

National Fuel Gas Supply Corp.; Petition for Waiver of Regulations



January 21, 1994.



Take notice that on December 17, 1993, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) petitioned the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (Commission) for a waiver of certain of the requirements of Order Nos. 497 

et al.








National requests that the Commission waive the requirements of Order Nos. 497 

et al. 

with respect to National's relationship with National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), an affiliated
local distribution company. National claims that since its restructuring plan became effective on August 1, 1993,
Distribution is no longer a sales customer of National. Distribution, which is National's largest single transportation
customer, can make off-system sales without triggering the marketing affiliate rules, so long as the gas sold is not
transported on National's pipeline system. National requests that the Commission allow Distribution to move gas
through National's facilities to a newly created Hug, without triggering the requirements of Order Nos. 497 

et al

.

National further states that copies of this filing were served upon its jurisdictional customers and the Regulatory
Commissions of the states of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, and New Jersey.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214). All such motions to intervene
or protest should be filed on or before February 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available
for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and To Conduct a Scoping
Meeting</DOCTITLE>



January 21, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the
licensee's post-licensing filing that proposes to modify the minimum flows from the project reservoir. The intent
of the proposed flow modification is to help protect fishery resources (primarily the chinook salmon) in the Tuolumne
River. Staff's initial evaluation was issued on December 22, 1993, in a draft environmental assessment (DEA). In
the DEA, staff determined that because some of the proposed alternatives could, under certain circumstances, reduce
the amount of water available to users of the Hetch Hetchy water supply, some of the proposed alternatives may constitute
a major federal action affecting the human environment and recommended preparation of an environmental impact statement.

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision.



Scoping Meeting



A scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, February 10, 1994, at 9 a.m. at the Best Western Mallard's Inn in Modesto,
California. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff
in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS.

The DEA will be considered the initial scoping document. Copies of the DEA are available in the Commission's Reference
and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
Copies of the DEA will also be available at the scoping meeting.



Objectives



At the scoping meeting the staff will: (1) Present environmental issues that are identified for coverage in the EIS;
(2) receive input from meeting participants on the issues presented; (3) clarify the significance of issues; (4)
identify any additional issues that need treatment in the EIS; and (5) identify those issues that do not merit treatment
in the EIS.



Procedures



The scoping meeting will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the
Commission's public record for this proceeding that was noticed on December 29, 1992. Interested persons who are
unable to attend, or do not choose to speak at the scoping meeting, may submit written statements for inclusion in the
public record. All written comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, on or before February 24, 1994.

All written correspondence should clearly show on the first page of each document the following caption: New Don Pedro
Project, FERC Project No. 2299-024.

Further, please note the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring note entities to file an original
and eight copies of any filing with the Commission and parties filing documents, must also serve the documents on each
person whose name is on the official service list.

For further information, please contact John A. Schnagl at (202) 219-2661.

summary information on the major expenditures under the contract, such as direct labor, direct material and supplies,
equipment, travel, and subcontract costs. There are no recordkeeeping requirements. 
This information is used by the EPA to determine the final amount of reimbursable costs to the contractor. The EPA contracting
officer reviews and reconciles this information with EPA's internal records. After the information is verified
through this audit, a final payment is made to the contractor. 


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.66 hours per response, including

Title: 

Land Disposal Restrictions No-Migration Variances. (EPA No. 1353.04; OMB No. 2050-0062). This ICR is a renewal
of an approved collection.



Abstract: 

Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
of 1984, prohibits land disposal of hazardous wastes beyond specified dates unless the owner/operator of a hazardous
waste storage or disposal facility demonstrates to the Administrator of EPA that there will be no migration of hazardous
constituents from the land disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The regulated community can petition
for a variance from statutory prohibitions or treatment requirements promulgated under section 3004, to continue
land disposal of specific hazardous wastes at specific facilities. The requirements for obtaining these variances
and the associated costs are discussed in detail in the ICR.
The Permits and State Programs Division, Office of Solid Waste, will review the petitions and determine if they successfully
demonstrate no migration. Granting of a variance will be based upon successful demonstration that hazardous wastes
can be managed safely in a particular land disposal unit, so that no migration of any hazardous constituents occurs
from the unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The statutory requirement for an application by an interested
person is intended to place the burden on the applicant to prove that a specified waste can be contained safely in a particular
type of disposal unit.


Burden statement: 

The respondent burden for the no-migration petition is estimated to be 9,240 hours for each facility planning to request
a variance.


Respondents: 

Owners/Operators of Hazardous Waste Storage or Disposal Facilities.


Estimated number of respondents: 

2.


Estimated number of responses per respondent: 

1.


Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 

18,492 hours.


Frequency of collection: 

As needed.

I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks

ACTION:

 Notice of program exclusions.





During the month of December 1993, the 
HHS Office of Inspector General imposed 
exclusions in the cases set forth below. 
When an exclusion is imposed, no program 
payment is made to anyone for any items or 
services (other than an emergency item or 
service not provided in a hospital emergency 
room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an 
excluded party under the Medicare, Medicaid, 
Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
Grant and Block Grants to States for Social 
Services programs. In addition, no program 
payment is made to any business or facility, 
e.g., a hospital, that submits bills for 
payment for items or services provided by an 
excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain 
free to decide for themselves whether they 
will continue to use the services of an 
excluded party even though no program 
payments will be made for items and services 
provided by that excluded party. The exclusions 
have national effect and also apply to all other 
Federal non-procurement programs.

<USDEPT>INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Certain Anti-Theft Deactivatable Resonant Tags and Components; Notice of Request for Written Submissions on the
Issues of Remedy, the Public Interest, and Bonding



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. International Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to request submissions on the
issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding in the above-captioned investigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 9, 1993, the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a final initial determination (ID) in this
investigation. Ordinarily, final IDs are processed in accordance with the deadlines set forth in Commission interim
rules  210.53-.56. In this investigation, however, the Commission determined to waive in part the application
of those interim rules and to apply instead a revised procedure, as set forth at 58 FR 63391 (Dec. 1, 1993). Accordingly,
the Commission ordered that consideration of the ALJ's final ID in this investigation would be according to a revised
procedure. Under the revised schedule, the parties were allowed to file petitions for review of the ID, responses
to the petitions for review, and replies to the responses by certain deadlines. The Commission also indicated that
it might later issue a notice requesting written submissions from the parties, other federal agencies, and interested
members of the public on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding, and/or requiring the parties to file
supplemental briefs on violation issues selected by the Commission.



In accordance with the schedule previously announced, complainant filed a petition for review, respondents and
the Commission investigative attorney filed responses to the petition for review, and all parties filed reply submissions.

The Commission has not yet completed its review of the record in this investigation and has made no determinations
with respect to the ID or complainant's petition for review.

If the Commission finds a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) in this investigation,
it could issue (1) an order that could result in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States,
and/or (2) cease and desist orders that could result in respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging
in unfair acts in the importation and sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving
written submissions that address the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered.

If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest.
The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders
would have on (1) the public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production
of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers.
The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public
interest factors in the context of this investigation.

If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the President has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action.
During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under a bond in an amount determined
by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving
written submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed, if any.




WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS:

 The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any other interested persons are requested
to file written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. Comments regarding remedy,
the public interest, and bonding are particularly requested with respect to respondent Custom Securities Industries,
Inc., which was found in default on October 17, 1993. See 58 FR 52323.



Complainant and the Commission investigative attorney are also requested to submit proposed remedial orders for
the Commission's consideration. The written submissions and proposed remedial orders must be filed no later than
the close of business on January 31, 1994. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on February
7, 1994. No further submissions will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.

Persons filing written submissions must file with the Office of the Secretary the original document and 14 true copies
thereof on or before the deadlines stated above. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the
Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such
treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must
include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. See 19 CFR  201.6. Documents
for which confidential treatment is granted by the Commission will be treated accordingly. All nonconfidential
written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary.

This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) and  210.58 of
the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR  210.58).

Copies of the public version of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation
are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202-205-3000.
Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's
TDD terminal on 202-205-1810.

<DOCTITLE>Commission Determination Not to Review an Initial Determination Finding a Violation of Section 337 and Schedule
for the Filing of Written Submissions on Remedy, the Public Interest, and Bonding </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Commission.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative
law judge's (ALJ) final initial determination (ID) in the above-captioned investigation finding a violation of
section 337 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States
after importation of certain tape dispensers.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (``3M'') filed an amended complaint on June 30, 1993, pursuant to section
337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) alleging that three respondents: (1) Acurite Industries Corp.; (2) Fancy
International (HK) Ltd.; and (3) Charles Leonard, Inc. had violated section 337 in the importation into the United
States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain tape dispensers.
The tape dispensers were alleged to infringe the claim of U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180 (the '180 patent). On July
21, 1993, the Commission instituted this investigation by notice published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 39036. 



The Commission terminated respondent Fancy International and amended the notice of investigation to add as respondents
Hoi Fung Industrial Company, Shiang Shin Trading Co., and Safina Office Products by notice published on November
10, 1993, at 58 FR 59735. The Commission terminated respondent Shiang Shin Trading Co. and changed the name of respondent
Safina Office Products to Shiang Shin International, Inc. d/b/a Safina Offfice Products by notice published on January
12, 1994 at 59 FR 1762. 

On November 29, 1993, complainant 3M filed a motion for summary determination of violation of section 337 which was
unopposed. On December 23, 1993, the presiding ALJ issued her final ID finding that there was a violation of section
337. The ALJ found that the '180 patent was valid and infringed. The ALJ also found that a domestic industry exists with
respect to the patent claim in issue. No petitions for review or government agency comments were received by the Commission.
Having examined the record in this investigation, including the ID, the Commission determined not to review the ID,
thereby finding a violation of section 337. 

In connection with final disposition of this investigation, the Commission may issue (1) An order that could result
in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States, and/or (2) cease and desist orders that
could result in respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging in unfair acts in the importation and
sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that address
the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered.

If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest.
The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders
would have on (1) The public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production
of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers.
The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public
interest factors in the context of this investigation. 

If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the President has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action.
During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under a bond, in an amount determined
by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving
submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed, if remedial orders are issued.


 

WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS: 

The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any other interested persons are encouraged
to file written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. 


Complainant and the Commission investigative attorney are also requested to submit proposed remedial orders for
the Commission's consideration. The written submissions and proposed remedial orders must be filed no later than
the close of business on February 9, 1994. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on February
16, 1994. No further submissions will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. 

Persons filing written submissions must file with the Office of the Secretary the original document and 14 true copies
thereof on or before the deadlines stated above. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the
Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such
treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must

for which confidential treatment is granted by the Commission will be treated accordingly. All nonconfidential
written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary. 

This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and section
210.53(h) of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53(h)).

be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary,

the exemption is void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke

Operating Instructions for Implementing the Amendments to the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers Program
in Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of General Administration Letter No. 7-94.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice and publication of General Administration Letter (GAL) No. 7-94 inform the States and cooperating
State agencies of the amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 in Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182). These amendments affect the program of trade adjustment assistance
for workers and the administration of the program by the States pursuant to State agreements with the Secretary of
Labor. The amendments must be implemented as of the respective dates set out in Title V and contained in the GAL published
with this notice


The Title V amendments supersede the statute in effect prior to these amendments and affect the regulations at 20 CFR
part 617 and 29 CFR part 90 currently in effect, to the extent that such prior law and regulations are inconsistent with
the amendments. Pending the issuance of final regulations implementing the provisions of the Title V amendments,
the GAL published with this notice expresses the Department of Labor's position on procedures for implementation
of the amendments and their respective meanings, and constitutes operating instructions to the States.
The Title V amendments also require States to make available certain assistance and services authorized under Title
III of the Job Training Partnership Act to workers whom the Governor preliminarily finds to be adversely affected
by NAFTA. The GAL informs the States of this requirement, and of the potential for secondary workers in firms supplying
component parts to primary producers affected by NAFTA to receive assistance under the Title III program. Additional
information concerning the use of Title III funds to assist these workers and other individuals adversely affected
by NAFTA will be forthcoming.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The GAL relates
primarily to those provisions of Title V of the Act affecting the TAA Program. Most of the provisions of Title V are in
the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974. Some of the provisions of Title V are not in the
form of amendments to the Trade Act, however, they nonetheless must be given effect in implementing the NAFTA-TAA
program.

While the NAFTA-TAA program is generally similar to the existing TAA program, it does differ in several ways:




_Governors have a specific role in the new adjustment assistance program targeted to workers who may be displaced
because of trade with Canada or Mexico. State agencies also have new program responsibilities.

_Group eligibility requirements have been changed to address imports of articles from Mexico and Canada only and
to authorize the certification for NAFTA-TAA of worker groups when the workers' firm shifts production to Mexico
or Canada.

_Workers are required to be enrolled in training to qualify for trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments. Also,
individual workers must be enrolled in training within specified time periods to qualify for TRA after a worker group
is certified for NAFTA-TAA.



_Adjustment assistance to workers adversely affected by NAFTA is also available under Title III of the JTPA. States
are responsible for assuring that certain assistance and services are made available to workers whom the Governor
preliminarily finds to be adversely affected by NAFTA.



_Dislocated workers who are indirectly affected by NAFTA, e.g., workers in firms which supply components to a firm
whose final product is adversely affected by imports from Mexico or Canada, may seek under Title III assistance similar
to that available through the NAFTA-TAA program.




It is the Department's intention to publish for comment proposed regulations regarding implementation of the provisions
of Title V relating to transitional adjustment assistance.

Because the provisions were effective on January 1, 1994, it is essential to inform the States and the cooperating
State agencies of the terms of the provisions and of the Department's instructions concerning the proper implementation
of these provisions.




For the reasons set out above, GAL No. 7-94 is published below.



Signed at Washington, DC, on January 19, 1994.

Directive: General Administration Letter No. 7-94

To: All State Employment Security Agencies

From: Barbara Ann Farmer, Administrator, for Regional Management; 
Wilbert F. Solomon, Deputy Administrator for Regional Management

Subject: Operating Instructions for Implementing the Amendments to the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers
Program in Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act




Rescissions: None

Expiration Date: January 31, 1995




1. 

Purpose

. To assist the States with implementing the Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program in Title V of the NAFTA Implementation
Act. These operating instructions shall remain in effect until superseded or supplemented by further operating
instructions or until amended regulations are published.

To alert the States to the opportunity for the provision of adjustment assistance under Title III of the Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA) to workers in secondary firms who are adversely affected by NAFTA.

2. 

References

. The NAFTA Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182) is referred to as ``the Act.'' The program of trade adjustment
assistance for workers established by Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974 is referred to as the ``TAA Program''.
The Trade Act of 1974 may be referred to as simply the ``Trade Act.'' The NAFTA Implementation Act Title V_NAFTA Transitional
Adjustment Assistance and Other Provisions, affecting the TAA program is referred to as Title V or NAFTA-TAA.

3. 

Background

. The Trade Act of 1974 made major changes to the trade adjustment assistance program for workers displaced because
of increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the workers' firm. On receiving
a petition for trade adjustment assistance from a group of workers or its authorized representative, the Department
of Labor conducts a fact-finding investigation in response to the petition. If the findings substantiate that the
workers of a firm or subdivision of have been adversely affected by import competition, a certification is issued
by the Secretary of Labor to the worker group stating that the workers are eligible to apply at a local office of the State
employment security agency for TAA benefits. Benefits include up to 104 weeks of training in new occupational skills,
and job search assistance and relocation allowances when jobs are not available within the commuting area from the
worker's residence. Workers participating in training (unless the training requirement is waived) may also receive
up to 52 weeks of trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments which are generally equivalent to the worker's unemployment
insurance payment.

Regulations implementing the adjustment assistance program for workers in chapter 2, title II, of the Trade Act are
published at 20 CFR part 617.


On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law the ``North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.''
These implementing instructions relate only to those provisions of Title V affecting the TAA Program. Most of the
provisions of Title V are in the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, and while some of the
provisions of Title V are not in the form of amendments to the Trade Act, they nonetheless must be given effect in implementing
the NAFTA-TAA program.

While the NAFTA-TAA is generally similar to the existing TAA Program, it does differ in several ways. Governors
have a specific role in the new adjustment assistance program targeted to workers who may be displaced because of trade
with Canada or Mexico. State agencies also have new program responsibilities. The NAFTA-TAA program requires
workers to be enrolled in training to qualify for trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments and does not allow the
waiver of the training requirement when training is not ``feasible or appropriate'', which is now available to eligible
workers in the regular TAA program. To provide for these differences, Section 502 of the Act adds a new Subchapter D_NAFTA
Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program, to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act. Subchapter D adds one section_Section
250, Establishment of a Transitional Program_to Chapter 2, Title II of the Trade Act, creating the new NAFTA-TAA
program.

Adjustment assistance to workers adversely affected by NAFTA is also available under Title III of the JTPA. States
are responsible for providing assistance and services to workers whom the Governor preliminarily finds to be adversely
affected by NAFTA. In addition, dislocated workers who are indirectly affected by NAFTA, e.g., workers in firms which
supply components to a firm whose final product is adversely affected, may seek assistance similar to that available
through the NAFTA-TAA program. Effective delivery of these Title III funded services will require governors
to ensure close planning and coordination between the TAA and Title III program operators.

Operating Instructions.

 The operating instructions in this document are issued to the States and the cooperating State agencies as guidance
provided by the Department of Labor in its role as the principal in the TAA Program. As agents of the United States, the
States and cooperating State agencies may not vary from the operating instructions in this document without prior
approval from the Department of Labor (DOL).
Pending the issuance of regulations implementing the provisions of Title V, the operating instructions in this document
shall constitute the controlling guidance for the States and the cooperating State agencies in implementing and
administering the new NAFTA-TAA program, pursuant to the agreements between the States and the Secretary of
Labor under Section 239 of the Trade Act.
Instructions for implementing the JTPA Title III component, including procedures for accessing the national reserve
funds to provide assistance to workers of secondary firms who are adversely affected by NAFTA, will be issued shortly.
NAFTA-TAA amendments are set out in this document according to the section number of the Trade Act affected by
each of the amendments. An explanation of each amendment is furnished with an explanation of the regulations principally
affected, and with additional instructions on the administration of each amendment.


A. Establishment of Transitional Program


Section 502 of the Act establishes a new Subchapter D in Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act as follows:
A.1. 

Group Eligibility Requirements.
AMENDED LAW

. Subsection (a) of section 250 is titled Group Eligibility Requirements. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) sets out
the criteria for certifying a worker group for NAFTA-TAA as follows:
A group of workers (including workers in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) shall be certified
as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under subsection (b) if the Secretary determines that a significant
number or proportion of the workers in such workers' firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally
or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and either_
(A) that_
(i) the sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely,
(ii) imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or
subdivision have increased, and
(iii) the increase in imports under clause (ii) contributed importantly to such workers' separation or threat of
separation and to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or
(B) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like
or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.


ADMINISTRATION

. As mentioned above, paragraph (a)(1) sets out the group eligibility criteria for certifying worker groups for transitional
adjustment assistance. Two sets of criteria are included in subparagraphs (A) and (B). The criteria in subparagraph
(A) are similar to the eligibility criteria in the regular TAA program (section 222 of the Trade Act), except that the
criteria for NAFTA-TAA petitions provide that increased imports must come from Mexico or Canada.
Alternatively, and without reference to whether there have been increased imports from Mexico or Canada under subparagraph
(A), the criterion under subparagraph (B) confers eligibility if the firm or subdivision of the firm has shifted production
to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the firm or subdivision.


Application of Criteria:
For purposes of section 250, the following terms are applied:
Appropriate subdivision

 means an establishment in a multi-establishment firm which produces the domestic articles in question or a distinct
part or section of an establishment (whether or not the firm has more than one establishment) where the articles are
produced. The term ``appropriate subdivision'' includes auxiliary facilities operated in conjunction with (whether
or not physically separate from) production facilities. (OTAA has interpreted the term ``establishment'' to include
a place of business together with its employees, merchandise, equipment, etc.)


Firm

 means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (including a development
corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy, and receiver under decree of any court. A firm,
together with any predecessor or successor-in-interest, or together with any affiliated firm controlled or substantially
beneficially owned by substantially the same persons, may be considered a single firm.


Significant number or proportion of workers

 means that:
a. In most cases the total or partial separations, or both, in a firm or appropriate subdivision thereof, are the equivalent
to a total unemployment of five (5) percent of the workers or 50 workers, whichever is less; or

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. At least three workers in a firm (or appropriate subdivision thereof) with a work force of fewer than 50 workers would
ordinarily have to be affected.



Total or partial separation.

 All analyses of separations must treat total and partial separations equally.

a. 

Partial separation

 means, with respect to an individual who has not been totally separated, that the worker's:

(1) Hours of work have been reduced to 80 percent or less of the worker's average weekly hours at the firm or appropriate
subdivision thereof, and

(2) Wages have been reduced to 80 percent or less of the worker's average weekly wage at the firm or appropriate subdivision
thereof.

b. 

Total separation

 means the layoff or severance of an individual from a firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof.



Criteria in Subparagraph (A):

 The following guidance and definitions shall apply:

a. 

Sales and production

 data must be obtained from the subject firm for the current 12-month period and the previous 12-month period in order
to determine whether an absolute decrease in sales or production has occurred.

b. 

Increased imports.

 The Department's Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance (OTAA) will provide information based on available data
regarding imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the firm or
subdivision of the firm.

c. 

Like or directly competitive

 means that ``like'' articles are those which are substantially identical in inherent or intrinsic characteristics
(i.e., materials from which the articles are made, appearance, quality, texture, etc.); and ``directly competitive''
articles are those which, although not substantially identical in their inherent or intrinsic characteristics,
are substantially equivalent for commercial purposes (i.e., adapted to the same uses and essentially interchangeable
therefor).

An imported article is ``directly competitive'' with a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing,
and a domestic article is ``directly competitive with'' an imported article at an earlier or later stage of processing,
if the importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect
of importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article.



Criterion in Subparagraph (B):

 The criterion under subparagraph (B) breaks down into the following elements:

a. 

Determination of article.

 The article must be like or directly competitive with the article that has been produced in the U.S. by the subject firm
or subdivision of the firm.

Workers of firms that provide a service rather than produce an article are excluded from coverage.

Workers of firms that are suppliers of ``components'' related to the defined ``like or competitive article'' may
be covered only if those articles produced by such firms independently meet the eligibility criteria for certification
or the shift in production criterion.

b. 

Action.

 The article must have been formerly produced by a U.S. located firm or subdivision of the firm and is now produced in
Mexico or Canada. Since the law does not address ownership of the producing firm, the shift in production can be either
by the firm or subdivision moving the plant to Mexico or Canada, or the U.S. firm contracting with a different firm located
in Mexico or Canada.

c. 

Definition.

 A ``shift of production'' is defined to mean a tangible action or commitment to contract or license production of an
article within a definite period of time by the workers' firm with a firm in Mexico or Canada, including the actual production
of an article that was formerly produced by a U.S. located firm or subdivision, by a producing plant located in Mexico
or Canada.

A.2. 

Definition of Contributed Importantly.

AMENDED LAW.

 Subparagraph (a)(2) of section 250 states that the term ``contributed importantly'' means a cause which is important
but not necessarily more important than any other cause.



ADMINISTRATION.

 The term ``contributed importantly'' is the same as used in section 222(b) of the Trade Act for administering the regular
TAA program. The ``contributed importantly'' provision is used by the Department of Labor in its review of petitions
for eligibility for the regular TAA Program and will also be used for the NAFTA-TAA program. Pursuant to section
250(b)(2)(B)(i), Governors, when making a preliminary finding as to whether a petition meets the eligibility requirements
for NAFTA-TAA, discussed above, 

will not

 apply the ``contributed importantly'' test when reviewing NAFTA-TAA petitions.

When the Governor or the designated State official substantiates that the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of sections
250(a)(1)(A) have been met, the petition package including a statement of affirmative preliminary finding is forwarded
to the OTAA for review. To confirm the State's affirmative preliminary finding, the OTAA will apply the criteria in
section 250(a)(1)(A), including the ``contributed importantly'' test in clause (iii).

A.3. 

Regulations.

AMENDED LAW.

 Paragraph (a)(3) of section 250 provides that the Secretary shall issue regulations relating to the application
of the criteria described above in making the preliminary finding and determinations.



ADMINISTRATION.

 Because of the time constraints for implementing the NAFTA-TAA program on January 1, 1994, regulations will
not be in place until after this date. Accordingly, to begin operation of the program, operating instructions will
be issued and published in the 

Federal Register

. States should proceed to implement the NAFTA-TAA program based on these operating instructions.

A.4. 

Filing of petitions.

AMENDED LAW.

 Paragraph (b)(1) of section 250 provides that a petition for certification of eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA
may be filed by a group of workers (including workers in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm)
or by their certified or recognized union or other duly authorized representative with the Governor of the State in
which such workers' firm or subdivision thereof is located.



ADMINISTRATION.

 This section provides that a petition for certification of eligibility may be filed by a group of workers (including
workers in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) or by their certified or recognized union
or other duly authorized representative. It should be noted that a community-based organization may serve as a duly
authorized representative of the workers.



Group

 means three or more workers in a firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof.

A new petition form has been designed for use by worker groups to file petitions for NAFTA-TAA. The NAFTA-TAA
petition form will include a space in the filing instructions on the reverse side to permit the State to add the address
of where the petitions are to be filed. A supply of the NAFTA-TAA petition forms will be furnished to each State.
States should reproduce the NAFTA-TAA petition form to meet its needs.

Copies of the NAFTA-TAA petition form with the address for filing the petition are to be made available by the
States, at a minimum, in every local employment service and unemployment insurance office. Staff in local offices
must be familiar with the NAFTA-TAA program, as well as the regular TAA program, and the procedures being put
in place to assure that workers applying for employment services and unemployment insurance benefits are advised
properly regarding both TAA programs and on filing the proper petition form to the correct location.

NAFTA-TAA petition forms will be submitted to the State official or organization designated by the Governor
to review such petitions.

Worker petitions for the regular TAA program will continue to be submitted directly to the Department of Labor's Office
of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address on the reverse side of the form.

A.5. 

Findings and Assistance.

AMENDED LAW.

 Paragraph (b)(2) of section 250 specifies that upon the receipt of a NAFTA-TAA petition, the Governor will take
the following actions:

A. Notify the Secretary of Labor that the Governor has received the petition.

B. Within 10 days after receiving the petition_

(i) make a preliminary finding as to whether the petition meets the criteria described in subsection (a)(1) (and for
purposes of this clause the criteria described in subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be disregarded), and

(ii) transmit the petition, together with a statement of finding under clause (i) and the reasons therefor, to the
Secretary for action under subsection (c); and

C. If the preliminary finding under subparagraph (B)(i) is affirmative, ensure that rapid response and basic readjustment
services authorized under other Federal law are made available to the workers.



ADMINISTRATION.

 This section establishes a role, as well as precise time frames, for Governors in processing NAFTA-TAA petitions.
Because of these time frames, rigid processing procedures have been designed for coordinating the Governors' activities
with the OTAA.



Time Frames.

Day 1:

a. The Governor receives a petition for NAFTA-TAA.


The State records the receipt date on the face of the petition, reviews the petition for completeness and clarity,
and telephones the company official listed as the contact person on the petition.

b. Telephone contact with the company official is to cover the following:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Determine if the official listed on the petition is the appropriate contact. If not, show the name, telephone number
and FAX number (if available) of the appropriate contact person on the face of the petition.

(2) Confirm the product description reported on the petition. Accuracy is critical to DOL in determining whether
imports of like or directly competitive products have increased.

(3) Ask the company official about total and partial worker separations at the firm during the past 12 months. If there
were separations, ascertain if it was because of increased company imports from Mexico or Canada, an actual or threatened
shift of production to either country, or lost sales to customers to purchase from firms importing from Mexico or Canada.

(4) Alert company official that data request forms will be sent by FAX (if available) or by mail, and obtain the official's
cooperation to supply the requested information within 5 days of petition receipt. If the company official fails
to cooperate, inform the company of subpoena authority to obtain the requested data.

If the company continues to refuse to supply the data, the State must notify the company in writing of its subpoena authority
and determine if the data is to be furnished. Subpoena procedures should be instituted when there is non-compliance
with the request. TAA program regulations at 20 CFR 617.53 provide that States may issue subpoenas for attendance
of witnesses and production of records on the same terms and conditions as under State law. If a State court declines
to enforce a subpoena, the State agency may petition for an order requiring compliance with such subpoena to the United
States District Court within the jurisdiction of which the relevant proceeding under 20 CFR part 617 is conducted.

Obviously, encouraging company cooperation is the best solution to obtaining requested information. Use of subpoena
procedures often result in lengthy legal negotiations and even court proceedings. Notify OTAA when subpoena procedures
are being considered.

(5) Use the dedicated line (telephone number 202-501-6489) to FAX to OTAA the face page of the petition
form as well as any corrections or additions obtained during telephone contacts with the company official. This action
will serve as notification to the Secretary that the Governor has received a petition and that the investigation has
been initiated.

(6) FAX (if available) or mail the data request forms, which include a request for a listing of company customers, to
the company official, specifying a due date for the information to be returned via FAX or mail. If appropriate, inform
the State employment security agency that an investigation is underway.

(7) OTAA will check its records for duplicate petitions and assign a NAFTA-TAA number to the case. OTAA will enter
the case number in the OTAA Management Information System and institute the investigation of the petition. A notice
of the investigation will be forwarded for publication in the 

Federal Register

 and the regional offices and State agencies notified according to established procedures in the regular TAA Program.

(8) OTAA will begin the analysis of aggregate U.S. imports for the article(s) listed in the petition that are like or
directly competitive with the article(s) produced at the subject firm.



Day 3

OTAA will complete the aggregate import analysis and FAX a determination to the State as to whether relevant imports
from Mexico or Canada have increased. This determination will be made part of the case file as it will be used by the State
in making its preliminary finding.

Day 5

If the data package has not been received from the company official, the State will contact the company official to
urge completion and transmittal by mail or FAX (if available) of the data.

Day 10

a. State will make a preliminary finding regarding whether the petition meets the criteria in section 250(a)(1),
except clause (A)(iii), and will prepare a brief statement on the basis for the finding.

b. State will FAX the petition face sheet, the data packet (including the customer list), and the preliminary finding
and reasons for the finding, to OTAA.

c. State will notify the petitioners of the Governor's preliminary finding on the NAFTA-TAA petition and that
the petition package is being submitted to the Secretary of Labor for review and final determination.

d. When an affirmative determination is made, the State will take the necessary action to ensure that the JTPA Title
III (Economic Dislocated Worker Adjustment Assistance) rapid response and basic readjustment services are made
available to the impacted workers.

A.6. Review of Petition by Secretary: Certifications.

AMENDED LAW

. Subparagraph (c)(1) of section 250 provides that the Secretary of Labor, within 30 days after receiving from the
Governor a petition for NAFTA-TAA, shall determine whether the petition meets the group eligibility requirement
for certification. Upon a determination that the petition meets such criteria, the Secretary shall issue to workers
covered by the petition a certification of eligibility to apply for assistance under NAFTA-TAA.


ADMINISTRATION

. The OTAA will review the State's preliminary finding on all NAFTA-TAA petitions. If an affirmative preliminary
finding from the State, based on a shift in production to, or imports from, Mexico or Canada, is confirmed through an
independent review by the OTAA, the Secretary will issue a certification of eligibility to apply for assistance.
This determination will be published in the 

Federal Register

.
If the affirmative preliminary finding from the State is not based on a shift in production to Mexico or Canada by the
subject firm or on company imports from Mexico or Canada, OTAA will initiate a customer survey to determine whether
the increase in aggregate imports contributed importantly to the workers' separations and to the decline in sales
or production at the subject firm.
The OTAA will complete the customer survey, and the Secretary will issue a final determination within 30 days of the
receipt of the State's preliminary finding.
The Secretary's determination to grant or deny certification will be sent by FAX to the State and appropriate regional
office. This determination will also be published in the 

Federal Register

.
A.7. 

Denial of Certification

.


AMENDED LAW

. Paragraph (c)(2) of section 250 provides that upon denial of certification with respect to a petition under paragraph
(1), the Secretary shall review the petition in accordance with the requirements of the regular TAA program under
subchapter A of chapter 2 of title II the Trade Act to determine if the workers may be certified under such subchapter.


ADMINISTRATION

. When a determination is made by the Secretary of Labor that the petition does not meet the eligibility requirements
for NAFTA-TAA, the petition will immediately be reviewed by the OTAA under subchapter A of the Trade Act.
The 60-day time period under section 223 of Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act for completing the review of a petition
under subchapter A will begin on the date the denial of the NAFTA-TAA petition is issued.
A.8. 

Comprehensive Assistance

.


AMENDED LAW

. Subsection (d) of section 250 provides that workers covered by a certification for NAFTA-TAA shall be provided,
in the same manner and to the same extent as workers covered under a certification for regular TAA, the following:
1. Employment services described in section 235 of the Trade Act.
2. Training described in section 236 of the Trade Act, except that notwithstanding the provisions of section 236(a)(2)(A),
the total amount of payments for any fiscal year shall not exceed $30 million.
3. Trade readjustment allowances (TRA) described in sections 211 through 234 of the Trade Act, except that_
A. The provisions of sections 231(a)(5)(C) and 231(c) of the Trade Act, authorizing the payment of TRA upon a finding
that it is not feasible or appropriate to approve a training program for a worker, shall not be applicable to payment
of such allowance under subchapter D; and
B. Notwithstanding the provision of section 233(b) of the Trade Act, in order for a worker to qualify for TRA under the
NAFTA-TAA program, the worker shall be enrolled in a training program approved by the Secretary under section
236(a) by the later of_
(i) the last day of the 16th week of such worker's initial unemployment compensation period, or
(ii) the last day of the 6th week after the week in which the Secretary of Labor issues a certification covering such
worker.
In cases of extenuating circumstances related to enrollment in a training program, the Secretary may extend the time
for enrollment for a period not to exceed 30 days.
4. Job search allowances described in section 237.
5. Relocation allowances described in section 238.

ADMINISTRATION.

 The administration of the benefit provisions of the NAFTA-TAA program is similar to the regular TAA program
except that the NAFTA-TAA program requires workers to be enrolled in training to qualify for TRA payments. The
NAFTA-TAA program prohibits the waiver of the training requirement when training is not ``feasible or appropriate,''
which is available to eligible workers in the regular TAA program. Also, the NAFTA-TAA program requires workers
to be enrolled in training by prescribed time periods to qualify for TRA.

a. 

Employment Services.

 Employment services described in section 235 of the Trade Act are to be provided to NAFTA-TAA certified workers
as provided to workers certified for regular TAA. Employment services are to be provided to NAFTA-TAA certified
workers to the same extent that such services are provided to any workers seeking employment services under other
Federal laws; i.e., Wagner-Peyser Act and Title III of JTPA. (See 20 CFR 617.20 and 617.21)

b. 

Training.

 Training is to be provided to NAFTA-TAA certified workers according to section 236 of the Trade Act.

Workers certified under NAFTA-TAA will have to satisfy the same criteria in 20 CFR 617.22(a) as apply to workers
certified under the regular TAA program.

The Act provides that payments for NAFTA-TAA training for any fiscal year shall not exceed $30 million. With
regard to this funding limitation, the Department will track nationally the amount of program funds allocated to
the States and the amount of funds committed by the States in order to satisfy this statutory provision. States will
be informed when the amount approaches $30 million nationally. Should the demand for funds exceed the limitation,
instructions will be furnished on how to handle demands for training that exceed the statutory limitation.

c. 

Trade Readjustment Allowances.

 To qualify for TRA payments, an eligible worker must be enrolled in a training program approved by the later of_

(i) the last day of the 16th week of such worker's initial unemployment compensation period, or

(ii) the last day of the 6th week after the week in which the Secretary of Labor issues a certification covering such
worker.



Application of time periods. 

The 16-week time requirement for enrolling in training in order to qualify for TRA will be applied literally. In order
to be eligible to receive TRA under a NAFTA-TAA certification, the worker must be enrolled in an approved training
program by the end of the 16th week of that worker's initial unemployment compensation benefit period.

This fixed 16-week period begins with the effective date of the claim and ends with the last day of the 16th week thereafter.
Included in this 16-week fixed period are weeks of waiting period credit, weeks of disqualification, weeks of employment,
and weeks of unemployment.




Initial unemployment compensation benefit period

 means the same as the term ``first benefit period'' defined at 20 CFR 617.3(r). ``First benefit period'' means the
benefit period established after the individual's first qualifying separation or in which such separation occurs.



Enrolled in Training.

 For purposes of this provision, a worker shall be considered to be enrolled in training when the worker's application
for training is approved by the State agency and the training institution has furnished written notice to the State
agency that the worker has been accepted in the approved training program beginning within 30 calendar days.



Extenuating Circumstances.

 The Act provides that the Secretary, for justifiable cause, may extend the time for enrollment for a period not to exceed
30 days. It is anticipated that there will be situations beyond the worker's control where the worker is unable to enroll
in training by the later of the last day of the 16th week of the worker's initial benefit period or the 6th week after the
week that a certification was issued. Such situations could involve training programs that are abruptly canceled
or circumstances where the first available enrollment date is past the deadline, as well as injury or illness which
may adversely affect the ability of workers to enroll in training. The authority to grant 30-day extensions to workers
is delegated to States or State agencies as one of their responsibilities under section 239 of the Trade Act.

The application of this 30-day grace period will be used only in rare circumstances. Workers who fail to enroll in training
by the end of this 30-day period are still eligible to participate in approved training and have the training costs
paid with NAFTA-TAA program funds but will not qualify for TRA. This provision places added responsibilities
on both the worker and the State agency to satisfy the time limits for enrolling in training in order to qualify for TRA.
Workers certified for NAFTA-TAA must be informed promptly of the time provisions by the State agency when a NAFTA-TAA
certification is issued.

In order to satisfy these provisions, information bulletins or brochures furnished to claimants by the State unemployment
insurance agency and to applicants for employment services should include information on the time provisions for
NAFTA-TAA certified workers to qualify for TRA. Other means of informing workers of the time limits are through
newspaper notices and letters sent to individual workers when a certification is issued, as required in section 225
of the Trade Act and regulations at 20 CFR 617.4.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Although the use of brochures, newspaper notices and individual letters are important resources for informing workers
of the time provision for enrolling in training, they do not relieve States of their responsibility for helping workers
enroll in a training program in a timely manner.

State agencies shall follow existing funding a precertification procedures for NAFTA-TAA program petitions
now used for regular TAA Program petitions. Initiation of fact-finding investigations in response to NAFTA-TAA
petitions will be announced through publication of the information in the 

Federal Register

, in the same manner as regular TAA petitions.

Under precertification responsibilities, State agencies must obtain information from the subject firm about layoffs
beginning on and after December 8, 1993, including the names and social security numbers of the affected workers.
The State agency staff shall also follow the procedures used for the regular TAA Program to check UI files, flag appropriate
claims, and maintain coordination between the UI and ES offices to ensure that workers are enrolled in approved training
within the statutory time frames so they are not denied TRA eligibility.

d. 

Prohibition of Training Waivers.

 Provisions of sections 231(a)(5)(C) and 231(c) of the Trade Act, authorizing the payment of TRA upon a finding that
it is ``not feasible or appropriate'' to approve a training program for a worker, 

are not applicable

 to payment of TRA under the NAFTA-TAA program.

Thus, in order for a worker to qualify for TRA under the NAFTA-TAA program, the worker must be enrolled in training
approved under section 236(a) of the Trade Act.

e. 

Job search allowances.

 Workers certified for NAFTA-TAA are eligible for job search allowances to the same extent and under the same
conditions as workers certified for the regular TAA program under section 237 of the Trade Act.

f. 

Relocation allowances.

 Workers certified for NAFTA-TAA are eligible for relocation allowances to the same extent and under the same
conditions as workers certified for the regular TAA program under section 238 of the Trade Act.

A.9. 

Administration of NAFTA-TAA.





AMENDED LAW.

 Subsection (e) of section 250 states that the provisions of subchapter C of Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act shall
apply to the administration of the NAFTA-TAA program in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions
apply to the administration of the regular TAA program under subchapters A and B of the Trade Act, except that the agreement
between the Secretary and the States described in section 239 of the Trade Act shall specify the procedures that will
be used to carry out the certification process under subsection (c) of section 250 and the procedures for providing
relevant data by the Secretary to assist the States in making preliminary findings under subsection (b) of section
250.



ADMINISTRATION.

 The procedures for NAFTA-TAA certification process under subchapter D of Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act
are:

a. The certification procedures set forth in Sections A.5 and A.6 of this document provide operating instructions
on the methods for making preliminary determinations under section 250(b) of the Trade Act and the Secretary's review
of petitions under subsection (c).

b. Upon request from the Governor, the Secretary will make a determination of what relevant import data is needed to
satisfy the criteria for making a preliminary finding under subsection (b) and provide such data to the State.

c. Pursuant to section 250(c), the Secretary will conduct a full investigation to determine if the petition for NAFTA-TAA
certification meets the criteria specified in subsection (a).



B. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS



Section 503 of the new law provides conforming amendments to the Trade Act as follows:

B.1. 

References.

AMENDED LAW.

 Subsection (a) of section 503 of the new law amends sections 221(a), 222(a), and 223(a) by striking out ``assistance
under this chapter'' and inserting ``assistance under this subchapter''.



ADMINISTRATION.

 These are technical changes which do not have a material effect on the administration and operation of the TAA and NAFTA-TAA
programs.
B.2. 

Benefit Information.

AMENDED LAW.

 Subsection (b) of section 225 is amended by inserting ``or subchapter D'' after ``subchapter A'' each place it appears.

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Administration.

 This change is needed because of the addition of subchapter D in Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act. The impact of this
amendment is to require that the same types of benefit information be furnished by State agencies to workers applying
for unemployment insurance and to workers certified for NAFTA-TAA as are required by the regular TAA program.

B.3. 

Nonduplication of Assistance.

AMENDED LAW.

 Subsection (c) of section 503 amends subchapter C of Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act by adding a new section 249A
at the end on nonduplication of assistance. This new section provides that no worker may receive assistance relating
to a separation pursuant to certifications under both subchapters A and D.



ADMINISTRATION.

 This new section is intended to eliminate duplication of assistance and benefits to a worker in situations where a
worker group is certified concurrently for both regular TAA and NAFTA-TAA. These situations should be uncommon.
However, should this occur, the worker will be provided benefits under one or the other certification. The worker
is to make the decision regarding which certification will apply. Once a decision is made by the worker, it cannot be
changed. Also, State agency staff must explain the differences between programs so workers can make an informed choice.

B.4. 

Judicial Review.

AMENDED LAW.

 Subsection (d) of section 503 amends section 284 of the Trade Act by inserting ``or section 250(c) after ``section
223.''



ADMINISTRATION.

 Section 284 (19 U.S.C. 2395(a)) of the Trade Act addresses judicial review.

Subsection (d) has the effect of providing workers aggrieved by a decision of the Secretary of Labor on a petition,
the same rights for judicial review as provided to workers pursuant to section 284 of the Trade Act. Regulations addressing
judicial review are also set out at 29 CFR 90.19.



C. TERMINATION OF TRANSITION PROGRAM



C.1. Termination of Transition Program.



AMENDED LAW.

 Section 505 of the Act amends subsection (c) of section 285 of the Trade Act by_

(1) striking ``No'' and inserting ``(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), no''; and

(2) adding at the end the following new paragraph:

(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no assistance, voucher, allowance, or other payments may be provided
under subchapter D of chapter 2 after the day that is the earlier of_

(i) September 30, 1998, or

(ii) the date on which legislation, establishing a program providing dislocated workers with comprehensive assistance
substantially similar to the assistance provided by such subchapter D, becomes effective.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if, on or before the day described in subparagraph (A), a worker_

(i) is certified as eligible to apply for assistance, under subchapter D of chapter 2; and

(ii) is otherwise eligible to receive assistance in accordance with section 250.




such worker shall continue to be eligible to receive such assistance for any week for which the worker meets the eligibility
requirements of such section.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



ADMINISTRATION

. Although the amended section is not part of Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act, it does have a significant impact
on the payment of benefits to NAFTA-TAA certified workers after the September 30, 1998 expiration date of the
TAA program or an earlier expiration date prescribed in any new law. While it is important to be aware of this provision,
the Department of Labor will provide precise closeout information to States in advance of the statutory expiration
date, or if the expiration date is impacted by a law change.



D. EFFECTIVE DATES



D.1. 

General.

AMENDED LAW

. Subsection (a) of section 506 of the Act provides that sections 501, 502, 503, 504, and 505 shall take effect on the
date the Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.



ADMINISTRATION

. It is expected that NAFTA will enter into force on January 1, 1994.

D.2. 

Covered Workers; In General

.



AMENDED LAW

. Subsection (b)(1), of section 506 of the Act states that, except as provided in paragraph (2) of section 506, no worker
shall be certified as eligible to receive assistance under subchapter D of chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act (as
added by this subtitle) whose last total or partial separation from a firm (or appropriate subdivision of a firm) occurred
before such date of entry into force.



ADMINISTRATION

. With the exception of the reachback provision, which is discussed in the next section, no worker is to be certified
as eligible to receive assistance under NAFTA-TAA whose last separation under a certification occurred before
the NAFTA date of entry into force.

D.3. 

Covered Workers; Reachback.

AMENDED LAW

. Subsection (b)(2), of section 506 of the new law provides that notwithstanding paragraph (1), any worker_

(A) whose last total or partial separation from a firm (or appropriate subdivision of a firm) occurs_

(i) after the date of the enactment of this Act, and

(ii) before such date of entry into force, and

(B) who would otherwise be eligible to receive assistance under subchapter D of chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act
of 1974, shall be eligible to receive such assistance in the same manner as if such separation occurred on or after such
date of entry into force.



ADMINISTRATION

. In determining the eligibility of workers for benefits under NAFTA-TAA, consideration must be given to the
date a worker is separated from employment. A worker whose last total or partial separation from a firm occurred after
the enactment of Pub. L. 103-182 on December 8, 1993, but before the date of entry into force of NAFTA (which is
anticipated to be on January 1, 1994), may be eligible for certification under the ``reachback'' provision in section
506(b)(2) of the Act.

Workers whose total or partial separation occurred at an earlier time must petition under the regular TAA program
to be eligible for TAA services and benefits. The regular TAA program allows workers laid off up to one year prior to
the date of the petition on which a certification of eligibility is issued to qualify for services and benefits.

It is important for State agency staff members to be familiar with the reachback provisions of both the NAFTA-TAA
and regular TAA programs so that they can properly advise workers regarding which program may be applicable to their
situation.

5. 

Action Required

. States are required to implement the provisions of the NAFTA Amendments as set forth in this document as of the date
of NAFTA entry into force which is expected to be on January 1, 1994. States are advised to inform all appropriate staff
of the contents of this document.

6. 

Inquiries

. States are to direct all inquiries to the appropriate ETA Regional Office.

7. 

Attachment

. Title V_NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance and Other Provisions.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Tennessee Valley Authority; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33 and DPR-68 issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority
(the license) for operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3, located in Limestone County, Alabama.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action is in response to the licensee's application dated September 2, 1993, with additional information
provided on December 17, 1993, for exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical
protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.'' Under the proposed
exemption, the licensee would be relieved of requirements to provide positive containment access control by a guard
or watchman during periods of frequent access. BFN Units 1 and 3 have been shut down since March 1985 for modifications
required to put the units in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The proposed exemption would be
in effect until immediately before the licensee loads fuel in the reactors when the required modifications are completed.



The Need for the Proposed Action



Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an outside physical protection
system and security organization. Containment access controls specified by 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) require that any
time frequent access to the containment is required, positive controls are maintained by a guard or watchman to assure
only authorized personnel or materials are permitted into the containment.

BFN Units 1 and 3 have been defueled since September 1985 and February 1987, respectively. These reactors have been
shut down since March 1985 for modifications required to put the units in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
A substantial number of the required modifications require frequent containment access. Therefore, the licensee
has maintained a guard at a controlled access location to fulfill the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8).

The licensee believes that the 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) requirements are too restrictive, given the unique status of Browns
Ferry Units 1 and 3 and the other controls which are or will be exercised to ensure the reactors are returned to service
in a safe manner. Presently, the reactors are defueled, which reduces the radiological hazard potential within the
containment such that sabotage could not create a substantial offsite radiation dose. The licensee will perform
extensive return-to-service testing on all safety-related systems. This testing ensures that plant components
can properly perform their intended design functions. After modifications are completed, the licensee will also
perform security inspections to detect sabotage or introduction of foreign material which may have occurred during
the recovery effort.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) is required to permit the licensee to relax containment access controls during
the recovery of Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3. The proposed exemption will not reduce requirements for containment access
controls for Browns Ferry Unit 2. 





Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action





The licensee has indicated that during the period of the exemption, the reactors will be maintained in a defueled condition.
Postulated radiological sabotage within the containment in this condition cannot result in significant offsite
radiation doses. Therefore, the environmental impact of this sabotage is negligible. There is no other change in
environmental impact while the reactors are defueled. 



The licensee has also indicated that, as the reactors are refueled and returned to service, it will perform extensive
testing and inspections which will detect latent sabotage which could adversely impact plant operations. The licensee
will test safety-related systems as they are returned to service to assure they are capable of fulfilling their design
functions. The licensee will also perform security inspections to determine if unauthorized and potentially dangerous
materials such as explosives have been introduced. These measures provide confidence that the reactors will operate
as intended by their design. Therefore, the environmental impact of plant operations after the period of the exemption
is unchanged from normally anticipated conditions. 



Accordingly, the Commission concludes that granting the proposed exemption would result in no significant radiological
environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts the proposed exemption does not affect
non-radiolgical plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that
there are no significant non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed exemption. 





Alternative to the Proposed Action 





Because the staff has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternative to the exemption will have either no significantly different environmental impact, or greater environmental
impact. 



The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. Denial of the exemption would result in no change
in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed exemption and this alternative are
similar. 





Alternative Use of Resources





This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement,
Browns, Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1, 2, and 3,'' dated September 1, 1972.





Agencies and Persons Contacted





The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request dated September 2, 1993, as supplemented on December 17, 1993. The
NRC staff did not consult with other agencies or persons. 





Finding of No Significant Impact





The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect
on the quality of the human environment. 
For details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for the exemption dated September 2, 1993, as supplemented
on December 17, 1993, 


 which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington DC, and at the Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama 35611.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Co., et al., Clinton Power Station, Unit 1; Proposed Corporate Restructuring</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering approval
under 10 CFR 50.80 of the proposed corporate restructuring of Illinois Power Company (IP), the owner and licensee
for the Clinton Power Station, Unit 1. By letter dated November 11, 1993, Sidley & Austin, acting as counsel to
IP, informed the Commission that the Board of Directors has proposed a corporate restructuring plan to be presented
at the February 9, 1994, annual shareholders meeting. If a majority of IP shareholders approve the plan, IP will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new holding company, IP Holding Company, effective on or about April 1, 1994. IP would
remain as holder of the license for the Clinton Power Station. If the plan is approved, the common stock of IP will be
converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock of the holding company. According to the proposed plan, the
current IP Board of Directors will serve in the same capacity for the holding company, and there will be no significant
change in ownership, management, or sources of funds for operation of the Clinton Power Station.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80, the Commission may approve the transfer of control of a license, after notice to interested
persons. Such action is contingent upon the Commission's determination that the holder of the license following
the transfer is qualified to have the control of the license and that the transfer of such control is otherwise consistent
with applicable provisions of law, regulations and orders of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval
of Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Stock Upside Note Securities
(``SUNS'')</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



I. Introduction



On November 18, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and
trade Stock Upside Note Securities (``SUNS''),
 the return on which is based on the Lehman Brothers Global Emerging Telecommunications Basket (``Telecommunications
Basket'').
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1993.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On January 6, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the
proposed rule change.
 This order approves the proposal.










II. Description of the Proposal



Under section 107 of the Exchange's Company Guide (``Guide''), the Amex may approve for listing securities which
can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, and
warrants. The Amex is proposing to list for trading under section 107 of the Guide, Telecommunications Basket SUNS.

The Telecommunications Basket SUNS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107 of the Guide, which provide
that issues must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (2) a minimum of 400 shareholders;
and (3) a market value of at least $20 million. In addition, the listing guidelines provide that the issuer have assets
in excess of $100 million, and stockholder's equity of at least $10 million. In the case of an issuer which is unable
to satisfy the earnings criteria stated in section 101 of the Guide, the Exchange will require the issuer to have the
following: (1) Assets in excess of $200 million and stockholders' equity of at least $10 million; or (2) assets in excess
of $100 million and stockholders' equity of at least $20 million.

SUNS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Lehman Brothers. SUNS will have a term of four to seven years
and will pay an annual coupon based on the annual appreciation of the Telecommunications Basket. At maturity, holders
of SUNS also will receive from the issuer the entire principal amount of the note. Telecommunications Basket SUNS
are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership
right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate portfolio
value of the Telecommunications Basket.

According to the Amex, Telecommunications Basket SUNS will allow investors to combine the protection of the principal
amount of the SUNS with potential additional payments based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing
24 highly capitalized global telecommunications companies. In particular, the proposed Telecommunications Basket
SUNS will provide 100% principal protection of the original issue price at maturity with the opportunity to participate
in any upside appreciation of the underlying Telecommunications Basket during the term of the note. 

The Telecommunications Basket consists of securities of 24 global telecommunications companies that have significantly
different levels of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately US$77.5 billion for American Telephone
& Telegraph Company to a low of approximately US$616 million for Champion Technology.
 The securities in the Telecommunications Basket include the common stock of five U.S. telecommunications companies,9
the common stock of three foreign issuers (which stocks are listed and trade on, or traded over the facilities of, U.S.
securities markets),10 ADRs of nine foreign issuers,11 and the ordinary shares of seven foreign issuers traded primarily
on or through non-U.S. securities markets.12 The average daily trading volume for the components of the Telecommunications
Basket for the period from August 1993, through October 1993, ranged from a high of approximately 2.4 billion shares
for Telecommunications Brasileiras S.A., to a low of approximately 45,000 shares for Tadiran. In addition, the public
float13 as of November 2, 1993 for the securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket ranged from a high of approximately
US$74.8 billion for American Telephone & Telegraph Company to a low of approximately US$275 million for Tadiran.

<TEXT>
 

At the outset, each of the securities in the Telecommunications Basket will have equal representation. Specifically,
each security included in the portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents
an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number
of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price, to be included in the calculation of the portfolio.
Accordingly, each of the 24 companies included in the Telecommunications Basket will represent approximately 4.167%
of the total portfolio at the time of issuance.

The multiplier for each security in the Telecommunications Basket will generally remain unchanged except for limited
adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends.
 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security.
In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require
a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect.







If the issuer of a security included in the Telecommunications Basket no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger,
acquisition or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Lehman Brothers will assign to that security
a value equal to the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company
included in the Telecommunications Basket is acquired by another company, Lehman Brothers shall thereafter assign
a value to the share of the acquired company's securities equal to the value per share at which time the acquisition
takes place. If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding,
insolvency, or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Telecommunications
Basket so long as a market price for such security is available. If a market price is no longer available for a portfolio
security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding,
then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection with calculating the daily portfolio
value and the closing portfolio value of the Telecommunications Basket, for so long as no market price exists for that
security.

The value of the Telecommunications Basket will initially be calculated once a day either by an affiliate of Lehman
Brothers or by an independent calculation agent (``Pricing Agent''). These values will be disseminated to investors
once a day after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. The portfolio value, for any day, will equal the sum of the products
of the most recently available market prices and the applicable multipliers for the portfolio securities.
 In addition, if the Pricing Agent is an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers has undertaken to implement
certain surveillance and compliance procedures with respect to the dissemination of the portfolio value, requiring
that the portfolio value be announced only through public dissemination and restricting the access of the affiliate's
trading desk to the portfolio value determined by the affiliate.







Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be denominated in U.S. dollars and will entitle holders to receive annual coupon
payments based upon the percentage change in the value of the Telecommunications Basket from the beginning to the
end of the year. If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the holder will receive not less than 100% of the original
principal amount of the security. Like the MITTS listed on the NYSE, Telecommunications Basket SUNS may not be redeemed
prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be able to cash-out
of their investment by selling the security on the Amex. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security
in this secondary trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Telecommunications
Basket and also on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Telecommunications
Basket, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Lehman Brothers.

Because Telecommunications Basket SUNS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the Amex's existing equity
floor trading rules will apply to the trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS. First, pursuant to Amex Rule 411,
the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating
to every customer prior to trading Telecommunications Basket SUNS.
 Second, consistent with Amex Rule 411, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading Telecommunications Basket SUNS prior to, or promptly after, the completion
of the transaction. Third, Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange.
Fourth, prior to trading Telecommunications Basket SUNS, the Exchange will distribute a circular to the membership,
in the form reviewed by the Commission, providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in Telecommunications Basket SUNS and highlighting
the special risks and characteristics of the Telecommunications Basket SUNS.




III. Commission Findings and Conclusions


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS
will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for global telecommunications securities. In
particular, the Commission believes that Telecommunications Basket SUNS will permit investors to gain equity exposure
in global telecommunications companies, while at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment.22
For these reasons, as well as those discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders,23 the Commission finds that the listing
and trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS by the Amex is consistent with the Act.






As with MITTS, Telecommunications Basket SUNS are not leveraged instruments, however, their price will still be
derived and based upon the underlying basket of securities. Accordingly, the level of risk involved in the purchase
or sale of a Telecommunications Basket SUNS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common
stock. Nonetheless, as with the MITTS, the Commission has several specific concerns regarding the trading of this
type of product.
The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the
trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to Telecommunications Basket SUNS. In particular, by imposing the
hybrid listing standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission believes
the Exchange has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of Telecommunications
Basket SUNS. Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to the specific
risks associated with Telecommunications Basket SUNS.

The Commission notes that Lehman Brothers intends to have the Pricing Agent publish the value of the Telecommunications
Basket once each business day after 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time for dissemination to electronic reporting services
as well as to newspapers and trade publications. Lehman Brothers asserts that the value of a SUNS does not necessarily
correlate with the intra-day price moves related to the underlying component securities, largely as a result of the
time value to maturity of the SUNS.

As a general matter, the Commission continues to believe that for new derivative products, real-time dissemination
of the value of the underlying instrument should be provided to all investors. Nevertheless, the Commission has determined
to permit Telecommunications Basket SUNS to trade without real-time dissemination at this time for several reasons.
First, a SUNS is not a leveraged product that has its value determined primarily from the underlying securities but
rather guarantees recoupment of 100% of the principal amount. Second, factors such as the creditworthiness of the
issuer, in addition to price movements in the underlying securities will be relevant in pricing the Telecommunications
Basket SUNS. Third, the Telecommunications Basket SUNS should, at least prior to expiration, trade more like a bond
or debt security, based on the issuer's ability to perform rather than the value of the Telecommunications Basket.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that real-time dissemination of the aggregate market value of the underlying
Telecommunications Basket is not necessary at this time but would nevertheless expect Lehman Brothers, along with
the Amex, to monitor the product to determine if increased reporting is necessary especially as the product approached
maturity.







The Commission realizes that SUNS do not contain a clearinghouse guarantee (as in the case of standardized options),
but are instead dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer.
 This heightens the possibility that a purchaser of Telecommunications Basket SUNS may not be able to receive the promised
payment of 100% of the principal upon maturity. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued
listing standards which require issuers to maintain a minimum aggregate market value of $1 million for its publicly-held
shares.
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Telecommunications Basket SUNS have
at least $20 million in market value.
 In any event, financial information regarding Lehman Brothers, in addition to information on substantially all
of the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket, will be publicly available.









The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Lehman Brothers, or a subsidiary
providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
believes this concern is minimal given the size of Telecommunications Basket SUNS issuance in relation to the net
worth of Lehman Brothers.

The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS should not unduly impact
the market for the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket. First, the underlying securities
comprising the portfolio are either well-capitalized stocks, or in the case of ADRS, represent in dollar terms substantial
market value.
 Second, the all but one of the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket, are
subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and a large percentage of the portfolio securities are either listed
or traded on, or traded over the facilities of, U.S. securities markets.
 Third, the Exchange has surveillance agreements in place for a large percentage of the securities in the Telecommunications
Basket for the sharing of market information.
 This in addition to the Amex's surveillance procedures will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.
Fourth, Lehman Brothers will not include quotations made by or through Lehman Brothers or its affiliates when calculating
the value of the Telecommunications Basket.
 Lastly, the Pricing Agent will agree to restrict information with respect to all calculations of portfolio securities
so that individuals trading such securities on behalf of the Pricing Agent will only be able to receive such information
through public means and not prior to its release to the public.









The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission finds that the proposal, as amended, is substantially similar to the MITTS products which were previously
approved by the Commission for listing and trading on the NYSE. Furthermore, this proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full 21-day comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. Therefore, the Commission
believes it is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on an
accelerated basis.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer
to File No. SR-Amex-93-40 and should be submitted by February 17, 1994.


It is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-93-40) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Amending Its Rules Relating to Suspension of Registration of Specialists, Odd-Lot Dealers and Market Makers</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



I. Introduction



On July 28, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend the suspension of registration provisions for specialists, odd-lot dealers, and
market makers. On August 19, 1993, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release 32888 (September 14, 1993),
58 FR 49341 (September 22, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal.



II. Description of the Proposal



The CHX proposes to amend four Exchange Rules
 thereby making two primary changes to the rules governing summary suspension of the registration of specialists,
odd-lot dealers and market makers. The Exchange proposes to add market makers to the list of members who may have their
registration summarily suspended, and it proposes to limit the authority to summarily suspend the registration
of specialists, odd-lot dealers and market makers to the President of the Exchange.





Currently, unlike the case of specialists and odd-lot dealers, there is no authority to summarily suspend the registration
of a market maker. Current Exchange Rules dealing with market maker registration only provide for the termination
or suspension of a market maker pursuant to Article XVII by the Floor Procedure Committee (or other committee appointed
for the purpose by the Board) upon a finding of unsatisfactory performance.
 The current provisions provide for an initial meeting with Exchange Officials to encourage and assist the market
maker, and for a hearing prior to the termination of the market maker's registration.





The Exchange is replacing the current provisions governing the suspension of market maker registration with new
summary procedures for the termination of market maker registration.
 These new summary procedures provide that whenever it appears to, or is called to the attention of, the President of
the Exchange that a registered market maker is violating any of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities
laws or is conducting market maker business in an unethical manner, the President shall, without the necessity of
previous notice, suspend the registration of such market maker pending the opportunity for a prompt hearing on the
apparent violation in accordance with Article XII of the Rules of the Exchange. The procedures further provide that
notwithstanding the opportunity for a hearing, upon imposition of the summary suspension of registration, the Exchange
shall provide notification thereof to the Commission. The affected market maker
 may immediately file a request with the Commission for a stay of imposition of the suspension of registration.
 The proposed rule concludes by stating that the Floor Procedure Committee may suspend or terminate any such registration
based upon a finding, after an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with Article XVII, that the market maker has
not satisfactorily performed his responsibilities as defined in the federal securities laws and the rules and policies
of the Exchange.

The Exchange states that these changes to the provisions governing the suspension and termination of market maker
registration will serve to conform the market maker registration suspension and termination provisions to those
of the specialist and odd-lot dealer.


The proposed rule change also changes current Exchange Rules governing the summary suspension of the registration
of specialists and odd-lot dealers. Currently, the rules allow for summary suspension by either the Floor Procedure
Committee or the President of the Exchange. Such Rules specify that whenever it shall appear or be called to the attention
of any member of the Committee on Floor Procedure or the President that a specialist, co-specialist, relief specialist
or odd-lot dealer is violating any of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws or is conducting business
in an unethical manner, the member of the Floor Procedure Committee or the President shall, without the necessity
of previous notice, suspend the registration of such party pending an opportunity for prompt hearing on the apparent
violation in accordance with Article XII of the Rules of the Exchange.







The Exchange is eliminating the language in the suspension of registration rules governing specialists, co-specialists,
relief specialists and odd-lot dealers which provides that any member of the Floor Procedure Committee may take action
to summarily suspend the registration of such parties. The amended rule, therefore, permits only the President of
the Exchange to summarily suspend the registration of specialists, co-specialists, relief specialists and odd-lot
dealers. This corresponds to the new market maker summary suspension provisions previously discussed. The Exchange
believes that due to the serious nature of summary suspension of registration, this type of authority is appropriately
exercised only by the President of the Exchange.

III. Discussion and Conclusion


The Commission finds the proposed rule change to be consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections
6(b) (5), (6) and (7) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, requires 

inter alia,

 that, the rules of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote
just and equitable principles of trade. The Commission believes that the addition of market makers to the list of persons
who may have their registration summarily suspended will help to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts by allowing
the Exchange to take immediate action against a market maker who is acting unethically or in violation of Exchange
rules or federal securities laws or regulations.




Section 6(b)(6) of the Act provides that the rules of the Exchange should provide that exchange members and persons
associated with its members be appropriately disciplined for violation of the provisions of the Act or rules and regulations
thereunder or the rules of the exchange by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations,
fine, censure, being suspended or barred from being associated with a member, or any other fitting sanction. The Commission
believes that the summary suspension of market maker registration is an appropriate disciplinary action in cases
where the market maker has acted unethically, violated Exchange Rules or the federal securities laws, since specialists
and odd-lot dealers are already subject to such action and there is no reason to distinguish among the three groups.
In addition, recent experience has shown the Exchange that summary suspension authority is needed for market makers
as well as for other exchange members.
Section 6(b)(7) of the Act provides, 

inter alia,

 that the rules of an exchange must provide a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associated
with members. The Commission believes that it is fair to limit the power to summarily suspend member registration
to the Exchange President. The Commission agrees that, due to the serious nature of summary suspension, it is appropriate
to limit summary suspension ability to a senior Exchange official. The rules also provide adequate due process to
persons summarily suspended by providing the opportunity for a prompt hearing on the matter and the ability to appeal
any action taken to the Commission.







It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2)
 of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX-93-17) be, and hereby is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Opening Transactions in Exchange-Traded Options and Duties of Designated
Primary Market Makers</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Currently, Interpretation and Policy .01 to CBOE Rule 6.2, ``Trading Rotations,'' provides that the opening transaction
in each class of options traded on the Exchange shall be held promptly following the opening transaction in the underlying
security on the principal exchange where the security is traded. The rules of the other options exchanges allow opening
rotations to commence following the opening of the underlying security.
 In order to conform its rules to the rules of the other options exchanges, the CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation
and Policy .01(a) to state that the opening rotation in each class of options shall be held promptly following the opening
of the underlying security on the principal market where the security is traded. Under proposed paragraph (d) to Commentary
.01, an underlying security shall be deemed to have opened on the principal market where it is traded if the market has
(i) reported a transaction in the underlying security or (ii) disseminated opening quotations for the underlying
security and not given an indication of a delayed opening, whichever first occurs. In addition, the CBOE proposes
to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide that any member appointed as a Designated Primary Market-Maker
(``DPM'') shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an Order Book Official (``OBO'').





The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<PARENT> FR940127-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change





The CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow opening rotations in Exchange-listed
options to commence upon the earlier of the following events: (i) the report of an opening transaction in the underlying
security on the primary market, or (ii) the dissemination of opening quotations by such market. In addition, the CBOE
proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide specifically that a DPM shall participate in opening rotations
to the same extent as an OBO.


Currently, CBOE Rule 6.62, Interpretation and Policy .01 provides that the opening rotation in each class of option
contracts traded on the CBOE will commence promptly following the opening transaction in the underlying security.
The rules of the other options exchanges provide that opening rotations will commence following the opening of the
underlying security.
 The CBOE states that the other options exchanges interpret their rules to permit the commencement of opening rotations
upon the earlier of either a reported transaction in the underlying security or a reported market quote for the security,
provided that the primary market has not given any indication of a delayed opening. The CBOE's proposal is designed
to conform the commencement of opening rotations at the CBOE to that of the other options exchanges, thereby alleviating
the risk of inter-market pricing disparities.






In addition, the proposal modifies Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide specifically that any member appointed
as a DPM shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an OBO. The CBOE believes that this amendment states
expressly what is implied by paragraph (c) of CBOE Rule 8.80, ``Modified Trading System,'' which provides, in part,
that when acting as an OBO in appointed options classes, the DPM shall fulfill all obligations associated with the
OBO's functions.



The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to clarify the meaning of existing CBOE rules
and to conform the CBOE's rules to the rules of the other options exchanges, thereby contributing to a fair and orderly
market.






(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition





The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.





(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others





No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.






III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action





The CBOE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act. The CBOE states that the proposal is intended to minimize the risk of pricing disparities at the opening
of trading on the Exchange. With the expansion of multiple trading of options as provided in Rule 19c-5 of the
Act, the CBOE believes it is imperative that the CBOE conform the commencement of its opening rotations to the procedures
of the other options exchanges. In addition, the CBOE states that its proposal raises no new regulatory concerns because
the Exchange is adopting procedures that have been adopted previously by the other options exchanges.




The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) thereunder
 in that the proposal is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by conforming
the CBOE's opening procedures to those of the other options exchanges. Specifically, the CBOE's proposal will allow
the Exchange to commence opening rotations upon the earlier of either a reported transaction in the underlying security
or a reported market quote for the security (provided that the primary market has not indicated a delayed opening),
rather than waiting for an opening transaction in the underlying security, as required currently under CBOE Rule
6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01.








The Commission believes that the proposed rule change should help to alleviate the risk of pricing disparities among
the options exchanges and should allow the CBOE to compete effectively with the other options exchanges for order
flow.

<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00105 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, by allowing the CBOE to commence opening rotations after the opening of the underlying security on the
primary market where it is traded, the Commission believes that the proposal should decrease the time required to
obtain opening market quotations and should allow free trading to commence as quickly as possible after the opening.
As the Commission has noted in the past, expedited free trading will allow market makers to engage in hedging strategies
as soon as possible after the opening and will result in the prompt execution of customer orders.





The Commission also believes that the proposal clarifies Interpretation and Policy .01 and CBOE Rule 8.80(c) by providing
specifically that a DPM shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an OBO, thereby eliminating potential
confusion concerning the obligations of a DPM during opening rotations.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

 because the proposal amends the CBOE's rules to conform the CBOE's opening rotations to the procedures used on the
other options exchanges. The Commission does not believe that the CBOE's proposal raise new regulatory issues. In
addition, the Commission finds good cause for approving the CBOE's amendment regarding the obligations of DPMs under
CBOE Rule 6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01 because the amendment clarifies the existing obligations of DPMs under
CBOE Rule 8.80.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by February 17, 1994.


It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-93-41), is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to
Suitability of Recommendations</DOCTITLE>



January 21, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to strengthen
the MRSB's rules governing customer suitability. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on
the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Board is filing amendments to rule G-19, concerning suitability of recommendations and rule G-8 concerning
recordkeeping. The proposed rule change: (1) Clarifies and strengthens the existing language of rule G-19
that requires suitability determinations to be made when recommending transactions to customers; (2) clarifies
the obligation of dealers to make reasonable efforts to obtain specific types of customer suitability information
for all accounts that are not ``institutional accounts'' (

i.e.

, retail accounts); and (3) clarifies the definition of ``institutional account.''




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below and is set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below.







A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change is designed to strengthen the Board's customer suitability rule. In a letter dated May 8,
1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the Board to review the requirements of rule G-19
on suitability of recommendations.
 In September 1992, the Board published a Request for Comments on a number of customer protection issues, including
the application of rule G-19 to customer transactions. After reviewing these matters, the Board decided that
rule G-19 embodies the appropriate general standard for dealers in making recommendations to customers. Nevertheless,
the Board recognized there was a perception that certain provisions of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations
to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended.
Accordingly, at the May 1993 Board meeting, the Board approved a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify
and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G-19. The draft amendments were approved at the November
1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the proposed rule change.







Rule G-19 generally requires that, before making any recommendation to a customer, a dealer must first determine
that the proposed transaction is suitable for the customer. To strengthen rule G-19, the proposed rule change
eliminates two provisions from the rule which, in effect, are exceptions to this general requirement. The first such
provision permits a dealer to make a recommendation when a customer refuses to provide sufficient information about
himself for the dealer to determine that the recommendation is suitable for the customer. The provision states that
a recommendation can go forward in this case as long as the dealer has no reasonable grounds to believe and does not believe
that the recommendation is unsuitable (the ``not unsuitable'' provision). Although the Board did not conclude that
this provision was the cause of customer protection problems (

i.e.

, there was no evidence that dealers relied on this provision to make unsuitable recommendations), the Board believed
that the provision should be deleted to avoid any ambiguities regarding a dealer's obligation to make a suitability
determination. Eliminating the provision also will prevent any future use of the provision as an excuse for unsuitable
recommendations.

<TEXT>
 

The second provision of rule G-19 that is removed by the proposed rule change provides that a dealer, notwithstanding
its determination that a transaction is not suitable for a customer, may, after so informing the customer of this,
nevertheless respond to the customer's requests for investment advice and execute transactions at the direction
of the customer. This ``notwithstanding'' provision allows dealers to recommend specific municipal securities
to investors who want to invest in municipal securities even after being informed by the dealer that, based on their
financial circumstances, investments in municipal securities would not be suitable. While there have been no reported
problems associated with this provision, the Board, nevertheless, believed that this exemptive provision also
should be deleted to strengthen the suitability rule.


The Board also reviewed and clarified the customer data inquiries that are necessary for non-institutional and institutional
accounts. For non-institutional (

i.e.

, retail) accounts, the proposed rule change clarifies that dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain the following
information: the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and such other information used
or considered to be reasonable and necessary by the dealer in making recommendations to the customer. For some institutional
customers, however, these specific information requests may not be appropriate. For example, the ``tax status''
of a tax-exempt bond fund generally is not relevant to a suitability determination. Therefore, the proposed rule
change does not provide a specific list of items that must be requested from all institutional accounts, but does state
that dealers must obtain appropriate and sufficient data from each institutional customer to make a suitability
determination for each transaction that is recommended (as also is required for non-institutional accounts).


Finally, the proposed rule change revises the definition of ``institutional account'' contained in rule G-8.
This definition is used in rule G-19, by cross-reference. This amendment would make the Board's definition
of institutional account the same as the National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'') definition for
purposes of suitability determinations. Accounts that do not qualify as ``institutional accounts'' (

i.e.

, retail accounts) would be subject to the specific information inquiries described above.


The Board believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act which provides that
the Board's rules:




be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade * * * to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal
securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.





The Board believes that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the public interest because it is designed
to ensure that dealers, before making a recommendation to a customer, make a determination that the municipal securities
transaction is suitable.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




Because the proposed rule change will have an equal impact on all dealers, the Board believes that the proposed rule
change will not have any impact on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



September 1992 Request for Comments




In September 1992, as part of the Board's general review of customer protection measures, the Board requested comment
on potential problem areas in the municipal securities market and suggestions for how customer protection could
be improved. Specific questions were asked about the effectiveness of rule G-19 and the Board obtained various
comments on the ``not unsuitable'' provision of rule G-19 from Merrill Lynch, North American Securities Administrators
Association, Barre & Co., Griffen, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, and the Public Securities Association.


While some of these commentators at that time believed that the ``not unsuitable'' provision should be deleted, other
commentators believed it should be retained because some customers do not wish to provide certain information about
themselves. Specifically, two commentators believed that removing the provision would not be a problem and would
make the Board's rule consistent with normal practice in other securities markets. Three commentators noted that
some customers do not want to provide their financial information to a dealer. One of those commentators indicated,
however, that ``in the vast majority of cases, dealers do routinely obtain information for each customer account
reflecting net worth, income level and investment objectives.''

August 1993 Request for Comments


In August 1993, the Board published for comment the proposed rule change. Comment letters were received from Fidelity
Investments, First Interstate Bank of Oregon, Heitner Corporation, Lehman Brothers, Liberty Bank and Trust Company
of Tulsa, Merrill Lynch, and the Securities Department of Arkansas.


Comments on the General Approach of the Proposed Rule Change


In general, the commentators' reaction to the approach taken by the proposed rule change was favorable. One commentator
agreed with the Board's approach by stating that the proposed rule change would address a ``difficult problem'' by
deleting the ``not unsuitable'' and ``notwithstanding'' provisions from the current suitability rule. Another
commentator noted that rule G-19 ``as reformulated by the Board sets forth an appropriate affirmative standard.''
Two other commentators also expressed general support for the approach taken by the proposed rule change.
Two commentators expressed reservations over removal of the ``not unsuitable'' and the ``notwithstanding'' provisions.
One commentator opposed both changes because of its belief that the majority of its customers are not willing ``to
divulge their financial strength.'' Another commentator, while indicating that it does not make recommendations
in municipal securities to customers, also believes that the ``notwithstanding'' provision should be retained
because a customer may disagree with a dealer's opinion of unsuitability. That commentator indicated that dealers
should be permitted to make recommendations to a customer who has already decided to purchase a municipal security
and who asks for assistance in choosing an issue, even if the transaction would be unsuitable for the customer.
While the ``not unsuitable'' and the ``notwithstanding'' provisions were initially adopted by the Board in the late
1970s for reasons similar to those cited by the commentators, the Board notes that there have been significant changes
in the municipal securities market since that time. The number of retail investors has increased and the introduction
of increasing numbers of complex, and in some cases, speculative municipal securities has become a characteristic
of today's market. In such an environment, the Board believes that it is critical that dealers have clear policies
to ensure that sales personnel do not recommend securities to customers without first establishing the suitability
of the transaction. Therefore, the Board believes that the proposed rule change deleting these provisions is necessary.

Comments on Specific Provisions of the Proposed Rule Change



Commentators offered several specific suggestions and sought guidance from the Board in a number of areas of the proposed
rule change.



Customer Account Data and Suitability Determinations



The proposed rule change includes an amendment to rule G-19(b) which states that, for retail customers, prior
to making a recommendation a dealer must ``make reasonable effort to obtain information concerning: (i) The customer's
financial status; (ii) the customer's tax status; (iii) the customer's investment objectives; and (iv) such other
information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by such broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer
in making recommendations to the customer.'' Two commentators were concerned as to what would happen if all such information
could not be obtained. As indicated in the Request for Comments, the language of the proposed rule change does not necessarily
preclude a dealer from making a recommendation if all items of information enumerated in the proposed amendment to
rule G-19(b) cannot be obtained. Given the nature of the transaction (

e.g., 

the nature of the security and the known items of information about the customer), the dealer may have enough customer
data to make a specific, affirmative suitability determination for the recommendation, even if the customer refuses
to provide some of the requested information. However, reasonable efforts must be made to obtain all customer information
listed in the proposed amendment to rule G-19(b), in any event.

As noted above, the amount of customer information that is required to make a suitability determination depends in
part upon the nature of the transaction recommended. With respect to some types of transactions_for example, those
in more speculative securities_the amount of information needed to make a suitability determination will be greater
than if a more conservative recommendation is being made. One commentator requested that the Board provide guidance
on this subject by specifying ``core'' suitability information that must be obtained from a customer even when making
a ``conservative'' recommendation. That commentator also requested that the Board provide specific guidance on
what would be considered ``more speculative'' securities for which more detailed customer account data would be
needed.

The proposed rule change to rule G-19(b) states that dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain certain
``core'' customer suitability data for recommendations to non-institutional customers including: (i) The customer's
financial status; (ii) the customer's tax status; (iii) the customer's investment objectives; and (iv) such other
information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by such broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer
in making recommendations to the customer. The Board notes that if, after reasonable efforts, a dealer cannot obtain
all such information regarding a customer, but nevertheless desires to proceed with a ``conservative'' transaction,
the dealer must exercise its judgment, based on known information about the customer and the security, as to whether
a suitability determination can be made. Furthermore, all information about the customer that is used in making this
determination must be recorded in the customer account record under rule G-8(a)(xi)(F).

The Board also believes it to be inadvisable to attempt to provide detailed guidance on whether a particular security
or proposed transaction is more ``conservative'' or more ``speculative.'' The Board notes that dealers will have
to make such decisions based on their knowledge of the security and the risks involved in the transaction. Attempts
to state a universally applicable formula for such considerations could encourage the substitution of simplistic
guidelines for the broader judgment that is sometimes required to determine whether a proposed municipal securities
transaction includes a relatively low or high degree of risk.



Unsolicited Transactions



Several commentators requested that the Board provide guidance on how to identify and document ``unsolicited''
transactions, 

i.e., 

transactions that are not recommended. Neither the current version of rule G-19 nor the proposed rule change
precludes dealers from executing specific transactions at the request of customers, where no recommendation is
made. Thus, the suitability requirements of the proposed rule change would not apply to such ``unsolicited'' transactions.
The Board notes, however, that most municipal securities transactions are made in connection with recommendations.
Because of its concern with customer protection and in recognition of the special characteristics of the municipal
securities market, the Board views the term ``recommendation'' (and the application of the Board's suitability
requirement) broadly. For example, with respect to transactions occurring after investment seminars and in response
to a dealer's advertisements, the Board has indicated that the suitability requirements of G-19 apply ``in
the same way they apply to all other recommendations made to customers.'' Thus, although transactions may, in some
instances, be ``unsolicited'' if a customer places an order for a specific security, transactions cannot be considered
unsolicited if the order occurs after a dealer has mentioned a specific security to a customer (

e.g., 

in a listing of offerings, an advertisement or in any other communication by the dealer to the customer).

One commentator asked how ``unsolicited'' orders should be specified in a dealer's records, and whether such orders
should always be handled by the dealer ``as agent.'' Board rules do not require dealers to handle specific types of
orders as either principal or agent. Rule G-8(a)(vi), however, specifies the recordkeeping requirements
for the terms and conditions of an agency order, including the fact that it is an agency order. Similarly, rule G-15(a)(vii)
requires the confirmation to state the agency role of a dealer in a transaction. Neither rule G-8 nor rule G-15
has provisions for documenting orders as ``unsolicited.''

As previously noted, the Board believes that relatively few transactions in municipal securities actually are ``unsolicited.''
While documenting these relatively rare transactions as such on the confirmation and in the dealer's records may
be prudent for the dealer's own protection, the Board is concerned that incorporating a requirement in the Board's
rules might have the unintended and undesired effect of encouraging the classification of transactions as ``unsolicited,''
even when they are not ``unsolicited'' under Board rules.



Institutional Accounts



The Board received several comments concerning the proposed definition for institutional account contained in
the proposed rule change and the more generally stated suitability standard for institutional accounts. No commentator
argued that it was inappropriate to distinguish between institutional and non-institutional investors when obtaining
customer account data and making suitability determinations. One commentator believed the proposed standard for
institutional investors was appropriate and noted that the information relevant to a suitability determination
for a specific institutional account is necessarily a matter of judgment for the dealer. One commentator, however,
suggested the establishment of specific minimum requirements for institutional accounts and specifically suggested
that dealers should document the customer's investment objectives (including credit quality and maturity standards)
and ``other information'' used or considered reasonable or necessary by the dealer. Another commentator suggested
including corporate resolutions, trading authorization, and yearly audited financial statements as required
information for institutional customers.

As indicated by several commentators, it is often necessary or advisable to obtain specific kinds of information
from an institutional investor. Rule G-8(a)(xi)(F) currently requires that the customer suitability information
used to make a suitability determination be recorded in the customer account record. The proposed rule change to rule
G-8 also makes this requirement clear. In addition, rule G-8(a)(xi) also requires other customer account
information including, among other things, the customer's name and address, tax identification or social security
number and with respect to discretionary accounts, the customer's written authorization. For various types of institutional
accounts, it may be advisable for dealers to obtain certain additional data and documentation. Often this additional
documentation may be necessary for the dealer's own protection (

e.g.

, trading authorizations). Similarly, for certain institutional accounts, dealers may wish to obtain yearly audited
financial statements where assurance is desired that the account is and remains an institutional account for the
purpose of rule G-19.

Because of the wide variety in the types of institutional accounts and the documentation that might be necessary to
establish suitability or otherwise considered to be necessary and prudent by the dealer, the Board believes that
dealers ultimately will have to employ a certain degree of judgment in determining what information and documentation
should be obtained and recorded for specific institutional customers beyond that now required by rule G-8(a)(xi).

One commentator noted that, in many instances, a suitability determination should be made on the basis of the investment
objectives articulated by an institution for a specific transaction or a specific component of a large investment
portfolio. In these cases, the overall investment objectives of the institution or portfolio may not be the deciding
factor in determining suitability. The Board notes that this view is consistent with the current language of rule
G-19 and the proposed rule change, which requires that a dealer have reasonable grounds for recommending a transaction
``based on the facts disclosed by such customer or otherwise known about such customer.'' Clearly, if specific portfolio
or transaction objectives are given, the proposed rule change and current Board rules require that such information
be used to make a suitability determination and be recorded pursuant to rule G-8(a)(xi)(F).

One commentator preferred the Commission's definition of ``accredited investor'' to the definition of ``institutional
account'' in the proposed rule change. The Commission's accredited investor definition includes a wide range of
investors, such as any private business development company or individuals making in excess of $200,000 per year
for three years. The term ``accredited investor'' is used as part of an exemptive provision from certain registration
requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. Having a customer classified as an ``accredited investor,'' however,
does not excuse dealers from obtaining specific customer account data when making recommendations in equity transactions.
Moreover, because ``institutional account''_rather than ``accredited investor''_is used by the NASD to define
a dealer's customer account requirements, the Board believes that the use of a different test for municipal securities
transactions would complicate the internal recordkeeping requirements of most securities firms.



Transactions With Investment Advisors



Two commentators requested clarification of the suitability requirements that exist when a dealer executes a transaction
for an investment advisor. The Board notes that this question is answered by determining who the dealer's customer
is_the investment advisor or the investment advisor's client. The Board believes that, in general, the investment
advisor will be the dealer's customer. However, it is not possible to state this as an ironclad rule. The requirement
for establishing suitability may depend on whether the beneficial owner is looking to the dealer or exclusively to
the investment advisor for recommendations on investments. The dealer, of course, should obtain the necessary customer
account data from whomever is the customer. If the investment advisor is the customer, then the dealer would proceed
as with other institutional accounts. However, if a dealer has a dealer-customer relationship with the beneficial
owner and treats that entity as its own customer, then the dealer must obtain the information necessary to make a suitability
determination prior to making a recommendation. In this case, the investment advisor is treated as an interested
party to the transaction.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:




(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the MSRB. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted on February
17, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating To Increase in Continuing Listing Fees</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



On December 8, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to increase continuing listing fees.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33317 (December 10, 1993),
58 FR 66045 (December 17, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal.

Currently, the Exchange's listing fees include an original listing fee, an initial fee, and continuing annual listing
fees.

The NYSE is instituting a rate increase with respect to continuing listing fees as follows:






The NYSE states that the purpose of the increase to continuing listing fees is to offset in part the increased costs
of supplying services provided by the Exchange. These costs include manpower, automation, utilities and other costs
associated with providing marketplace facilities and services.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(4) requirements that the
rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members,
issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities.
 The Commission believes that the increases in continuing listing fees are equitable because the increases should
not result in an excessive allocation of NYSE fees on its issuers as opposed to members and other persons using its facilities.
The Commission further finds that the fees are reasonable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset
rising costs. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change.








It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-93-42) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Definition of Index Group</DOCTITLE>



January 21, 1994.



On July 26, 1993, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 a proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-93-16) relating to the definition of ``index group.'' The
Commission published notice of this proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1993.
 No public comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
change.






I. Description



The proposed rule change modifies the definition of index group in OCC's By-Laws to accommodate the development of
new types of stock indexes being introduced by the exchanges.






Article XVII, Section 1 of OCC's By-Laws currently defines the term index group as ``a group of securities whose inclusion
and relative representation in group is determined by the inclusion and relative representation of their current
market prices in a securities index specified by an Exchange.'' To ensure that the definition of index group encompasses
all currently traded indexes as well as other types of indexes that may be developed by the exchanges in the future,
the proposed rule change will omit from the current definition of index group any reference to market price as the method
for determining the relative representation of a stock within an index. Instead, the term index group will be more
broadly defined as ``a group of securities whose inclusion and relative representation in the group is determined
by their inclusion and relative representation in a securities index specified by an Exchange.'' This change is intended
to clarify that an index need not be based on a strictly proportional representation of the market prices of the index's
component stocks.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A thereunder.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) provides, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency must be designed to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions.
 By broadly defining the term index group and thereby clarifying that present and future exchange-listed indexes
will be included thereunder, the proposal helps to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system
for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.






III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular
with Section 17A thereunder.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-93-16) be,
and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Revising
Its Market-Maker Account Structure</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



I. Introduction



On September 11, 1990, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-90-11)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934
 to revise OCC's market-maker account structure. Notice of OCC's proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 12, 1990.
 On July 10, 1991, and on March 13, 1992, OCC filed Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, respectively.
 Both amendments were technical in nature and did not require republication of notice of filing. No written comments
were received. As discussed below, the Commission is approving OCC's proposal.







II. Description



A. In General



The proposed rule change authorizes OCC to exclude from a clearing member's combined market-makers' account the
exchange transactions and positions of market-makers, specialists, or registered traders that are directly or
indirectly related to or associated with the carrying clearing member (``associated market-makers'').
 Positions excluded from the combined market-makers' account as a result of this proposal can be maintained by the
clearing member either in a separate market-maker's account (that is specifically limited to the positions of the
clearing member) or in a proprietary market-maker account under certain circumstances as described below.





B. Exclusion of Associated Market-Makers From the Combined Market-Makers' Account

Section 3(c) of Article VI of OCC's By-Laws permits a clearing member to maintain a combined market-makers' account.
A combined market-makers' account is confined to the exchange transactions and positions of market-makers who have
consented to the commingling of their positions with those of other market-makers. Currently, section 3(c) specifically
prohibits the carrying clearing member from participating in its combined market-makers' account, and OCC's market-makers'
account agreement prohibits non-customers of the carrying clearing member from participating in the carrying clearing
member's combined market-makers' account.
``Non-customer'' is defined in Article I, Section N(1) of OCC's By-Laws to include the clearing member, any general
or special partner of the clearing member, any officer or director of the clearing member, or any participant, as such,
in any joint, group, or syndicate account with the clearing member or with any partner, officer, or director of the
clearing member. This definition was drafted to encompass, in addition to the clearing member itself, only those
categories of persons who are specifically excluded from the definition of customer in the Commission's hypothecation
rules.
 Because OCC's definition of non-customer is so narrowly drafted, OCC's rules currently permit a market-maker that
is closely related to its carrying clearing member to commingle its positions with the positions of market-makers
that are unrelated to the carrying clearing member in the carrying clearing member's combined market makers' account.




In light of its experience during the 1989 market break, OCC believes that the commingling of positions of associated
market-makers with those of unrelated market-makers significantly increases the risks to unrelated market-makers,
OCC, and the options markets.
 Such associated market-makers may be financially dependent upon the carrying clearing member or may be under common
direction with respect to trading strategies and risk management. In the event of the failure of the clearing member,
the conditions which led to such failure may also lead to the insolvency of the associated market-maker. If the associated
market-maker's positions are carried in a combined market-makers' account, OCC may be unable to separate the collateral
supporting the positions in the combined market-makers' account from the collateral supporting the carrying clearing
member's proprietary positions. As a result, OCC may have difficulty in transferring the unrelated market-makers'
positions and supporting collateral even though those positions continue to be viable. OCC believes that prohibiting
the commingling of the positions of associated market-makers with the positions of unrelated market-makers will
facilitate OCC's ability to transfer expeditiously viable accounts of the unrelated market-makers to other clearing
members in the event of a failure of the carrying clearing member. Consequently, OCC's and the unrelated market-makers'
risk of loss should be decreased.

Accordingly, OCC is amending its By-Laws by adding definitions of ``associated market-maker''
 and ``proprietary market-maker''
 and by including language to prohibit associated market-makers and proprietary market-makers from participating
in the combined market-makers' account.
 An associated market-maker so excluded can maintain its positions in a separate market-maker's account.
 Because each separate market-maker's account is restricted to the transactions of a single market-maker, the positions
of an associated market-maker that are maintained in such an account will not be commingled with the positions of other
market-makers or with the positions of the clearing firm.
 Under OCC rules, a clearing member that maintains a separate market-maker's account for its proprietary market-maker
positions (``proprietary market-maker account'') may elect to have the positions in that account combined with
the positions in its firm account for purposes of margin calculations
 as a clearing member may elect to have its associated market-makers' positions treated as proprietary positions
so that the associated market-makers' positions are combined with firm positions for purposes of margin calculation.










III. Discussion

Section 17A of the Act provides that a clearing agency must be organized and its rules designed to assure the safeguarding
of funds and securities which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible.
 As discussed below, the Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with these objectives. 




OCC's proposal responds to the events surrounding the default of an OCC clearing member on October 13, 1989.
 The defaulting clearing member carried in a combined market-makers' account the positions of an associated market-maker
and the positions of approximately 160 unaffiliated market-makers. One person owned 100% of both the defaulting
clearing member and the associated market-maker. 




Because of the precipitous decline in the markets on Friday, October 13, 1987, OCC issued an intraday margin call to
the defaulting clearing member whose settlement bank informed OCC that it would neither honor OCC's intraday margin
call nor extend further credit to the defaulting clearing member. In an effort to cure the default, OCC directed the
defaulting clearing member to transfer the positions in its accounts, particularly positions that were carried
for unaffiliated market-makers and customers, to another OCC clearing member. Because the associated market-maker's
positions were commingled with those of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account, OCC was
unable to distinguish the collateral relating to the associated market-maker's positions from the collateral relating
to the unaffiliated market-makers' positions in the account. Consequently, OCC was required to direct the defaulting
clearing member to transfer all of the positions in its combined market-makers' account. Although this did not preclude
the transfer, it did make the transfer of the non-proprietary positions more difficult. 

The Commission believes that OCC's proposal will enhance OCC's clearing member monitoring and risk management capabilities
in several respects. As an initial matter, the Commission notes that OCC's current market-maker account structure
permits clearing members to mask proprietary activity by forming associated market-makers and combining the positions
of such market-makers with those of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account. Although
OCC can separate the positions of the associated market-makers from those of unaffiliated market-makers, the present
account structure can complicate OCC's monitoring of clearing member positions. Currently, before OCC can assess
the positions under a clearing member's control, OCC must separate associated market-makers' positions from unaffiliated
market-makers' positions and then must combine the associated market-makers' positions with the clearing member's
positions. By requiring the associated market-makers' positions to be maintained apart from the unaffiliated market-makers'
positions, OCC's proposal should enhance its ability to monitor the positions of its clearing members. 

The proposal also should enhance OCC's risk management capabilities by providing OCC with a more accurate representation
of clearing members' financial condition. Generally, there are two levels of capital supporting the trading and
positions of a clearing member's market-maker.
 However, as the above-described clearing member default illustrates, this may not be the case when a clearing member
carriers the account of an associated market-maker because the clearing member and the associated market-maker
may be relying on the same sources of financing to support their trading activities. Thus, by requiring that associated
market-maker hold their positions either in a separate account or is a proprietary market-maker's account, OCC's
proposal should provide OCC with a more accurate picture of its sources of exposure and the financial ability of a particular
firm to cover such exposure in the event of a clearing member default. 





The proposal also should enhance OCC's ability to administer a clearing member's account in the event of the clearing
member's default. If the financial or operational condition of a clearing member makes it necessary or advisable
for the protection of OCC or other clearing members, OCC has the authority to direct a clearing member to transfer some
or all of its accounts to another clearing member.
 However, if associated market-maker's positions are held with the positions of unaffiliated market-makers in a
combined market-makers' account, as in the situation described above, OCC may experience difficulty in separating
the collateral supporting the associated market-maker's positions from the collateral supporting the positions
of the unaffiliated market-makers' positions thereby making the transfer of unaffiliated market-makers' positions
difficult if not impossible. 




IV. Conclusion 


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A. 



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b) (2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-90-11) be,
and hereby is, approved.

 


For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change Related to Cash-Settled Foreign Currency Options</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 26, 1993, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared primarily by OCC. On December 22, 1993, OCC filed an amendment to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated
approval of the proposed rule change.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend OCC's By-Laws and Rules to allow OCC to issue, clear, and settle cash-settled
foreign currency options such as have been proposed for trading by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc (``PHLX'').






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries,
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend OCC's By-Laws and Rules to accommodate cash-settled foreign currency
options such as have been proposed for trading by the PHLX. In general, these amended By-Laws and Rules will apply the
same procedures OCC currently uses to clear and settle transactions in existing options to the clearance and settlement
of cash-settled foreign currency options. However, unlike OCC's procedures with respect to other foreign currency
options, cash-settled foreign currency options will be settled by requiring clearing members to pay to or receive
from OCC the amount of U.S. Dollars that reflects the difference between the spot price
 and the exercise price of the underlying foreign currency.
 Cash-settled foreign currency options that are in-the-money by any amount on the expiration date will be automatically
exercised. Options not automatically exercised will expire unexercised. Clearing members will not be permitted
to submit exercise instructions with respect to cash-settled foreign currency options.






Pursuant to the proposal, the definitions of ``clearing member'' and ``option contract'' in Article I of OCC's Bylaws
are amended to add references to cash-settled foreign currency options. The definition of ``exercising clearing
member'' is amended to make clear that when used with respect to an option that is subject to an automatic exercise,
including cash-settled foreign currency options, the term refers to the clearing member in whose account an option
so exercised is carried.

<PARENT> FR940127-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Article XXII is added to OCC's By-Laws to establish By-Laws specifically applicable to cash-settled foreign currency
options.
 Under Section 1 of Article XXII, the spot price of the underlying foreign currency will be determined by the exchange,
or an entity designated by the exchange, on which such options are traded.
 Article XXII, Section 2 clarifies that holders of cash-settled foreign currency options have the right to receive
from OCC, and writers of cash-settled foreign currency options have the obligation to pay to OCC, the amount of United
States dollars that reflects the difference between the spot price and the exercise price of the foreign currency
underlying such options. Section 3 of Article XXII makes provisions for adjustments in the terms (

i.e.

, exercise price, unit of trading, 

etc

.) of outstanding cash-settled foreign currency options under unusual circumstances, 
 and Section 4 of Article XXII makes provisions for circumstances in which the spot price is either unavailable or clearly
inaccurate.
 Section 3 is similar to corresponding provisions relating to other foreign currency options, and Section 4 is similar
to provisions relating to cash-settled index options.









Chapter XXIII of OCC's Rules is added to establish Rules specifically applicable to cash-settled foreign currency
options.
 OCC Rule 2301 prohibits clearing members from depositing the underlying foreign currency or Treasury bills as cover
in lieu of margin with respect to cash-settled foreign currency options.
 Rule 2302 describes the automatic exercise procedure for cash-settled foreign currency options.

<TEXT>
 

Rule 2303 describes the assignment of automatic exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options. Because all
cash-settled foreign currency options in a series that is in the money will be automatically exercised, an assignment
will be made to each short position in the series. Accordingly, Rule 2303 contains no reference to OCC's Rule 803, which
describes the random assignment of exercise notices.
 Paragraph (b) of Rule 2303 states that OCC shall make available to each clearing member with cash-settled foreign
currency options an Exercise and Assignment Activity Report on the business day following the expiration date. This
report will reflect the clearing member's exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options and its assignments
of obligations relating to exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options. 





Rule 2304 states that the settlement date for exercised cash-settled foreign currency options will be the day immediately
following the expiration date. Rule 2305 states that settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options will occur
by the payment of the exercise settlement amounts from assigned clearing members to OCC and by the payment of the exercise
settlement amounts from OCC to exercising clearing members. Under Rule 2305, OCC may net exercise settlement amounts
to be paid by a clearing member against exercise settlement amounts to be paid to the clearing member to obtain a single
net settlement amount for cash-settled foreign currency option exercises with respect to each account.
 This is consistent with OCC practices respecting other foreign currency options. All exercise settlement amounts
will be paid within OCC's usual timeframes. 





Rule 2306 makes it clear that exercised cash-settled foreign currency options to which a suspended clearing member
is a party, whether the clearing member is an exercising clearing member or an assigned clearing member, generally
will be settled in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2305.

OCC states that the proposed changes to its By-Laws and Rules are consistent with the purposes and requirements of
section 17A of the Act, as amended, because they provide for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions
in cash-settled foreign currency options. The proposed changes also are consistent with OCC's section 17A obligations
to safeguard funds and securities in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



OCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have
been received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section 17A of the Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to registered clearing agencies. In particular,
sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act require that a clearing agency be organized and that its rules be designed
to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding
of funds and securities within its custody or control or for which it is responsible.
 Because OCC will apply rules and procedures comparable to those that it has used successfully in the clearance and
settlement of transactions in other established options products, OCC will satisfy its statutory obligations concerning
safeguarding. At the same time, OCC will provide clearance and settlement facilities for an innovative product to
the foreign currency market. Cash-settled foreign currency options should provide investors with an additional
means to hedge foreign currency portfolios against short-term market risk, should facilitate transactions in foreign
currency options, and should contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. OCC's clearance and settlement
of such options should promote their prompt and efficient clearance and settlement.





OCC also has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because accelerated approval will permit OCC to coordinate its
clearance and settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options with the PHLX's listing of cash-settled foreign
currency options, which are proposed for February 7, 1994. The Commission believes that because OCC will be applying
procedures which have proved to be efficient and safe in the past, accelerated approval is justified. Furthermore,
no negative comments were received when the Commission published notice of filing of the PHLX proposed rule change.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization.

All submissions should refer to File No. SR-OCC-93-10 and should be submitted by February 17, 1994.



V. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that OCC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act.








It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-93-10) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by Participants
Trust Company Relating to the Declaration of a Dividend Payable on January 20, 1994, to Stockholders of Record as of
December 31, 1993</DOCTITLE>





January 18, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on December 27, 1993, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



PTC is declaring a dividend payable on January 20, 1994, to stockholders of record as of December 31, 1993.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to report the declaration of a dividend payable on January 20, 1994, to PTC's
stockholders of record as of December 31, 1993.

By letter dated March 27, 1989, from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors''),
PTC was prohibited from paying dividends to its stockholders. By letter dated June 9, 1992, from the Board of Governors,
PTC was relieved of the restriction on the payment of dividends on the understanding that dividends, if declared,
would be declared periodically by PTC's Board of Directors and paid at a rate not to exceed the 90-day United States
Treasury bill rate in effect at the time the dividend is declared. By order dated January 15, 1993,
 the Commission approved PTC's practice of paying such dividends out of net profits subject to the limitations imposed
by the Board of Governors and subject to the further requirements that (i) prior to using excess income from invested
principal and interest (``P&I'') to pay a dividend, PTC's Board of Directors be advised of any amount related
to the investment of P&I which has not been rebated and is part of the net profits used to declare the dividend, and
affirmatively approve the application of such excess P&I income for the dividend, and (ii) PTC file a proposed
rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act each time it declares a dividend. PTC paid its first dividend
on January 18, 1993, in the amount of $.52 per share, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December
31, 1992.






At its meeting of December 21, 1993, PTC's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $.525 per share, payable
on January 20, 1994, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 1993. This dividend rate does
not exceed the 90-day United States Treasury bill rate in effect on December 21, 1993 (3.11%, as published in The Wall
Street Journal on December 21, 1993). The dividend does not include any excess income attributable to investments
of P&I as all such P&I related income with respect to fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 will be rebated to
participants, pro rata, based on the amount of P&I disbursements to each participant.

The issuance of a dividend under these circumstances advances the requirements of fair representation of shareholders
and participants under Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act in that it provides an incentive for participants to invest
in PTC shares, and is also consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among participants.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


PTC has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. PTC has not received any
unsolicited written comments from Participants or other interested parties.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of
Rule 19b-4 thereunder because it constitutes a stated practice with respect to the administration of an existing
rule of PTC. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate
such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest,
for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested parties are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of PTC. All submissions should refer to file number SR-PTC-93-07
and should be submitted by February 17, 1994.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. Most of the Trusts are series companies that may issue one or more series. Applicants request that relief be extended
to (a) each Trust and each of its series and (b) all other investment companies or series thereof that are, or in the future
will be, (i) advised by FMR (or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FMR) or are, or in the
future will be, distributed by FDC or NFSC (or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FDC
or NFSC) and that (ii) have or will have the ability to issue classes of shares that are identical in all material respects
to those described in the application (collectively with the Trusts and series thereof, the ``Funds'').

2. FMR acts as each Fund's investment manager and also provides the Funds with administrative services. FDC acts as
the distributor of all the Funds, other than the Funds for which NFSC services as distributor. NFSC currently acts
as the distributor to three Funds, each a series of the Daily Money Fund. FMR, FDC, and NFSC are all subsidiaries of FMC
Corp.

3. Applicants previously requested an order under section 6(c) of the Act to permit the issuance and sale of an unlimited
number of classes of securities by the Funds (the ``Existing Order'').
 The Existing Order contained the following permissible class differences: (a) The impact of certain Class Expenses,
as Class Expenses are defined in the Existing Order; (b) the fact that classes will vote separately with respect to
the classes' Rule 12b-1 Plan and/or Shareholder Services Plan, as both plans are defined in the Existing Order;
(c) exchange privileges of the classes of shares; and (d) the designation of each class of shares.





4. The Funds' existing classes of shares are sold subject to a front-end sales load and/or a rule 12b-1 fee. Applicants
now request the ability to offer shares that carry a standard or level load CDSC. The standard CDSC shares will not be
subject to a front-end sales load but will be subject to a CDSC and an annual rule 12b-1 and/or service fee. The
level load shares will have the same features as the standard CDSC shares except that the rule 12b-1 and/or service
fee could be different. Applicants also request the ability to have a conversion feature in connections with the shares
that carry a standard or level load CDSC. With this feature, these shares may, after a period of time, automatically
convert to shares of another class without the imposition of any additional sales charges and will be subject to the
lower rule 12b-1 fee and/or service fee applicable to that class. Applicants also request the ability to impose
a CDSC on the proceeds of certain redemptions of shares ordinarily subject to a front-end sales charge initially sold
without a sales charge.

5. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the
net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents such percentage of the net asset
value of the shares at the time of redemption. As a result, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount which represents an increase
in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for the shares
when purchased. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made
first of shares representing reinvestment of the dividends and capital gain distributions, second of shares held
by the shareholder for a period equal to or greater than the CDSC period, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder
for the longest period of time.

6. In accordance with rule 11a-3 under the Act, no CDSC will be imposed on any exchange by an investor of shares
with a CDSC for shares of another Fund. The sum of any front-end sales charge, asset based sales and CDSC paid by any individual
shareholder on a single investment will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided in article III, section 26 of
the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') Rules of Fair Practice.

7. The Funds request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC in connection with the following redemptions of shares:
(a) Following death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''),
of a shareholder if redemption is made within one year after death or disability of a shareholder, as relevant; (b)
of retirement plan distributions which are permitted to be made without penalty pursuant to the Code, other than tax-free
rollovers or transfers of assets; (c) by current or former trustees or officers of a Fund, or current or retired officers,
directors or Fidelity trustees or employees, and by the spouse of such persons, or by a Fidelity trustee or employee
acting as custodian for a minor child, or a person acting as trustee of a trust for the sole benefit of the minor child
of a Fidelity trustee or employee; (d) by registered representatives, bank trust officers, and employees (and their
immediate families) of investment professionals that have entered into distribution-related agreements with
FDC or NFSC, (e) of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted
by a Fund; (f) by large accountholders holding specified minimums of a Funds' shares; (g) those affected by advisory
accounts managed by FMR or any affiliated company, or by FMR or any such affiliated company itself; (h) those effected
tax-exempt employee benefit plans as a result of the enactment or promulgation of any law or regulation pursuant to
which continuation of the investment in the Funds would be improper; (i) those effected pursuant to each Fund's right
to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the
effective minimum account size; (j) by trust institutions investing on behalf of their clients; (k) by a charitable
organization (as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Code); (l) by a charitable remainder trust or life income pool
established for the benefit of a charitable organization (as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Code); (m) by any
state, county, or city, or any governmental instrumentality, department, authority, or agency; (n) of shares purchased
with redemption proceeds from other mutual fund complexes on which the investor has paid a front-end sales charge
only;
 (o) of shares purchased by an insurance company separate account used to fund annuity contracts purchased by employee
benefit plans; (p) by investors participating in the Fidelity trust portfolios program; (q) of shares purchased
through Portfolio Advisory Services;
 (r) of new or subsequent shares purchased in a Uniform Gifts to Minors/Uniform Transfers to Minors account; (s) redemptions
of shares purchased by contributions and exchanges to prototype or prototype-like retirement plans sponsored by
FMR Corp. or FMR and that are marketed and distributed directly to plan sponsors (the Fidelity IRA, the Fidelity Rollover
IRA, the Fidelity SEP-IRA and SARSEP, the Fidelity Retirement Plan, the Fidelity Defined Benefit Plan, the
Fidelity Group IRA, the Fidelity 403(b) Program, the Fidelity Investments 401(a) Prototype Plan for Tax-Exempt
Employers, and the CORPORATEplan for Retirement);
 (t) in accounts to which banks or broker-dealers which have agreements with FDC or NFSC charge an investment management
fee; (u) of shares purchased as part of an employee benefit plan maintained by an employer whose employee benefit plan
is either subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or would be except for
specific statutory exemptions (``U.S. Employer''); (v) of shares purchased as part of an employee benefit plan maintained
by a US. Employer that is a member of a parent-subsidiary group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)(1)
of the Code); (w) of shares purchased in a Fidelity IRA account purchased with the proceeds of a distribution from an
employee benefit plan, provided that at the time of the distribution, the employer or its affiliate had an account
of a specified size maintained with Fidelity; and (x) of shares purchased by a registered investment adviser purchasing
for its discretionary accounts, provided it has executed a Fidelity registered investment adviser agreement.

1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act
and rule 22c-1 thereunder to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of the shares as described
above and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions. Applicants believe that
the contingent nature of the proposed charge places the purchaser in a better position than if a sales load were imposed
at the time of sale, since in the case of the CDSC the shareholder enjoys the possibility that he or she will have to pay
only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicants further believe that the imposition of the CDSC permits
the Funds' shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their
purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase.

2. Applicants also request an amendment to the Existing Order, which granted an exemption under section 6(c) from
sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), 18(i), to permit applicants to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests
in the same portfolio of securities. The amendment to the Existing Order would permit applicants to add a conversion
feature as a difference between classes of shares. Applicants believe that the conversion feature is equitable and
will not discriminate against any group of shareholders.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:






1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate solely
to one or more of the following: (a) The impact of certain Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following
(i) transfer agent fee identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing
and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses,
and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class
of shares; (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) trustees' fees or expenses incurred
as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (vii) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of
shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Shareholder Services Plan and/or Rule 12b-1 Plan with
respect to such class; (c) the fact that classes will vote separately with respect to the Fund's Shareholder Services
Plan and/or Rule 12b-1 Plan, except as provided in conditions 16 and 17; (d) the different exchange privileges
of the classes of shares; (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund; and (f) the fact that certain classes
will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are
subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until
approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order.

2. The trustees of the Funds, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of different
classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System'') prior to the implementation of that system by a particular Fund. The
minutes of the meetings of the trustees of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the trustees with respect to the
approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determination
that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the Trusts including a majority of
the trustees who are not interested persons of the Trusts. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by the Funds to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of trustees, and the trustees
shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Trusts, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of
shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's distributor and adviser will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a material conflict arises that the trustees determine cannot
be eliminated, the Fund's distributor and adviser, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including
establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. The distributor of each Fund will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.

6. The Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1
(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need to enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

7. The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Shareholder
Services Plans and Rule 12b-1 Plans and the related Service Agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged
to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees
to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Service Payments made
by a class under a Plan and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.

9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered
a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to
such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection
by the Commission staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst,
and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described in SAS No.
44 of the AICPA. The ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applications have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take
immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute
Expert.

11. The prospectus of each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person
entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect
to one particular class of shares over another in the Funds.

12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
of the Trusts with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees.

13. The Funds will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Funds will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset value or public offering price will present each class of
shares separately.

14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that any Fund may make pursuant to
its Rule 12b-1 Plan or Shareholder Services Plan in reliance on the exemptive order.

15. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.

17. If a Fund implements any amendment to its Rule 12b-1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall
take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new
class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class. If deemed
advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New Purchase Class
may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected
in a manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition
4 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase
Class shall be borne solely by FMR, and FDC or NFSC. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal
may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of
the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration
statement.

<DOCTITLE>Equitable Variable Life Insurance Co., et al.; Application for Order</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Equitable Variable Life Insurance Company (``Equitable Variable''), Separate Account I (``SA-1'') and Separate
Account FP (``SA-FP'') of Equitable (together, ``Separate Accounts''), and The Hudson River Trust (``Hudson
Trust'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 17(b) from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act and approval requested under section 26(b)
of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order of the Commission to permit the substitution of shares (``Substitution'') of the Hudson
Trust's Intermediate Government Securities Portfolio (``Government Securities Portfolio'') for shares of the
Hudson Trust's Short-Term World Income Portfolio (``World Income Portfolio'') (together, ``Affected Portfolios'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations



1. Equitable Variable is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (``Equitable
Life''). Both companies are licensed to conduct business in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and
the District of Columbia.

2. SA-1 and SA-FP are registered unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act. SA-1 funds Equitable's
scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts and SA-FP funds Equitable's flexible premium variable
life insurance contracts (``Equitable Variable Contracts''). The Equitable Variable Contracts are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act''). SA-1 has seven investment divisions (``SA-1 Divisions'')
and SA-FP has ten divisions (``SA-FP Divisions''). Each Division invests in shares of a corresponding
portfolio of the Hudson Trust. Therefore, SA-1 and SA-FP each have a Short-Term World Income Division
(``World Income Division''), that invests exclusively in shares of the World Income Portfolio, and an Intermediate
Government Securities Division (``Government Securities Division''), that invests exclusively in shares of the
Government Securities Portfolio.

3. The Hudson Trust is an open-end management investment company of the series type as described in Rule 18f-2
under the 1940 Act and has filed a registration statement under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act, which became effective
March 26, 1985. The Hudson Trust has twelve different portfolios (``Hudson Trust Portfolios'') that are used by the
corresponding SA-1 and SA-FP Divisions as investment vehicles in connection with the Contracts. The
Hudson Trust Portfolios are managed by Alliance Capital Management L.P. (``Alliance''), a subsidiary of ACMC, Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitable.

4. All shares of the World Income Portfolio currently are owned by the Separate Accounts. Of these shares, approximately
50% were acquired by Equitable Variable's general account in exchange for ``seed money'' contributed upon commencement
of the World Income Portfolio's operations on April 1, 1991. All other shares of this Portfolio are attributable to
Equitable Variable Contracts and are, thus, owned by the Separate Accounts.

5. The fundamental investment objective of each of the World Income Portfolio and the Government Securities Portfolio
is high current income consistent with relative stability of principal through investment primarily in fixed income
securities. The World Income Portfolio invests in high quality short-term fixed income instruments denominated
in a variety of currencies, with at least 20% of its invested assets in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments. The Government
Securities Portfolio invests primarily in U.S. Government debt securities with secondary investments in repurchase
agreements and forward commitments related to U.S. Government Securities.

6. Total net assets as of June 30, 1993 were $289.3 million for the Government Securities Portfolio and $10.4 million
for the World Income Portfolio. There were 2,442 Contractowners participating in the World Income Divisions of the
Separate Accounts.

7. The Hudson Trust pays Alliance an investment advisory fee at the following annual percentages of the value of each
Affected Portfolio's daily net assets:

<TEXT>
 

The Hudson Trust pays various fees and expenses, and Alliance pays any other expense not specifically assumed by the
Hudson Trust. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1992, and the six months ended June 30, 1993, the Affected Portfolios'
expenses were as follows:






Contractual provisions limiting fees and expenses to be paid under certain Equitable Variable Contracts existed
when Equitable Variable reorganized its separate accounts into unit investment trust form. Consequently, Equitable
Variable agreed to reimburse certain Divisions which invest in the Hudson Trust for the portion of advisory fees and
other Trust expenses that exceed the contractual limits set forth in these Contracts. These reimbursements are made
by Equitable Variable to such Divisions only in respect of owners of Equitable Variable Contracts that contain such
contractual expense limits. Expenses of owners of Equitable Variable Contracts that do not contain any such contractual
limits are not affected by the reimbursements. Because the reimbursements are prescribed by the relevant Contracts,
Equitable Variable's contractual reimbursement obligations will not be altered by the proposed Substitution.
The expenses of the Portfolios shown in the foregoing table are, therefore, not affected by these reimbursements.





8. The yields for the 30-day period ending August 21, 1993 were 4.79% for the World Income Portfolio and 5.80% for the
Government Securities Portfolio. The total returns for the Affected Portfolios were:






9. The Hudson Trust's Board of Trustees and Equitable have determined that it is in the best interests of the shareholders
of the World Income Portfolio, and the Contractowners who have allocated premiums to the World Income Divisions,
to suspend operations of that Portfolio and the corresponding Divisions for the following reasons. The World Income
Portfolio's expenses, as noted above, are relatively high. Assets are small and declining from approximately $11.3
million on June 30, 1992 to approximately $10.4 million on June 30, 1993, even though Equitable Variable has maintained
its seed money investment of $5 million ($5.1 million as of June 30, 1993). Additionally, the World Income Portfolio
currently is in net redemption and, consequently, making its investment objective more difficult to achieve. This
Portfolio's performance relative to portfolios with similar investment objectives and investments has been below
the median, with a recent ranking of eighth of eight world income funds for the one year period ended June 30, 1993. The
proposed Substitution will, therefore, eliminate a Hudson Trust Portfolio that, because of its small size, is expected
to be unable to reduce its operating expenses in the foreseeable future, that has not historically been able to produce
competitive yields and returns, and that, because of those expenses and net redemptions, is expected to find it increasingly
difficult to achieve competitive investment results.
10. Equitable Variable thus proposes to substitute shares of the Government Securities Portfolio for shares of the
World Income Portfolio. The Separate Accounts will redeem, partly for cash and partly for securities as a redemption
in-kind, all shares of the World Income Portfolio attributable to Contractowners at the close of business on the date
selected for the Substitution. Redemptions in-kind of securities held by the World Income Portfolio will be executed
to the extent that the securities have characteristics consistent with the investment objectives and diversification
requirements of the Government Securities Portfolio. Equitable Variable will request Alliance to review such securities
selected for redemption in-kind to assure that such securities are suitable investments for the Government Securities
Portfolio. Applicants have determined that effecting redemption of shares of the World Income Portfolio and the
purchase of shares of the Government Securities Portfolio partially in cash and partially for securities is appropriate,
based on the overlap between the U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio securities of the World Income Portfolio and
the shorter-term securities eligible for purchase by the Government Securities Portfolio. Securities redeemed
in-kind will be valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and all applicable laws and regulations.

<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Separate Accounts will use the securities redeemed in-kind and the cash proceeds received on redemption of the
World Income Portfolio's shares to purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio. The World Income Portfolio
will process the redemption request, and the Government Securities Portfolio will process the purchase order, at
prices based on the current net asset values next computed after receipt of the request and order and, therefore, in
a manner consistent with Rule 


22c-1 under the 1940 Act. Investments of Contractowners in the Separate Accounts will at all times be fully invested,
the value of such investments will not be changed by the Substitution, and the investment by the Government Securities
Divisions of the Separate Accounts will not be diluted. On the business day following the Substitution, or as soon
thereafter as is consistent with the stated purposes of the proposed transaction, Equitable Variable will redeem
entirely for cash shares of the World Income Portfolio constituting its seed money.



11. Contractowners will bear none of the transaction costs triggered by the redemption in connection with the Substitution.
The full net asset value of the redeemed shares held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the Contractowners'
unit values following the Substitution. Any costs of liquidating the assets of the World Income Portfolio for the
redemption that is part of the Substitution will be reflected in the next asset value at which Equitable Variable subsequently
redeems its shares of that Portfolio. All other expenses of the Substitution will be borne by Equitable Variable and
Alliance. Accordingly, the costs associated with the Substitution will not be borne, directly or indirectly, by
the Contractowner.

12. Contractowners will be given prior notice of the proposed Substitution and will have the option of transferring
the portion of the value of their contract (``Policy Value'') allocable to the World Income Portfolio to any other
Portfolio of the Hudson Trust, without charge. Otherwise, amounts allocated to the World Income Portfolio will be
transferred to the Government Securities Portfolio, also without charge. All contractowners have received a prospectus
describing the policies of the Hudson Trust and its Portfolios and have all information needed to make a decision with
respect to reallocating the respective portion of their Policy Value.

Within five (5) days after the Substitution, Equitable Variable also will send to Contractowners indirectly investing
in the World Income Portfolio written notice of the Substitution indicating that shares of the World Income Portfolio
have been eliminated and shares of the Government Securities Portfolio have been substituted. Equitable Variable
will include in such mailing a supplement to the prospectus of the Hudson Trust that discloses the completion of the
Substitution or an updated prospectus, as appropriate. Contractowners will be advised in the Second Notice that
they may transfer the Policy Value allocable to the Government Securities Portfolio, as substituted, to any other
available Divisions investing in the other Hudson Trust Portfolios, without limitation, without charge and at any
time. The Substitution will not be counted as a transfer under any contractual provisions of the Equitable Variable
Contracts that limit allowable transfers. Following the Substitution, Contractowners will be afforded the same
contract rights that they currently have, including surrender and other transfer rights with regard to amounts invested
under the Equitable Variable Contracts.



Applicants' Legal Analysis_Section 26(b)



1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under sections 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent
necessary to permit the substitution of shares of the Government Securities Portfolio for shares of the World Income
Portfolio.

Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding
the security of a single issuer:




* * * to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such
substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that
it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of
this title.





3. Equitable believes the Substitution is consistent with the interests of the owners of the Contracts. Both Portfolios
have the same underwriter and investment adviser. Notwithstanding investments in different instruments, their
investment objectives are substantially similar in that each seeks high current income consistent with relative
stability of principal through investment in fixed income securities. Additionally, management fees indirectly
paid by the Contractowners after the Substitution will be lower than those incurred prior to the Substitution.

4. Additionally, the Substitution is expected to confer economic benefits on Contractowners because: (a) The World
Income Portfolio's expenses and net redemptions are expected to make it increasingly difficult for that Portfolio
to achieve competitive results; (b) operation of the consolidated Affected Portfolios will result in economies
of scale and reduced operating expenses as a result of lower management fees paid by the Government Securities Portfolio;
and (c) the size of the Government Securities Portfolio, its competitive return and its historically higher total
return and yield suggest that it will offer a more favorable opportunity for achieving a substantially similar investment
objective with more competitive results that the World Income Portfolio has been able to achieve, relative to other
competitive funds.

5. The Contracts reserve to Equitable Variable the right to replace the shares of one Hudson Trust Portfolio held by
the Separate Accounts with shares of another Hudson Trust Portfolio or with another registered investment company,
subject to Commission approval. The substitution right is disclosed in the Separate Accounts' prospectuses.

6. Contractowners will incur no transfer fees in connection with the Substitution. The Substitution will have no
adverse federal income tax consequences for the Contractowners. Additionally, the Substitution will in no way alter
the insurance benefits to Contractowners or the contractual obligations of Equitable Variable. Contractowners
will continue to look to Equitable Variable with regard to their rights under the Equitable Variable Contracts.

7. Applicants consent to the following terms of and the conditions to the issuance of an order granting an exemption
under section 26(b):

a. Shares of the Government Securities Portfolio will be substituted for shares of the World Income Portfolio, whose
investment objective is substantially similar to the investment objective of the Government Securities Portfolio;

<TEXT>
 

b. If a Contractowner that has allocated premiums to the World Income Divisions requests a reallocation of shares
before May 1, 1994, the Policy Value of the Contractowner's Equitable Variable Contract will be reallocated for investment
to another Hudson Trust Portfolio selected by the Contractowner at no cost to the Contractowner;

c. The Substitution will, in all cases, be at net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any
transfer or similar charge;

d. Any expenses and transaction costs triggered by the redemption in connection with the Substitution (

e.g.

, brokerage commissions, custodial fees, accounting fees, etc.) and which are reflected in the net asset value of
the World Income Portfolio shares will be assumed by Equitable as the sole remaining shareholder of the World Income
Portfolio. Equitable and Alliance will bear all other expenses of the Substitution, including legal and accounting
fees and expenses, the cost of prospectus disclosure, this Application and Notices;

e. The Substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of any provisions of the Equitable Variable Contracts
that limit allowable transfers;

f. The Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contractowners or the contractual obligations
of Equitable Variable; and

g. The Substitution will not alter the tax benefits to Contractowners or cause any adverse tax consequences to Contractowners.



Applicants' Legal Analysis_Sections 17(a) and 17(b)



1. Applicants also request an order of the Commission under section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions
of section 17(a) of the 1940 Act in connection with aspects of the Substitution that may be deemed to be prohibited by
section 17(a). Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal, from selling any security or other property to that company.
Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits such affiliated persons from purchasing any security or other property
from the registered investment company.

2. The Substitution may result in transactions prohibited by section 17(a) because of affiliations among the Government
Securities Divisions, the World Income Divisions, and the corresponding Trust Portfolios. The Substitution specifically
may be deemed to include one or more purchases or sales of securities between the World Income Divisions and the Government
Securities Portfolio because the World Income Divisions will purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio
with the securities received by these Divisions in connection with the redemption in-kind of shares of the World Income
Portfolio. Similar issues may arise in connection with the redemption in-kind itself and the consolidation of the
Divisions.

3. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission shall, upon application, grant an order exempting a proposed
transaction otherwise prohibited by Section 17(a) if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction,
including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the
part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment
company concerned, as recited in its registration statements and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and (c) the proposed
transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act. The Applicants represent that the proposed Substitution
satisfies these tests.

4. First, the terms of the Substitution are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person
concerned. The Substitution will be effected pursuant to the Hudson Trust's procedures for valuing portfolio securities
and portfolio securities of the Affected Portfolios are and will be valued in a consistent manner.

Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act permits a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies
or separate series of registered investment companies which may be affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of
affiliated persons, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated
persons of each other, common directors and/or common officers, subject to certain specified conditions. However,
the Substitution will involve the redemption by the World Income Portfolio of securities in-kind rather than for
cash and, therefore, will not meet the requirements of subsection (a) of Rule 17a-7. Nevertheless, the Substitution
will comply with subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 17a-7 because the transactions: will be effected at the
independent current market price, including, where appropriate, amortized cost, of the securities involved; is
consistent with the policies of the Government Securities Portfolio and the Government Securities Divisions; and
will not involve the payment of any brokerage commission, fee or other remuneration. Applicants believe, moreover,
that the proposed transactions satisfy the intent of Rule 17a-7 and that, consequently, there will be no overreaching
because all securities redeemed in-kind and used to purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio will
be consistently valued for all purposes.

5. Second, the proposed Substitution is consistent with the investment policies of both Affected Portfolios because
securities received by the Separate Account from the World Income Portfolio from redemptions in-kind will be selected
by Alliance to correspond to the investment policies of the Government Securities Portfolio.

6. Third, the Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act because it will provide Contractowners
those economic and other benefits discussed herein.



Conclusion



1. Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested under section 26(b) of the 1940 Act is necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Applicants further submit that the exemptive relief requested under section 17(b) is appropriate because the
terms of the proposed Substitution, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and
do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy
of each registered investment company concerned with the Substitution, as recited in their registration statements
and reports filed under the 1940 Act, and the Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.

3. Accordingly the Applicants request that the Commission grant the necessary exemptions and approvals pursuant
to sections 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act permitting the Substitution.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>United of Omaha Life Insurance Co., et al.; Application for Exemption</DOCTITLE>



January 19, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

United of Omaha Life Insurance Company (``United of Omaha''), United of Omaha Separate Account C (the ``Variable
Account''), and Mutual of Omaha Investors Services, Inc. (``MOIS'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Applicants seek an order under section 6(c) of the Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit them to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable
Account, which funds individual flexible payment variable deferred annuity contracts (the ``Policies'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations



1. United of Omaha is a stock life insurance company that was incorporated under the name of United Benefit Life Insurance
Company under the Laws of Nebraska on August 9, 1926. In 1981, the company changed its name to United of Omaha Life Insurance
Company. United of Omaha is engaged principally in the sale of life insurance, accident and health insurance, and
annuity policies, and it is licensed in all states (including the District of Columbia) other than New York. United
of Omaha is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company.

2. The Variable Account was established as a separate investment account under the laws of Nebraska on December 1,
1993 pursuant to a resolution of United of Omaha's Board of Directors. Under Nebraska law, the assets of the Variable
Account are owned by United of Omaha but are held separately from United of Omaha's other assets and are not chargeable
with any liabilities arising out of any other separate investments account or any other business of United of Omaha
that has no specific and determinable relation to or dependence upon the Variable Account. The income, gains, or losses,
realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Variable Account are credited to or charged against the Variable
Account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of United of Omaha.

3. The Variable Account will invest in shares of one or more of the investment portfolios of the Variable Insurance
Products Fund, the Variable Insurance Products Fund II, the Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund, and such other
registered investment companies as United of Omaha may make available under the Policies from time to time (each,
a ``Fund''). Each Fund will be a diversified, open-end management investment company, and may have a number of classes
or series.

4. MOIS will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter of certain of the Policies. MOIS is registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Broker-dealers other than MOIS may also serve as distributors and principal underwriters of certain of the Policies,
to the extent the Policies are sold through alternate distribution channels. Any such other broker-dealer will be
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will be a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. The requested order would apply to any such other broker-dealer.


5. The Policies may be purchased with an initial purchase payment of $5000 on a non-tax qualified basis or in connection
with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment.
A Policy owner may make additional purchase payments of at least $500 each at any time prior to the annuity starting
date. A Policy owner can allocate net purchase payments to United of Omaha's Fixed Account and to one or more subaccounts
of the Variable Account. The minimum amount that may be allocated is $500. Several annuity payout options are available
to Policy owners. In the event that the Policy owner dies prior to the annuity starting date, a death benefit is payable.

6. United of Omaha will deduct a Policy fee of $30 each Policy year. This charge will be deducted at the end of each Policy
year prior to the annuity starting date (and upon a complete surrender) to compensate United of Omaha for the administrative
services provided to Policy owners. Currently, this fee is waived if the Policy's accumulation value exceeds $50,000.
United of Omaha also deducts a daily administrative expense charge from the assets of each subaccount of the Variable
Account. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of .15% of the net assets of the subaccount. United of Omaha
imposes no charge for the first twelve transfers in any Policy year, but may impose a $10 fee for the thirteenth and each
subsequent transfer. A withdrawal processing fee equal to the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn will be imposed
for the second and each subsequent partial withdrawal request during a single Policy year, including certain withdrawals
that are applied to provide annuity payments. However, the withdrawal processing fee will not be deducted on the annuity
starting date if the accumulation value is applied after the second Policy anniversary to provide lifetime annuity
payments. United of Omaha does not anticipate making any profit from these four charges, none of which will be increased.
7. In order to permit investment of the entire purchase payment (net of any applicable premium tax charge), United
of Omaha does not deduct sales charges at the time of investment. However, a contingent deferred sales charge of up
to 7% is imposed on certain full or partial Policy surrenders during the first seven years after a purchase payment
is made to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Policies, including commissions to registered representatives
and other promotional expenses. During the first year after a purchase payment, the withdrawal charge is 7% of the
amount withdrawn. The charge declines 1% per year for older purchase payments withdrawn, and becomes 0% in the eighth
and subsequent years. Each year, the Policy owner can withdraw up to 10% of total purchase payments (less any previous
withdrawals), without imposition of the withdrawal charge. In addition, the withdrawal charge is waived in certain
cases. United of Omaha does not anticipate that the withdrawal charge will generate sufficient revenues to pay the
cost of distributing the Policies. If this charge is insufficient to cover the distribution expenses, the deficiency
will be met from the general account assets of United of Omaha, which may include amounts derived from the charge for
mortality and expense risks.
8. United of Omaha seeks to impose a daily charge to compensate it for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in
connection with the Policies. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
in the Variable Account, and it will not increase. Of that amount, approximately three-fourths is attributable to
mortality risks, and approximately one-fourth is attributable to expense risks. If the mortality and expense risk
charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on United of Omaha. Conversely,
if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to United of Omaha.
9. The mortality risk borne by United of Omaha arises from its obligation to make periodic annuity payments regardless
of how long all annuitants may live and from its obligation to pay a death benefit that may be greater than the Policy's
accumulation value. The expense risk assumed by United of Omaha is that its actual administrative costs will exceed
the amount recovered through the administrative charges.

Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, grant exemptions from the provisions
described below to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the daily charge for mortality and expense risks.
Applicants state that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state further that
the proposed mortality and expense risk charge is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable
and proper insurance charge.
2. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act provides that no payment to the depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
unit investment trust shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense except compensation, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties
normally performed by the trustee or custodian. Section 27(c)(2) prohibits a registered investment company or a
depositor or underwriter for such company from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments on such certificates, other than sales loads, are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications
prescribed in section 26(a)(1), and are held by such trustee or custodian under an agreement containing substantially
the provisions required by sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the Act. Applicants request an exemptive order because
the proposed mortality and expense risk charge is not a bookkeeping or administrative charge allowed by sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2).
3. United of Omaha represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate it for
assuming the risk that annuitants under the Policies will live longer as a group than had been anticipated in setting
the annuity rates guaranteed in the Policies; for the risk that the accumulation value will be less than the death benefit;
and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges.
4. United of Omaha represents that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry
practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon United of Omaha's analysis
of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current
charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. United of Omaha will maintain
at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed
in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey.
5. United of Omaha has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Variable Account and the Policy owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by United of Omaha at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.
6. United of Omaha also represents that the Variable Account will only invest in management investment companies
which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses,
to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate
and approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1.


Applicants' Conclusion


Applicants request exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit them to deduct
on a daily basis a charge equal to 1.25% annually of the assets of the Variable Account for the assumption of mortality
and expense risks described herein. For the reasons set forth above, Applicants believe that the exemptions requested
are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

<DOCTITLE>The Alger Fund, et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>


January 21, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

The Alger Fund (the ``Fund''), any future series thereof, and any registered investment company for which Fred Alger
& Company, Incorporated serves in the future as principal underwriter or for which any person controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with Fred Alger & Company, Incorporated (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of
the Act) may in the future serve as principal underwriter; and Fred Alger & Company, Incorporated (the ``Distributor'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the Act amending previous orders that granted an exemption from sections 2(a)(32),
2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

The Fund previously received exemptive orders that permit it to impose a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'')
on certain redemptions of shares, and waive the CDSC in certain instances. Applicants now seek to amend the prior orders
to permit the Fund to waive the CDSC in connection with redemptions effected by registered investment advisers, banks
and trust companies and other financial institutions exercising discretionary authority with respect to the money
invested in Fund shares and on redemptions effected by registered investment advisers for their own account.

supplementary information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. The Fund is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act. The Fund is a series company currently
composed of seven series: The Alger Money Market Portfolio, the Alger Income and Growth Portfolio, the Alger Small
Capitalization Portfolio, the Alger Growth Portfolio, the Alger Balanced Portfolio, the Alger MidCap Growth Portfolio,
and the Alger Leveraged AllCap Portfolio (collectively, the ``Portfolios''). The Distributor is the distributor
for the Fund.
2. In 1986, the Commission issued an order to the Fund to permit the Fund to impose a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares
of the Portfolios and waive the CDSC in certain instances (the ``Prior Order'').
 In 1987, the Prior Order was amended to include an additional waiver category (together with the Prior Order, the ``Prior
Orders'').
 The present application seeks to expand the circumstances under which the Fund may waive the CDSC. The order sought
by this application will, if issued, supersede the Prior Orders.





3. No CDSC is imposed upon the redemption of shares of a Portfolio to the extent that the net asset value of the shares
redeemed does not exceed (a) the current net asset value of shares purchased more than six years prior to the redemption,
plus (b) the current net asset value of shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions,
plus (c) increases in the net asset value of the shares above purchase payments made with respect to a Portfolio during
the preceding six years. The amount of the CDSC depends on the number of years that the shareholder has held the shares
from which an amount is being redeemed. The Fund assesses no CDSC on exchanges of shares among Portfolios.
4. In accordance with the terms of the Prior Orders, the Fund waives the CDSC on the following redemptions: (a) Any partial
or total redemption of shares of a shareholder who dies or becomes disabled, so long as the redemption is requested
within one year of death or initial determination of disability; (b) any partial or complete redemption in connection
with certain distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts (``IRAs'') or other qualified retirement plans;
(c) redemptions effected pursuant to the Fund's automatic cash withdrawal plan of amounts up to 2% of the value of a
shareholder's shares in a Portfolio at the time the withdrawal plan commences; (d) redemptions effected by (i) employees
of Alger Associates, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (ii) IRAs, Keogh plans and employee benefit plans for those employees,
and trusts of which those individuals are beneficiaries, as long as orders for the Fund's shares on behalf of those
individuals and trusts are placed by the employees; (e) redemptions effected by (i) accounts managed by investment
advisory subsidiaries of Alger Associates, Inc. that are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, (ii)
employees, participants and beneficiaries of those accounts, (iii) IRAs, Keogh plans and employee benefit plans
for those employees, participants and beneficiaries and (iv) spouses and minor children of those employees, participants
and beneficiaries as long as orders for the Fund's shares are placed by the employees, participants and beneficiaries;
(f) redemptions effected by directors or trustees or any investment company for which Alger Associates, Inc. or any
of its subsidiaries serves as investment adviser or distributor; (g) redemptions effected by an investment company
registered under the Act in connection with the combination of the investment company with the Fund by merger, acquisition
of assets or by any other transaction; (h) redemptions effected pursuant to the Fund's right to liquidate involuntarily
a shareholder's account in any Portfolio with a current value of less than $250; and (i) redemptions of shares of the
Portfolios held through defined contribution plans with respect to which Fred Alger Management, Inc. or an affiliate
thereof provides certain non-fiduciary services.
5. The Fund also offers a one-time only reinvestment privilege under which a shareholder who redeems shares subject
to the CDSC and reinvests the proceeds of the redemption within 30 days after the redemption will receive a credit against
the amount of the CDSC paid. The percentage of the CDSC credited to the shareholder is the same as the percentage of the
redemption proceeds that are reinvested. The Distributor will pay any credit from its own assets.
6. In the present application, applicants also propose to waive the CDSC on redemptions effected by registered investment
advisers, banks and trust companies and other financial institutions exercising discretionary authority with
respect to the money invested in Fund shares and on redemptions effected by registered investment advisers for their
own account.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. The requested exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the
additional waiver is appropriate because shares of a Portfolio with respect to which the CDSC would be waived are purchased
with little or no selling effort or expense. In addition, the waiver will encourage sales of the Fund's shares which
will be beneficial to all the Fund's shareholders.
2. Waiving the CDSC is consistent with the policies underlying section 22(d) of the Act, which prohibits an investment
company registered under the Act from selling its redeemable securities other than at a current public offering price
described in the company's prospectus. The waiver will not result in the occurrence of any of the abuses to which section
22(d) is directed and will not harm the Fund or its shareholders or unfairly discriminate among shareholders or purchasers.


Applicants' Condition


Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release
No. 16619 (November 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

Corporation.

4. Applicants request that the relief granted hereby apply to all existing and future portfolios of Laurel Fund, TBC
Fund, TBCIS Fund, and TBCTF Fund (the ``Portfolios''), and to all future registered investment companies distributed
by RFD or FDI, or for which Mellon Bank serves in the future as investment adviser, or for which any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with Mellon Bank (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act) may in the
future serve as investment adviser. Any such future investment companies that rely on the requested relief will abide
by all of the representations and conditions to the application.
5. The Portfolios consist of both money market funds and non-money market funds. Shares of the Portfolios are sold
and redeemed daily at net asset value without a sales or redemption charge. The Funds have adopted plans pursuant to
rule 12b-1 under the Act for using up to 0.35% of each Portfolio's net assets annually to aid in the distribution
of their shares.
6. Applicants propose to create a multi-class distribution system (the ``Multi-Class System''). The Funds will
create an unlimited number of additional classes of shares in some or all of their existing and future Portfolios.
Shares will be issued in connection with either a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act (the ``12b-1
Plan'') and/or a non-rule 12b-1 administrative plan (the ``Administrative Plan,'' and collectively with
the 12b-1 Plan, the ``Plans'').
7. With respect to each class of shares, the Funds will enter into a 12b-1 Plan agreement and/or an Administrative
Plan agreement (the ``Plan Agreements'') with groups, organizations or institutions (``Organizations'') to provide
certain services to the clients, members, or customers of such Organizations who beneficially own shares offered
in connection with a particular class (``Class Shareholders'').
8. The services to be provided by Organizations to their Class Shareholders under the 12b-1 Plan could include:
providing facilities to answer questions from prospective investors about the Funds; receiving and answering correspondence,
including requests for prospectuses and statements of additional information; preparing, printing, and delivering
prospectuses and shareholder reports to prospective Class Shareholders; complying with federal and state securities
laws pertaining to the sale of shares; and assisting investors in completing application forms and selecting dividend
and other account options.
9. The services to be provided by Organizations to their Class Shareholders under the Administrative Plan could include:
receiving, aggregating, and processing Class Shareholder orders; sweep program servicing; shareholder sub-accounting;
providing and maintaining elective Class Shareholder services such as check writing and wire transfer services;
providing and maintaining pre-authorized investment plans; periodic communications with Class Shareholders;
acting as the sole shareholder of record and nominee for Class Shareholders; maintaining account records for Class
Shareholders; answering questions and handling correspondence from Class Shareholders about their accounts;
issuing confirmations for transactions by Class Shareholders; and similar account administrative services.

10. The services provided pursuant to the Plans will augment or replace (and not be duplicative of) the services to
be provided to the Portfolios by Mellon Bank, the Distributors, or FRIMCo. Applicants propose to ``unbundle'' services
provided to the Portfolios to permit Organizations to select services they wish to provide to their Class Shareholders,
with such services to be tailored to their Class Shareholders' needs.
11. With respect to each class of shares, a Portfolio will pay an Organization for its services and assistance in accordance
with the terms of its Plan and related Plan Agreement (``Plan Payments'') and the expense of such payments will be borne
entirely by the owners of the class of shares of the Portfolio to which each Plan Agreement relates. Plan Payments will
not exceed 0.50% per year of the average daily net asset value of shares owned by Class Shareholders covered by such
Plan Agreement. In addition, for any Organization having both a 12b-1 Plan and Administrative Plan, aggregate
Plan Payments will not exceed 1.00% per year. Such maximum limits on Plan Payments might be increased in the future,
upon compliance with the provisions of the related Plan, but will not be increased over the limits stated above unless
the requested exemptive order is amended, or a no-action position obtained from the SEC staff permitting such increase.
12. Applicants at all times will comply with Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc., as amended, with respect to asset-based distribution charges.
13. All expenses of the Funds that cannot be attributed directly to any one Portfolio (``Fund Expenses'') will be allocated
to each Portfolio based on the relative net assets of such Portfolio. Fund Expenses could include, for example, directors'
fees and expenses, audit and legal fees, insurance premiums, SEC and state blue sky registration fees, and dues paid
to organizations such as the Investment Company Institute.
14. Certain expenses may be attributable to a Portfolio, but not to a particular class (``Portfolio Expenses'').
Portfolio Expenses will be allocated to a class based upon the relative percentage of net assets of such class. Portfolio
expenses could include, for example, advisory fees, accounting fees, custodian fees, and fees related to preparation
of separate documents of the Portfolio. In addition, the gross income of each Portfolio will be allocated on a 

pro rata

 basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class, and then divided by the number of outstanding shares
in each class.
15. In addition to the cost of Plan Payments, each class will bear certain expenses attributable specifically to such
class, as set forth in Condition 1 (``Class Expenses''). The determination of which Class Expenses will be allocated
to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be determined by the Board of Directors of the Fund in
the manner described in Condition 3.
16. The Funds' investment adviser may choose to reimburse or waive Class Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary,
temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by the investment adviser may vary from class to
class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to
another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse
or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same portfolio.
17. In addition, the investment adviser may waive or reimburse Fund Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses (with or without
a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Fund Expenses and/or Portfolio
Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Fund Expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited
to each class of a Portfolio based on the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Portfolio Expenses that
are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of that Portfolio according to the relative net assets of the
classes. Fund Expenses and Portfolio Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Portfolio. Accordingly, it
may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund Expenses or Portfolio Expenses at different levels for different
classes of the same Portfolio.
18. Dividends paid to each class of shares will be declared and paid on the same days and at the same times, and except
as noted below, will be determined in the same manner and paid in the same amounts. Because different Plan Payments
and Class Expenses may be borne by each class of shares, the net income of (and dividends payable to) each class may be
different from the net income of the other classes of shares of a Portfolio.

19. Applicants also request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d), of the Act and rule 22c-1
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares, and waive
the CDSC in certain instances. The amount of the CDSC charged will vary, depending on the length of time shares have
been held. 

20. The CDSC typically will range from 4% to 6% (but can be higher or lower) on shares redeemed in the first year of purchase
and will be reduced, typically at a rate of 1% per year over the applicable CDSC period, so that redemptions of shares
held after that period will not be subject to a CDSC. 

21. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares purchased in connection with the reinvestment of distributions.
Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount which represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account
resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. In determining
whether a CDSC is applicable, a redemption will be made first of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions,
second of shares purchased prior to the CDSC period, and third of shares purchased during the CDSC period. 

22. The Portfolios will waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) following a shareholder's death or disability, as defined
in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, (b) in connection with distributions from an individual retirement
account or other qualified retirement plan following death, total or permanent disability, or reaching retirement
age, and (c) in whole or in part in connection with shares sold to: (i) Customers of Mellon Bank Corporation, its subsidiaries,
and affiliates (``Mellon Bank Corp.''), and The Boston Company, its subsidiaries (including The Boston Company
Advisors, Inc.) and affiliates (``The Boston Company''), (ii) directors and officers of the Funds, and (iii) employees
and retirees of Mellon Bank Corp., The Boston Company, the Distributors, and FRIMCo, as disclosed in the registration
statement for the class. 



Applicants' Legal Analysis: 



1. Applicants seek an exemptive order to the extent that the Multi-Class System might be deemed to (a) result in a ``senior
security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (b) violate
the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. 

2. Section 18 is intended to prevent investment companies from issuing excessive amounts of senior securities and
thereby increasing unduly the speculative character of their junior securities, or from operating without adequate
assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Portfolios' existing
assets or reserves. Nor will the proposed arrangement increase the speculative character of the shares of a Portfolio
since all shares will participate 

pro rata

 in all of a Portfolio's income and expenses, with the exception of Plan Payments and Class Expenses. 

3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and will not discriminate against any group
of shareholders. Further, since all shares of a Portfolio will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have
any preference or priority in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences
will respect to particular assets, and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account). 

4. Applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC is fair, consistent with the policy and provisions of the Act,
and in the best interest of those shareholders on whom it is imposed. Shares sold subject to a CDSC will be designed to
permit the investor to purchase shares without the assessment of a front-end sales load, and at the same time permit
the Distributors to pay securities dealers selling shares of a class a commission on the sale of those shares. Proceeds
from the CDSC will be used in whole or in part to defray the expenses of the Distributors and of the selling broker-dealers
relating to providing distribution-related services to the investor choosing those classes. 



Applicants' Conditions 



If the requested order is granted, applicants agree to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical
in all respects, except for differences related to: (a) Certain Class Expenses, which are limited to: (i) Transfer
agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and
postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and
proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares;
(iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of the Funds' administrator and other administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal
expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one
class of shares; and (viii) organizational expenses incurred to establish a particular class of shares; (b) expenses
assessed to a class pursuant to a 12b-1 Plan or Administrative Plan; (c) voting rights as to matters exclusively
affecting one class of shares; (d) dividend and net asset value differences reflecting different Plan Payments and
Class Expenses; (e) class designation; and (f) exchange privileges. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically
identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors will approve the offering of different
classes of shares pursuant to the Multi-Class System. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations
of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail
the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of the
Funds, the Portfolios, and shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of the Funds, including a majority
of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a Portfolio to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review, at least
quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The investment adviser and distributor of the Funds will
be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the investment
adviser and the distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered
management investment company.

5. The Distributors will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.

6. The Administrative Plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

7. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Administrative
Plans and 12b-1 Plans and the related Plan Agreements complying with paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1,
as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing
of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures
not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by a Portfolio with respect to a class of shares will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time,
on the same day, and will be in the same per share amount as dividends paid by that Portfolio with respect to each other
class of shares of the Portfolio, except that Plan Payments made by a class under its Plan and any Class Expenses will
be borne exclusively by the affected class.
9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to the applicants, which report has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that
the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agrees to provide), will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon written request by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or a regional office
of the SEC. Authorized staff members will be limited to the director, an associate director, the chief accountant,
the chief financial analyst, an assistant director, and any regional administrators or associate and assistant
administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined
and described in Statement of Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 44 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(``AICPA'') and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of
effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in Condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing report referred to in that condition. Applicants will take immediate
corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.
11. The prospectuses of each class of a Portfolio will include a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other
person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares may receive different compensation with
respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Portfolio.
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted, and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines to be furnished to the directors.
13. A Portfolio will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services,
fees, and exchange privileges (if any) applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether
all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Any shareholder report to a class of shares which contains
expense and performance data will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes
of shares of that Portfolio. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and
statement of operations, information related to the Portfolio as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each
Portfolio's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such
Portfolio. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable
to any class of shares of a Portfolio, it also will disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable
to all classes of shares of a Portfolio. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or
similar listing of a Portfolio's net asset value or public offering price will present each class of shares separately.
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order does not imply SEC approval, authorization
of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that a Portfolio may make to Organizations pursuant to any
Plan in reliance on the exemptive order.
15. Applicants will comply with proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619
(November 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Material Sciences Corporation, Common
Stock, $0.02 Par Value) File No. 1-8803</DOCTITLE>




January 21, 1994. 


Material Sciences Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). 
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on October 15,
1993 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. 
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for the common stock. 
Any interested person may, on or before February 11, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer No. R-90-006) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 that was manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner stated that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified version of the 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 to its
U.S. certified counterpart, and found that the two vehicles are substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1970 Ferrari 365
GT 2+2, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as

SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the publication by NHTSA of a report concerning ``Door Opening and Occupant Ejection through
Rear Hatches, Tailgates, and Other Back Doors.'' This report analyzes the available data on door opening and occupant
ejection from hatchback cars, stationwagons, sport utility vehicles, and light vans_vehicles frequently equipped
with a rear hatch, tailgate, or other back door_that were involved in towaway crashes. This report was done as part
of the agency's effort to understand the mechanisms of injury in vehicle crashes. It updates a 1990 report on ``Hatchback,
Tailgate, and Back Door Opening in Crashes and Occupant Ejection through the Back Area,'' by adding four more years
of the agency's detailed data on door opening and occupant ejection. The agency seeks public review and comment on
this report.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) announces a competitive grants program for private, non-profit organizations
to develop indigenous, non-governmental, professional, civic, philanthropic, or issue-oriented institutions
and citizen exchange organizations. These projects should link the U.S. organization's exchange interests with
counterpart organizations and groups in Mongolia.



Interested applicants are urged to read the complete 

Federal Register

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals. After the deadline for submitting
proposals, USIA officers may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until final decisions are made.




ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications concerning this announcement should refer to the Mongolian Citizen Action Groups Project. This
announcement number is 

E/P-94-19. 

Please refer to this title and number in all correspondence or telephone calls to USIA.

(3) The capacity to organize and conduct the program, including appropriate orientation activities for the participants;
detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships;
letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures.

USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission of proposals, is recommended. Address inquiries to the
Public Affairs Officer, American Embassy (USIS) Ulaanbaatar, PSC 461, Box 300, FPO AP 96521-0002; telephone:
976-1-329-095; fax: 976-1-320-776.

USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations that have partner organizations in Mongolia or neighboring
regions, which will assist logistically and will contribute to the realization of program goals and objectives and
will themselves be enhanced by the program. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationship by providing
copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals. 

The partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such as local
housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with the organization
of projects.



Materials Development



USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance
the training programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in community action
work or development of not-for-profit, citizen-based organizations might be developed.



Scope



Proposals should limit their focus to citizen-based action groups. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope
will be eligible, but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the
trainers'' models; the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional
associations to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.



Participant Selection



All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and
USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to accept or deny participants recommended by the program
institution.



Guidelines and Restrictions



USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars of only a few days length which are organized as
plenary sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience. It will support conferences only insofar as
they are a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition.
Furthermore, grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research
projects, for publications intended for dissemination in the United States, for individual student exchanges,
for film festivals or exhibits. Nor does this Office provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e., a
semester or more) academic studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums
or for degree-based programs will not be eligible under this RFP.

Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic
Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP.

Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced
in the 

Federal Register

, and may have different guidelines or restrictions.



Funding



The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years
of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.

While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets
for each program component, phase, location or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Please note:
All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid
by USIA directly to the insurance company.



The following project costs are eligible for consideration for funding:



1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs.

2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants
or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the
published federal per diem rates must be used.






Note: 

Grantee staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate.

3. Interpreters: Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division.
Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA
grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets
should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. 
4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits.
5. Consultants. May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally
do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between
the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal.
6. Room rental, which generally should not exceed $250 per day.
7. Materials development. Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop, and translate materials for participants.
8. One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $5-8 for a lunch and $14-20 for a dinner;
this includes room rental if applicable. The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor
of two to one.
9. A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel.
10. 

Audit Requirements: 

The proposal shall include the cost of an audit that:
a. Complies with the requirements of OMB circular No. 1-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
b. Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92-9; and
c. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
a. Preparation of basic financial statements, and other accounting services; and 
b. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
11. Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide the minimum amount
of cost sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution.


Application Requirements


Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the application package.


Review Process


USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet.
Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. Proposals are reviewed by USIS
posts and by USIA's Office of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the
discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant
awards resides with USIA's contracting officer. The award of any grant is subject to availability of funds. The U.S.
Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and development
costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant; should circumstances
prevent award of a grant all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense.


USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.


Review Criteria


USIA will consider proposals based on their conformance with the objectives and considerations already stated in
this RFP, as well as the following criteria:
1. Quality of program idea: 

Proposals should exhibit relevance, originality, rigor and substance to USIA's mission. They should demonstrate
the match of U.S. resources to a clearly defined need.

2. 

Institutional ability/capacity/record: 

Applicant institutions should demonstrate their potential from program excellence and/or provide documentation
of successful programs. If an organization is a previous USIA grant recipient, responsible fiscal management and
full compliance with all reporting requirements for past USIA grants as determined by the Office of Contracts (M/KG)
will be considered. Relevant program evaluation of previous projects may also be considered in this assessment.

3. 

Project personnel:

 Personnel's thematic and logistical expertise should be relevant to the proposed program. Resumes should be relevant
to the specific proposal.

4. 

Program planning:

 A detailed work plan should provide milestones for the accomplishment of each phase of the project and clearly demonstrate
how the grantee institution will meet milestones. In addition, the work plan should indicate how the work plan will
accomplish the overall project goals.

5. 

Thematic expertise:

 Proposal should demonstrate the organization's expertise in the subject area.

6. 

Cross-cultural expertise and area expertise:

 Proposals should show evidence of sensitivity to historical, linguistic, and other cross-cultural factors, as
well as relevant knowledge of target area/country.

7. 

Multiplier effect/follow-on activities:

 Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, to include maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual ties. Proposals should also reflect an institutional
commitment for continued exchange activity beyond the term of the USIA grant.

8. 

Cost-effectiveness:

 Overhead and administrative costs should be kept as low as possible. All other items proposed for USIA funding should
be necessary and appropriate to achieve the program's objectives.

9. 

Cost-sharing:

 Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as direct funding contributions
and/or in-kind support from the prospective grantee institution.

10. 

Project evaluation:

 Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the activity's success. In this respect the applicant should include
a draft survey questionnaire or other technique and a methodology that will be used to link outcomes to original project
objectives. Applicants will be expected to submit intermediate reports after each project component is concluded
or quarterly, whichever is less frequent.



Notice:

TITLE: 

Thai Local Government Project.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) announces a competitive grants program for non-profit organizations to develop
programs in the area of local government/public administration. The project should link the U.S. organization's
international exchange interests with counterpart institutions or groups in Thailand.



Interested applicants are urged to read the complete 

Federal Register

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals. After the deadline for submitting
proposals, USIA officers may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until final decisions are made.




ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications concerning this announcement should refer to the Thai Local Government Project. This announcement
number is 

E/P-94-18. 

Please refer to this title and number in all correspondence or telephone calls to USIA.

(2) Established connections with partner institutions;

(3) The capacity to organize and conduct the program, including appropriate orientation activities for the participants;
detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships;
letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures.

USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission of proposals, is recommended. Address inquiries to Assistant
Cultural Affairs Officer, AmEmbassy (USIS) Bangkok, Box 48, APO AP 96546-0001, Telephone 66-2-286-0900;
Fax 66-2-287-2102.

USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations that have partner organizations in Thailand or Southeast
Asia, which will assist logistically and will contribute to the realization of program goals and objectives and will
themselves be enhanced by the program. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationships by providing
copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals.

The partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such as local
housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with the organization
of projects.



Materials Development



USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance
the programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in local government or public
administration might be developed.



Scope



Proposals should limit their focus to local governance. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will be eligible,
but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the trainers'' models;
the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations
to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.



Participant Selection



All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and
USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to accept or deny participants recommended by the program
institution.



Guidelines and Restrictions



USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars of only a few days length which are organized as
plenary sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience. It will support conferences only insofar as
they are a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition.
Furthermore, grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research
projects, for publications intended for dissemination in the United States, for individual student exchanges,
for film festivals or exhibits. Nor does this Office provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e., a
semester or more) academic studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums
or for degree-based programs will not be eligible under this RFP.

Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic
Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP.

Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced
in the 

Federal Register

, and may have different guidelines or restrictions.



Funding



The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years
of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.

While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets
for each program component, phase, location or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Please note:
All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid
by USIA directly to the insurance company.



The following project costs are eligible for consideration for funding:

1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs.

2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants
or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the
published federal per diem rates must be used.






Note: 

Grantee staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate.

3. Interpreters: Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division.
Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA
grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets
should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. 

4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits. 

5. Consultants. May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally
do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between
the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal. 

6. Room rental, which generally should not exceed $250 per day. 

7. Materials development. Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop, and translate materials for participants.


8. One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $5-8 for a lunch and $14-20 for a dinner;
this includes room rental if applicable. The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor
of two to one. 

9. A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel. 

10. Audit Requirements: The proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: 

a. Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. 1-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions; 

b. Complies with the requirements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of
Position (SOP) No. 92-9; and 

c. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. 

The audit costs shall be identified separately for: 

a. Preparation of basic financial statements, and other accounting services; and 

b. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. 

11. Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide the minimum amount
of cost sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution. 



Application Requirements 



Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the application package. 



Review Process 



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet.
Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. Proposals are reviewed by USIS
posts and by USIA's Office of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.

Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the
discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant
awards resides with USIA's contracting officer. The award of any grant is subject to availability of funds. The U.S.
Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and development
costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant; should circumstances
prevent award of a grant all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense.



USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.



Review Criteria



USIA will consider proposals based on their conformance with the objectives and considerations already stated in
this RFP, as well as the following criteria:

1. Quality of program idea:

 Proposals should exhibit relevance, originality, rigor and substance to USIA's mission. They should demonstrate
the match of U.S. resources to a clearly defined need.

2. 

Institutional ability/capacity/record:

 Applicant institutions should demonstrate their potential for program excellence and/or provide documentation
of successful programs. If an organization is a previous USIA grant recipient, responsible fiscal management and
full compliance with all reporting requirements for past USIA grants as determined by the Office of Contracts (M/KG)
will be considered. Relevant program evaluation of previous projects may also be considered in this assessment.

3. 

Project personnel:

 Personnel's thematic and logistical expertise should be relevant to the proposed program. Resumes should be relevant
to the specific proposal.

4. 

Program planning:

 A detailed work plan should provide milestones for the accomplishment of each phase of the project and clearly demonstrate
how the grantee institution will meet milestones. In addition, the work plan should indicate how the work plan will
accomplish the overall project goals.

5. 

Thematic expertise:

 Proposals should demonstrate the organization's expertise in the subject area.

6. 

Cross-cultural expertise and Area Expertise:

 Proposals should show evidence of sensitivity to historical, linguistic, and other cross-cultural factors, as
well as relevant knowledge of target area/country.

7. 

Multiplier effect/follow-on activities:

 Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, to include maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual ties. Proposals should also reflect an institutional
commitment for continued exchange activity beyond the term of the USIA grant.

8. 

Cost-effectiveness:

 Overhead and administrative costs should be kept as low as possible. All other items proposed for USIA funding should
be necessary and appropriate to achieve the program's objectives.

9. 

Cost-sharing:

 Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as direct funding contributions
and/or in-kind support from the prospective grantee institution.

10. 

Project evaluation:

 Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the activity's success. In this respect the applicant should include
a draft survey questionnaire or other technique and a methodology that will be used to link outcomes to original project
objectives. Applicants will be expected to submit intermediate reports after each project component is concluded
or quarterly, whichever is less frequent.



Notice:

 The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory
information provided by USIA that contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP does not
constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. Government. Awards cannot be made until funds have been fully
appropriated by the U.S. Congress and allocated and committed through internal USIA procedures.



Notification:

 All applicants will be notified of the results of the review process on or about June 1, 1994. Awarded grants will be
subject to periodic reporting and evaluation requirements.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, Public Law 97-394 (96 Stat. 1966, 1976) extends the statute of limitations
governing pre-1966 Indian damage claims 
(28 U.S.C. 2415) which was due to expire on December 31, 1982. A claim subject to the statute of limitations is an Indian
claim for money damages which arose prior to July 18, 1966. Claims against the United States are not governed by this
law, only money damage claims against persons, corporations, states, or any other entities except the Federal Government.
Claims for title to land are also not governed by this statute of limitations. This notice is required by section 5(c)
of the Act. 



Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, lists of all potential Indian damage claims,
which had at any time been identified by or submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of the Interior's
Statute of Limitations Program, were published in the 

Federal Register

 at 48 FR 13698, on March 31, 1983, amended at 48 FR 15008, on April 6, 1983; and at 48 FR 51204, on November 7, 1983, amended
at 49 FR 518, on January 4, 1984. Excluded from these lists were claims which were erroneously identified as claims
and those which had no legal merit whatsoever. 

When rejecting any claim or category of claims included on the published lists, the Secretary must send a report to
the appropriate tribe whose rights or the rights of whose members could be affected by the rejection. The report must
identify each separate claim being rejected, list the names of potential plaintiffs and defendants, if known or reasonably
ascertainable, and briefly set forth the reason or reasons for rejection. A written notice of rejection must be sent
to individual Indian claimants if their identities and addresses are known or reasonably ascertainable from Bureau
of Indian Affairs records. After a report has been forwarded to a tribe, the Secretary must publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 identifying the claims covered in the report. By the terms of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, any right of
action on any claim appearing on the following list of claims, which have been rejected and reported accordingly by
the Secretary, shall be barred unless a complaint is filed in accordance with date established in the 

DATES

 section of this notice. A list of claims which the Bureau of Indian Affairs considers resolved follows the list of rejected
claims. 

This notice is published in the exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant Secretary_Indian
Affairs by 209 DM 8.

Standard grants will be awarded to support basic studies in selected areas of aquaculture research. Consideration
will be given to proposals that address innovative as well as fundamental approaches to the research areas outlined
below that are consistent with the mission of USDA. Program subareas and guidelines are provided below as bases from
which proposals may be developed:



Program Area



1.0 Aquaculture Research



The overall objective of this research program is to enhance the knowledge base necessary for the continued growth
of the domestic aquaculture industry as a form of sustainable agriculture. Emphasis is placed on research leading
to improved production efficiency, increased competitiveness and wise environmental stewardship in private sector
aquaculture in the United States. Because of limited funds for this program, only proposals focused on the interception,
removal, and/or disposal of waste in commercially important finfish production systems will be considered.

Research should be directed towards studies aimed at a systems approach to (1) reduce the impact of waste within aquacultural
production systems and/or (2) the interception, removal, and disposal of waste from aquacultural production systems.
Studies should target the development or the refinement of cost effective waste management systems. Innovative
approaches to reduction and removal of both dissolved and solid waste should be considered. The quantitative and
qualitative characteristics of waste, as a result of feed formulation and feeding strategies, should be considered
in the rational design of control systems and alternative waste management strategies. Mass balance approaches
to understanding the fate of phosphorus and nitrogen in these systems should also be addressed.

Priority will be given to multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional team approaches and proposals with broad application
to the aquaculture industry.



Review Criteria



Proposals will be evaluated by a peer review group of qualified scientists selected in accordance with  3400.11
of the administrative provisions governing the Special Research Grants Program. In accordance with  3400.5(a),
the following selection criteria for proposals will be used in lieu of those which appear in  3400.15 of the administrative
provisions:

Format for Research Grant Proposals


Members of review committees and the staff expect each project description to be complete in itself. The administrative
provisions governing the Special Research Grants Program, 7 CFR part 3400, set forth instructions for the preparation
of grant proposals. The following proposal format requirements are in addition to or deviate from those contained
in  3400.4(c). In accordance with  3400.4(c), to the extent that any of the following additional requirements
are inconsistent or in conflict with the instructions at  3400.4(c), the provisions of this solicitation shall
apply.


Length of Proposal


Grant proposals must be limited to 15 pages, single spaced exclusive of required forms (i.e. cover page, budget form,
certifications), bibliography, and vitae of the principal investigator(s), senior associate(s) and other professional
personnel, and the required National Environmental Policy Act Statement (NEPA Compliance discussed below) with
its supporting documentation. Information should be typed on one side of page only. Reduction by photocopying or
other means for the purpose of meeting the 15-page limit is not permitted. Attachment of appendices is discouraged
and should be included only if pertinent to understanding the proposal. Reviewers are not required to read beyond
the 15-page maximum to evaluate the proposal.


Compliance With NEPA


As outlined in 7 CFR part 3407 (the CSRS regulations implementing NEPA), environmental data or documentation for
any proposed project is to be provided to CSRS in order to assist CSRS in carrying out its responsibilities under NEPA.
In some cases, however, the preparation of environmental data or documentation may not be required. Certain categories
of actions are excluded from the requirements of NEPA. The applicant should review the following categorical exclusions
and determine if the proposed project may fall within one or more of the exclusions.


(1) Department of Agriculture Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 1b.3)


(i) Policy development, planning and implementation which relate to routine activities such as personnel, organizational
changes, or similar administrative functions;
(ii) Activities which deal solely with the funding of programs, such as program budget proposals, disbursements,
and transfer or reprogramming of funds;
(iii) Inventories, research activities, and studies, such as resource inventories and routine data collection
when such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity;
(iv) Educational and information programs and activities;
(v) Civil and criminal law enforcement and investigative activities;
(vi) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other agencies and public and private entities; and
(vii) Activities related to trade representation and market development activities abroad.


(2) CSRS Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 3407.6)


Based on previous experience, the following categories of CSRS actions are excluded because they have been found
to have limited scope and intensity and to have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the
human environment:
(i) The following categories of research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term
effects on the environment:
(A) Research conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse, or other contained facility where research practices
and safeguards prevent environmental impacts;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940127-2-00198 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940127-2-00111 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes
in the environment; and


(C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar
chemicals or biological materials.


(11) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition
and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity.


In order for CSRS to make a determination regarding NEPA, as to whether any further action is required (e.g., preparation
of an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS)), pertinent information regarding
the environmental aspects of the proposed project is necessary; therefore, a separate statement must be included
in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project may fall within one or more of the
categorical exclusions listed above. This statement must include the reasons, with appropriate supporting documentation,
as to why the proposed project falls within a particular exclusion or exclusions. If the proposed project falls within
one or more of the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusion(s) must be identified. The information submitted
in association with NEPA compliance should be identified in the Table of Contents as ``NEPA Considerations'' and
the narrative statement with supporting documentation shall be placed at the back of the proposal.


Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSRS may determine that an EA or an EIS is necessary
for a proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary
conditions or circumstances are present that may cause a project to have a significant environmental effect.

Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program; Fiscal Year 1994; Solicitation of Applications



Purpose



Proposals are invited for competitive grant awards under the Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program
(the ``Program'') for fiscal year 1994. The authority for the Program is contained in section 1668 of Pub. L. 101-624
(the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. 5921). The Program is administered by the Cooperative
State Research Service (CSRS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The purpose of the Program is to assist Federal regulatory agencies in making science-based decisions about the safety
of introducing genetically modified plants, animals, and microorganisms into the environment. The Program accomplishes
this purpose by providing scientific information derived from the risk assessment research conducted under it.
Research proposals submitted to the Program must be applicable to the purpose of the Program to be considered.

Proposals based upon field research and whole organism-population level studies are strongly encouraged. Awards
will not be made for clinical trials, commercial product development, product marketing strategies, or other research
not appropriate to risk assessment. Proposals should be applicable to current regulatory issues surrounding the
ecological impacts of genetically modified organisms, with special emphasis on natural ecosystem consequences.



Applicant Eligibility



Proposals may be submitted by any public or private research or educational institution or organization.



Available Funding



The approximate amount available for support of the program in fiscal year 1994 is $1,700,000.

Pursuant to Section 719 of Pub. L. 103-111 (the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994), funds available in fiscal year 1994 to pay indirect costs on research
grants awarded competitively by CSRS may not exceed 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each award.

In addition, pursuant to sec. 727(b) of Pub. L. 103-111, in the case of any equipment or product that may be authorized
to be purchased with the funds provided under this Program, entities are encouraged to use such funds to purchase only
American-made equipment or products.

Program Description

Under the Program, USDA will competitively award research grants to support science-based biotechnology regulation
and thus help address concerns about the effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the environment
and to help regulators develop policies concerning such introduction. Proposals are invited in the area of biotechnology
risk assessment research as appropriate to agricultural plants, animals and microbes. Emphasis will be given to
risk assessment research involving genetically modified organisms, but model systems using nongenetically modified
organisms also will be considered if they can provide information that could lead to improved assessment of potential
risks associated with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment.
Proposals will be evaluated by a peer panel of scientists for, among other things, science quality; relevance for
current regulatory issues; and intent to advance the safe application of biotechnology to agriculture by providing
new knowledge for science-based regulatory decisions. The development of better methods for field testing genetically
modified organisms will also be considered.


Areas of Research To Be Supported in Fiscal Year 1994


Proposals addressing the following research topics are requested:
1. Development of new risk assessment methods (e.g. monitoring organism escape, measuring biological impacts),
and risk assessment procedures (e.g. comparative analysis of ecosystems, models to predict risks) that could be
used in risk assessment of genetically modified fungi, bacteria, viruses (including animal vaccines), plants,
arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals. Applicants should address the development of such new risk assessment methods
in the course of addressing a specific and defined risk assessment issue, especially as pertains to genetically modified
organisms.
2. Creation of information systems and computer models to support regulatory agency decision-making in regards
to potential impacts to the environment over time (e.g., computer models to describe the interaction of environmental
and
