Restriction on Importation of Meat From Australia and New Zealand



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule amends the regulations entitled ``Section 204 Import Regulations'' to carry out the voluntary restraint
agreements concerning the level of 1994 meat imports from Australia and New Zealand entered into by those countries
with the United States pursuant to section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and Executive
Order 11539, as amended, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has negotiated agreements with the
Governments of Australia and New Zealand whereby those countries have voluntarily agreed to limit the quantity of
certain meats exported to the United States during calendar year 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture, with the concurrence
of the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to carry out such agreements and
to implement such action.



Presently, 7 CFR part 16, subpart A entitled ``Section 204 Import Regulations'' contains provisions governing the
entry or withdrawal from warehouse of certain meats imported from Australia and New Zealand during calendar year
1993. This rule amends subpart A to delete the provisions relating to Australia and New Zealand for calendar year 1993
which no longer are in effect and inserts new provisions to carry out the voluntary agreements entered into by Australia
and New Zealand with the United States for calendar year 1994.

The definition of meat in the regulations encompasses the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States (HTS)
items which are the subject of the voluntary agreements with Australia and New Zealand. In order to prevent circumvention
of the import limitations, the definition also includes meat that would fall within such definition but for processing
in Foreign-Trade Zones, territories, or possessions of the United States. In addition, the regulations impose transshipment
restrictions which prevent the entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of meat from Australia and New
Zealand unless exported from those countries as direct shipments or on through bills of lading or, if processed in
Foreign-Trade Zones, territories or possessions of the United States, shipped as direct shipments or on through
bills of lading from such areas.



Applicability Date



Meat released under the provisions of sections 448(b) and 484(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)
(immediate delivery), and 19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(1)(A) (entry)), prior to January 28, 1994, shall not be denied entry.

This action has been determined to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, this regulation
falls within the foreign affairs exception to Executive Order 12291 and the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect
to proposed rulemaking. Further, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply to this rule since
the proposed rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply.

Exemptions of REA Operational Controls 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to recent amendment of section 306E of the Rural Electrification Act, the Rural Electrification Administration
(REA) hereby amends its regulations governing policies and requirements with respect to controls and approvals
of borrower operations and the granting of lien accommodations and subordinations. These changes apply to electric
borrowers whose net worth exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding balance of loans made or guaranteed to them by REA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This regulatory action is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. The
Administrator of REA has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) does not apply to this rule. The Administrator of REA has determined that this rule will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. This rule is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation, which may require consultation with State
and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule titled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order
12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from coverage under this Order. This rule has been
reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) Will not have any retroactive
effect; and (3) Will not require administrative proceedings before any parties may file suit challenging the provisions
of this rule. 


The program described by this rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.850
Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent
of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325. 



Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 


The existing recordkeeping and reporting burdens contained in this rule were approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), under control numbers 0572-0017, 0572-0032, and 0572-0103.

Background 



Section 306E of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) was amended on December 17, 1993, by Public Law 103-201.
As amended, the section directs the Administrator to issue interim final regulations to minimize approval rights,
requirements, restrictions, and prohibitions imposed on the operations of electric borrowers whose net worth exceeds
110 percent of the outstanding loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA. The section also directs the Administrator,
when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by such borrowers, to offer, without
delay, to share the government's lien on the borrowers' systems or subordinate the government's lien on the property
financed by the private lender. 

In issuing the regulations, the Administrator is authorized to establish requirements, guided by the practices
of private lenders with respect to similar credit risks, to ensure that the security for loans made or guaranteed by
REA is reasonably adequate. REA understands this to mean that it may consider the practices of private lenders in general,
and not just those that have lent or are currently lending to REA borrowers. If the regulations are not issued within
180 days of enactment of section 306E, the Administrator may not, until the regulations are issued, require prior
approval of, or establish any requirement, restriction, or prohibition, with respect to the operations of any electric
borrower that meets the 110 percent ratio. Nothing in section 306E limits the authority of the Administrator to establish
terms and conditions on the use of funds from loans made or guaranteed by REA, or to take other actions specifically
authorized by law. 

Section 1710.7 added by this rule addresses the application of section 306E of the RE Act to REA operational controls
that apply in general to REA borrowers or specifically to REA loans and loan guarantees. The application of section
306E to lien accommodations and subordinations is set forth in new sections 7 CFR 1717.860 and 1717.904. 



Section 1710.7_Exemptions of REA Operational Controls Under Section 306E of the RE Act



This section sets forth the policy established by section 306E of the RE Act regarding REA operational controls applied
to borrowers that meet the 110 percent net worth ratio; the procedures for determining whether a borrower meets the
110 percent ratio; and the specific operational controls that are or are not exempted for such borrowers. 

Borrowers' net worth to REA debt ratios will be determined each year based on data as of December 31, and borrowers will
be notified in writing of their respective ratios by May 1 of each year. If a borrower's net worth falls below 110 percent
or if the borrower defaults on any requirement of its mortgage, loan contract, or any other agreement with REA that
has not been exempted by REA, REA may reimpose exempted operational controls by informing the borrower in writing.


In calculating net worth, deferred current period expenses properly recordable in accounts 182.2 and 182.3 will
be subtracted from total margins and equities. This is the same procedure followed in 7 CFR part 1717, subpart R to determine
whether a borrower has sufficient net worth to qualify for advance approval of a lien accommodation. It is intended
to prevent net worth from being overstated by the amount of deferred current period expenses. The accounting data
used will be based on REA's system of accounts set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved
under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had
been using straight line depreciation. 

Paragraph (c) of  1710.7 lists 13 operational controls contained in the REA mortgage or loan contract that are
exempted for borrowers that meet the 110 percent ratio. These include, for example: The requirement that extensions
and additions to the borrower's electric system financed by the borrower's own funds be included in an REA-approved
construction work plan; requirements on contract bidding procedures if no REA loan funds are involved; REA approval
of construction, engineering, and architectural contracts, and the use of REA standard forms of contracts if no REA
loan funds are involved; higher maximum limits on plant additions that may be made without REA approval if no REA loan
funds are involved; higher maximum limits on the sale of electric power and energy to ultimate consumers without REA
approval; higher maximum limits on the voluntary sale, lease or transfer of any capital asset, without REA approval,
in exchange for fair market value; and REA approval of the selection of a borrower's manager, provided that the borrower
is not in default.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940128-0-00006 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940128-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Two of the 13 exempted operational controls are also exempted for all other borrowers. These are the requirement to
obtain REA approval of the purchase of data processing equipment and system control equipment (except when REA loan
funds are used), and the requirement that distribution borrowers notify REA in writing of proposed changes in electric
rates 90 days prior to the effective date of such rates. The required notification period has been changed to 30 days.


Although the rule exempts REA approval of the selection of a manager for borrowers that meet the 110 percent test and
are not in default, REA wishes to emphasize again the critical importance of the selection of fully qualified and capable
managers. It is the most important of a board of director's responsibilities. REA will shortly be issuing new guidelines
on manager selection. 

For the convenience of the public, paragraph (d) of  1710.7 lists examples of the operational controls and requirements
that are not exempted. The controls and requirements not exempted fall into two categories: (1) Requirements and
operational controls that are necessary to ensure that the security for loans made or guaranteed by REA is reasonably
adequate and that the loans will be repaid, or to accomplish other fundamental purposes of the RE Act, and (2) requirements
imposed on REA or on borrowers by law. 

The nonexempted controls and requirements include, for example, area coverage requirements; following REA construction
standards and listed materials; certain borrowers having to maintain a power requirements study on an ongoing basis;
the maintenance of minimum levels for the Times Interest Earned Ratio and Debt Service Coverage ratio; REA approval
of certain retirements of capital credits; controls on borrower investments; certain borrowers having to maintain
an equity development plan; requirements on maintenance and repair of the mortgaged property; and REA accounting
and auditing requirements. These requirements and controls are believed to be reasonable in comparison with requirements
imposed by private lenders on customers presenting similar credit risks. 

Paragraph (e) of  1710.7 authorizes REA to reinstate exempted controls and requirements if the borrower is
in default on any requirement of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA that has not been
exempted. REA will notify the borrower in writing of the reinstatement, and it will remain in effect until REA determines
that it is no longer needed to help ensure loan security. 

Paragraph (f) is intended to make it clear that if controls are reinstated because the borrower defaults or its net
worth drops below 110 percent of outstanding REA debt, the controls and approval rights will apply to all applicable
subsequent actions by the borrower, including REA approval of amendments to contracts entered into by the borrower
while it was exempt from controls. 



Section 1717.860_Lien Accommodations and Subordinations Under Section 306E of the RE Act



Section 1717.860 promulgates the requirements of section 306E of the RE Act as they relate to lien accommodations
and subordinations. In determining which borrowers qualify under the 110 percent net worth to REA debt criterion,
the same calculations and procedures are used as in  1710.7, except that the determination is made at the time
of an application for a lien accommodation or subordination and there is no annual notice to borrowers. 

Paragraph (c) of  1717.860 establishes that REA will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination
for financing of capital investments by borrowers that meet the 110 percent test, if the borrower is in compliance
with all requirements of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been exempted
pursuant to REA regulations, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by
REA will remain reasonably adequate. The paragraph also lists the information that must be included in the application
for the lien accommodation or subordination.

<DOCNO> FR940128-0-00007 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940128-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (d) of  1717.860 expands the circumstances under which a lien subordination may be obtained for investments
in rural development and other non-electric utility endeavors in the case of borrowers that meet the 110 percent test.
It provides that a borrower that meets the 110 percent test is eligible for a lien subordination on the specific assets
financed by a loan made directly to the borrower for rural development or other non-electric utility purposes, provided
that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated under paragraph (d), after taking into consideration
the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance
of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination.
While the rule grants this additional latitude to borrowers that meet the 110 percent test, REA continues to urge all
borrowers to use separate subsidiaries when making investments in rural development or other non-electric utility
endeavors. 

Investments lien subordinated under paragraph (d) will be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent
of total utility plant limitation set forth in 7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not
constitute approval of the investment under 7 CFR part 1717 subpart N. 

Paragraph (e) of  1717.860 exempts borrowers that meet the 110 percent test from the requirement of  1717.856(d)
that they submit an equity development plan with their application for a lien accommodation or subordination if the
ratio of their equity to total assets is below a specified level. 

Finally, paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(ii)(A) of  1717.852 are amended to make it clear that programs of
demand side management and energy conservation, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems are eligible
for lien accommodations and subordinations. 



Section 1717.904_Exemptions Pursuant to Section 306E of the RE Act



This new section establishes policies and procedures, consistent with those in  1710.7 and 1717.860, for lien
accommodations for supplemental concurrent loans made to borrowers that meet the 110 percent test.

For the reasons stated, 7 CFR chapter XVII, parts 1710 and 1717 are amended as follows: 



PART 1710_GENERAL AND PRE-LOAN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES COMMON TO INSURED AND GUARANTEED ELECTRIC LOANS 



1. The authority citation for part 1710 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 901-950b; Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of Agriculture, 7 CFR 2.23; Delegation of Authority
by the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development, 7 CFR 2.72, unless otherwise noted. 




2. Subpart A of part 1710 is amended by adding the following section to read as follows: 



 1710.7

Exemptions of REA operational controls under section 306E of the RE Act. 



(a) 

General policy. 

(1) Section 306E of the RE Act directs the Administrator to issue interim final regulations to minimize approval rights,
requirements, restrictions, and prohibitions imposed on the operations of electric borrowers whose net worth exceeds
110 percent of the outstanding loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA. The section also directs the Administrator,
when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by such borrowers, to offer, without
delay, to share the government's lien on the borrowers' systems or subordinate the government's lien on the property
financed by the private lender. 

(2) In issuing the regulations, the Administrator is authorized to establish requirements, guided by the practices
of private lenders with respect to similar credit risks, to ensure that the security, including the assurance of repayment,
for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. If the regulations are not issued within 180 days
of enactment of section 306E, the Administrator may not, until the regulations are issued, require prior approval
of, or establish any requirement, restriction, or prohibition, with respect to the operations of any electric borrower
that meets the 110 percent ratio. 

(3) Nothing in section 306E limits the authority of the Administrator to establish terms and conditions on the use
of funds from loans made or guaranteed by REA, to establish loan feasibility criteria and other requirements for the
approval of REA loans or loan guarantees, such as those set forth in this part, or to take any other action specifically
authorized by law. 

(4) This section addresses the application of section 306E of the RE Act to REA operational controls and other requirements
that apply in general to REA borrowers. The application of section 306E to lien accommodations and subordinations
is set forth in 7 CFR 1717.860 and 1717.904. 

(5) The exemptions granted by this section, 7 CFR 1717.860, and 7 CFR 1717.904 apply only to REA controls and approval
rights. They do not affect the controls and approval rights of other co-mortgagees under the REA mortgage. 

(b) 

Determination of ratio. 

The following principles and procedures will apply to the calculation of net worth as a ratio, expressed as a percent,
to the outstanding balance of all loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA, hereinafter called the borrower's
``net worth to REA debt ratio'', or simply ``the ratio'': 

(1) For purposes of determining whether a borrower is exempt from approvals, requirements, restrictions, or prohibitions
imposed by REA with respect to borrower operations, i.e., ``operational controls,'' the ratio normally will be based
on data as of December 31. Net worth will be based on the year-end financial and statistical reports submitted by borrowers
to REA, and outstanding loans made or guaranteed by REA will be based on REA's records. The financial and statistical
reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers) are subject to REA review and revision,
and they must comply with REA's system of accounts and accounting principles set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking
fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be
calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation; 

(2) Net worth will be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of REA Form 7 for distribution
borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of REA Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable
in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined
in 7 CFR part 1767; and 

(3) By no later than May 1 of each year, REA will notify each borrower in writing of its ratio as of December 31 of the preceding
year. If a borrower's net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent based on the year-end data, the borrower will be
exempt from the operational controls exempted under paragraph (c) of this section until subsequently notified in
writing by REA that it is no longer exempt.

(c) 

Borrower operations exempted from REA controls

. Borrowers who are notified by REA in writing that their net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent are exempted
from the operational controls of the REA mortgage and loan contract listed in this paragraph. These controls, which
are implemented through REA regulations and other documents, are as follows: 

(1) Requirement that extensions or additions to the borrower's electric utility system financed by the borrower's
own funds, as defined in 7 CFR 1717.652, be included in an REA-approved construction work plan. This exemption does
not apply to extensions or additions financed by loans made or guaranteed by REA or by loans for which REA has granted
a lien accommodation or subordination; 

(2) Requirements on contract bidding procedures, as set forth in  1710.120 and other REA regulations, except
when the construction is funded directly or through reimbursements from loans made or guaranteed by REA; 

(3) REA approval of construction contracts and engineering and architectural service contracts, and use of REA standard
forms of contracts, as set forth in  1710.120 and other REA regulations, except when the construction is funded
directly or through reimbursements from loans made or guaranteed by REA. To be eligible for exemption of REA approval
rights, here and elsewhere in this paragraph (c), the contracts must not contain any provisions that prohibit or restrict
the assignment of the contracts to the government upon the exercise by REA of its remedies under security instruments
securing loans made or guaranteed by REA. Throughout this section, REA approval of contracts also includes REA approval
of contract amendments and renewals; 

(4) REA approval of the borrower's use of general funds, as defined as ``own funds'' in 7 CFR 1717.652, for plant extensions
or additions or other investments in the borrower's electric utility system, provided that the funds will not be reimbursed
with funds from a loan made or guaranteed by REA, and: 

(i) The plant addition will not provide direct service to any ultimate consumer having an anticipated or contract
kilowatt-hour (kWh) or maximum kilowatt (kW) demand in any year that exceeds 25 percent of the borrower's total kWh
sales or maximum kW demand recorded during the previous calendar year; or 

(ii) If the investment is for the addition or substantial reconstruction of generation capacity, the borrower is
a power supply borrower and the addition or substantial reconstruction of capacity will not exceed 25 megawatts.
The exemption under this paragraph (ii) does not apply to distribution borrowers; 

(5) REA approval of contracts for the sale of electric power and energy to ultimate consumers except when the kWh sales
or maximum kW demand covered by the contract is for an amount in any year that exceeds 25 percent of the borrower's total
kWh sales or maximum kW demand during the previous calendar year; 

(6) REA approval of power purchase contracts with suppliers that do not receive financial assistance from REA, provided
that the contract is for a period of not more than 1 year and the kWh amount of energy or maximum kW capacity to be purchased
under the contract does not exceed 25 percent of the total kWh amount of energy purchased and/or generated by the borrower,
or maximum kW demand of the borrower, during the previous calendar year; 

(7) REA approval of transmission, interconnection, and power pooling contracts that cover a period of one year or
less; 

(8) REA approval of contracts for the operation and management and/or maintenance of a borrower's system, provided
that the contract does not cover all or substantially all of the borrower's system; 

(9) REA approval of the voluntary sale, lease or transfer by the borrower of any capital asset in exchange for fair market
value if: 

(i) The borrower is not in default under its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA. (As used
in this section, the term default includes defaults declared by the mortgagee as well as events that have occurred
and are continuing, which, with notice or lapse of time and notice, would become events of default.);

(ii) The proceeds of such sale, lease or transfer are applied as required by the REA mortgage; 

(iii) The value of the capital asset is less than 5 percent of net utility plant and the aggregate value of capital assets
sold, leased or transferred in any 12-month period is less than 10 percent of net utility plant; and 

(iv) If the borrower has an REA-approved wholesale power contract with a power supply borrower (seller), the circumstances
of the sale, lease or transfer of capital assets conform with the conditions in such contract under which the seller
may not withhold its consent to the sale, lease or transfer. The exemption of REA approval rights under this paragraph
(c)(9) applies only to voluntary sales, leases, and transfers, and does not affect REA's right under section 7 of the
RE Act to approve other dispositions of property by the borrower; 

(10) REA approval of the selection of a borrower's manager, provided that the borrower is not in default under its mortgage,
loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA. Nothing herein shall limit the right of REA under the mortgage
to request termination of the employment of a manager in the event of a default by the borrower; 

(11) REA approval, as set forth in the loan contract, of a borrower's selection of a bank in which funds of the borrower
are or will be deposited, provided that the borrower is not in default under its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or
any other agreement with REA. The requirement that such bank must be a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
is not exempted; 

(12) REA approval of the purchase of data processing equipment and system control equipment, except when funds for
the equipment, including reimbursements, derive from loans made or guaranteed by REA. This exemption, as well as
that set forth in paragraph (c)(13) of this section, also applies to all other borrowers, i.e., those that do not meet
the 110 percent equity ratio; and 

(13) Requirement that distribution borrowers notify REA in writing of proposed changes in electric rates 90 days
prior to the effective date of such rates. Instead, the required notification period shall be 30 days. 

(d) 

REA requirements and operational controls not exempted

. All requirements and operational controls contained in the REA mortgage and loan contract, or otherwise imposed
on borrowers pursuant to statute or regulation, that are not specifically listed in paragraph (c) of this section
are not exempted and shall continue to apply according to their terms. Examples of such requirements and controls
not exempted are listed in this paragraph for the convenience of the public. This list is not exhaustive, and the absence
of a requirement or control from this list in no way means that the requirement or control has been exempted: 

(1) Requirements and operational controls contained in the REA mortgage or loan contract that are necessary to ensure
that the security for loans made or guaranteed by REA is reasonably adequate and that the loans will be repaid, or to
accomplish other fundamental purposes of the RE Act. Some of these also represent terms and conditions with respect
to the use by borrowers of the proceeds of loans made or guaranteed by REA. Together, these controls include, but are
not limited to, the following: 

(i) Area coverage requirements set forth in the loan contract and in  1710.103; 

(ii) Requirement that certain borrowers maintain, on an ongoing basis, a power requirements study and a power requirements
study work plan, as set forth in  1710.201 and  1710.202;

Interest Earned Ratio and Debt Service Coverage ratio, as set forth in  1710.114;

(vi) Requirement that certain borrowers maintain an equity development plan, as set forth in  1710.116;

(vii) REA approval of retirements of capital credits in excess of amounts specifically authorized in the mortgage;

(viii) REA approval of borrower investments, loans, guarantees, and other obligations under 7 CFR Part 1717, subpart
N;

(ix) REA requirements on accounting, auditing, irregularities, financial reporting, and access to books and records;

(x) Requirement that borrowers record the mortgage and mortgage amendments;

(xi) Requirement that the mortgagor maintain and preserve the priority lien of the mortgage and defend title to the
mortgaged property;

(xii) Requirements on maintenance and repair of the mortgaged property;

(xiii) Requirements on insurance of the mortgaged property; and

(xiv) REA approval of borrower mergers and consolidations; and

(2) Requirements imposed on borrowers pursuant to statute or regulation and not specifically exempted by paragraph
(c) of this section. See, for example,   1710.122 through 1710.127.

(e) 

Rescission of exemptions if borrower defaults. 

If a borrower is in default with respect to any requirement of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement
with REA that has not been exempted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or other REA regulations, upon written
notice to the borrower REA may rescind all or any part of the exemptions granted pursuant to said regulations. The reinstated
requirements and controls will remain in effect until REA determines that they are no longer needed to help ensure
that the security, including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably
adequate.

(f) 

Reinstated controls. 

If REA controls are reinstated because the borrower defaults or its net worth falls below 110 percent of REA debt, such
controls and approval rights will apply to all applicable subsequent actions of the borrower, including without
limitation the amendment of contracts that the borrower entered into while eligible for an exemption under this section.

[Amended]



4. Section 1717.851 is amended by adding the following new definition: 




* * * * * 





Capital investment. 

For the purposes of  1717.860, capital investment means an original investment in an asset that is intended
for long-term continued use or possession and, for accounting purposes, is normally depreciated or depleted as it
is used. For example, such assets may include land, facilities, equipment, buildings, mineral deposits, patents,
trademarks, and franchises. Original investments do not include refinancings or refundings. 



* * * * * 




 1717.852



[Amended]


5. Section 1717.852 is amended in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) by removing the word ``and'' after ``coal
handling facilities,'' and by adding after the words ``for generation'' the following words: ``, programs of demand
side management and energy conservation, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems;''. 

6. Section 1717.852 is further amended by revising paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) to read as follows: 



 1717.852 


Financing purposes. 



* * * * * 



(b) * * * 

(1) * * * 

(ii) * * * 

(A) Renewable energy systems and REA-approved programs of demand side management and energy conservation; and 




* * * * *


7. New  1717.860 is added to read as follows: 



 1717.860 


Lien accommodations and subordinations under section 306E of the RE Act. 



(a) 

General. 

Under section 306E of the RE Act, when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by
a borrower whose net worth exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal balance of all loans made or guaranteed
to the borrower by REA, the Administrator will, without delay, offer to share the government's lien on the borrower's
system or subordinate the government's lien on the property financed by the private lender, provided that the security,
including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. To qualify
for a lien accommodation or subordination under this section, the investment must be an original capital investment,
i.e., not a refinancing or refunding. (See  1717.851 for the definition of capital investment.) 

(b) 

Determination of net worth to REA debt ratio. 

(1) In the case of applications for a lien accommodation, a borrower's net worth will be based on the borrower's most
recent financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old at the time the application
is received by REA, and the outstanding debt owed to or guaranteed by REA will be based on latest REA records available.
The financial and statistical reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers)
are subject to REA review and revision, and they must comply with REA's system of accounts and accounting principles
set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers
using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation.


(2) Net worth shall be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of REA Form 7 for distribution
borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of REA Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable
in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined
in 7 CFR part 1767. 

(c) 

Application requirements and process. 

(1) If a borrower's net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent, as determined by REA, and the borrower is in compliance
with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been
exempted in writing by REA, if requested REA will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination for
100 percent private financing of capital investments, provided that the security, including the assurance of repayment,
for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. REA's approval will be conditioned upon execution
and delivery by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to REA, if required, and such additional information,
documents, and opinions of counsel as REA may require. 

(2) The application must include the following: 

(i) A resolution of the borrower's board of directors requesting the lien accommodation and including the amount
and maturity of the proposed loan, a general description of the facilities or other purposes to be financed, the name
and address of the lender, and an attached term sheet summarizing the terms and conditions of the proposed loan; 

(ii) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that the borrower is in compliance with all requirements
of its mortgage, loan agreement with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been exempted in writing by
REA; 

(iii) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the
complete application is received by REA;

<TEXT>
 

(iv) Draft copy of any new mortgage or mortgage amendment (supplement) required by REA or the lender, unless REA has
notified the borrower that it wishes to prepare these documents itself; 

(v) A copy of the loan agreement, loan note, bond or other financing instrument, unless REA has notified the borrower
that these documents need not be submitted. These documents will not be subject to REA approval, but may be reviewed
to determine whether they contain any provisions that would result in the security, including assurance of repayment,
for loans made or guaranteed by REA no longer being reasonably adequate; 

(vi) The following certifications and reports required by law: 

(A) The certification by the project architect for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1717.850(i);


(B) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that flood hazard insurance will be obtained for the
full value of any buildings, or other facilities susceptible to damage if flooded, that will be located in a flood hazard
area; 

(C) Form AD-1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters_Primary
Covered Transactions, as required by 7 CFR part 3017; 

(D) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount
and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower
has been informed of the Government's collection options; and 

(E) The written acknowledgement from a registered engineer or architect regarding compliance with seismic provisions
of applicable model codes for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1792.104. All other elements of
an application listed in  1717.855,  1717.856, and  1717.858(c) not listed in this paragraph (c)
are exempted. 

(3) Applications from distribution borrowers are submitted to the general field representative (GFR), while applications
from power supply borrowers are submitted to the REA Power Supply Division, or its successor, in Washington, DC. When
an application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office. If Washington office
staff determine that an application is incomplete, the borrower will be promptly notified in writing about the deficiencies.
When the application is complete, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed
by REA will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien accommodation or subordination, the borrower and
the lender will be promptly notified in writing that the lien accommodation or subornation has been approved, subject
to the conditions cited in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 

(d) 

Rural development and other non-electric utility investments. 

Although REA recommends the use of separate subsidiaries as set forth in  1717.858, if requested by a borrower
that meets the 110 percent equity test and all other applicable requirements of this section, REA will provide a lien
subordination on the specific assets financed in the case of loans made directly to the borrower for rural development
and other non-electric utility purposes, provided that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated
under this paragraph (d), after taking into consideration the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of
the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by REA will
remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination. Investments lien subordinated under this paragraph
shall be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent of total utility plant limitation set forth in
7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not constitute approval of the investment under
7 CFR Part 1717, subpart N. 

(e) 

Equity development plans. 

Borrowers that qualify for a lien accommodation or lien subordination under this section are exempt from the requirement
set forth in  1717.856(d) that they submit an equity development plan as part of their application. This exemption
applies only to applications for a lien accommodation or subordination, and does not exempt borrowers from the requirements
of 7 CFR 1710.116 applicable to applications for a loan or loan guarantee from REA. 

(f) 

Requirements and controls not exempted. 

All requirements and limitations imposed with respect to lien accommodations and subordinations by this subpart
R that are not specifically exempted by this section are not exempted and shall continue to apply according to their
terms. 

8. New  1717.904 is added to read as follows: 



 1717.904 


Exemptions pursuant to section 306E of the RE Act. 



(a) 

General policy. 

If a borrower's net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent, as determined by REA, and the borrower is in compliance
with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been
exempted in writing by REA, REA will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation for a concurrent supplemental loan
if requested in writing by the borrower, provided that the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made
or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. REA's approval will be conditioned upon execution and delivery
by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to REA, if required, and such additional information, documents,
and opinions of counsel as REA may require.

(b) 

Determination of net worth to REA debt ratio. 

A borrower's ratio of net worth to REA debt will be determined as set forth in  1717.860(b). 

(c) 

Requirements and controls exempted. 

The applicable requirements and controls exempted by 7 CFR 1710.7(c) are also exempted with respect to concurrent
supplemental loans. 

(d) 

Requirements and controls not exempted. 

All requirements and controls applicable to concurrent supplemental financing set forth in this subpart and other
REA regulations that are not specifically exempted by 7 CFR 1710.7(c) are not exempted and shall continue to apply
according to their terms. These include, but are not limited to: 

(1) The applicable requirements listed in 7 CFR 1710.7(d); and 

(2) The requirements set forth in  1717.901(a) when a borrower requests early approval of a lien accommodation.


(e) 

Procedures.

Special Condition: Agusta Aerospace Corporation (Agusta) Model A109C Helicopter, Electronic Flight Instrument
System



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final special condition.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This special condition is issued for the Agusta Model A109C helicopter. This helicopter will have a novel or unusual
design feature associated with the Electronic Flight Instrument System. This special condition contains additional
safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that provided
by the applicable airworthiness standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On July 21, 1993, Agusta Aerospace Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, applied for a Supplemental Type Certificate
for installation of an Electronic Flight Instrument System in the Agusta Model A109C helicopter. This model is a 7
passenger, 2 engine, 5,997 pound normal category helicopter.



Type Certification Basis



The certification basis established for the Agusta Model A109C helicopter includes: Federal Aviation Regulation
(FAR)  21.29; part 27 effective February 1, 1965, Amendments 27-1 through 27-8; FAR part 29 dated
February 1, 1965, paragraph 29.903(b), for Category ``A'' engine isolation; and equivalent safety in lieu of compliance
shown for: FAR 27.1189 (regarding shut-off means); FAR 27.927(c) as amended by Amendment 27-12; and Airworthiness
Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight, eligible for day and night Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations,
with one or two pilots, when Agusta Kit No. 109-0810-22, Revision E or later approved revision, is incorporated,
and the helicopter is operated in accordance with the Model A109C Rotorcraft Flight Manual.

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for this helicopter because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed
under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with FAR  11.49 after public notice, as required
by   11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.101(b)(2)
for changes to the type certificates.



Novel or Unusual Design Feature



The Agusta Model A109C helicopter was identified as incorporating one or possibly more electrical, electronic,
or combination of electrical electronic (electrical/electronic) systems that will be performing functions critical
to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopter. The Electronic Flight Instrument System performs the
attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed to the pilot is critical to the continued
safe flight and landing of the helicopter for IFR operations in Instrument Meteorological Conditions.

If it is determined that these helicopters will incorporate other electrical/electronic systems performing critical
functions, those systems also will be required to comply with the requirements of this special condition.



Discussion of Comments



Notice of Proposed Special Condition No. SC-93-5-SW was published in the 


Federal Register

 on November 17, 1993, (58 FR 60569). No comments were received. Therefore, the special condition is adopted as proposed.




Conclusion



This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of helicopter. It is not a rule of general
applicability and affects only the applicant who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the affected
helicopter.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11
series airplanes, that requires replacing the anti-skid control unit. This amendment is prompted by three reports
of failure of the center landing gear drag link, after which the center landing gear swung aft and struck the fuselage.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the center landing gear drag link, which could result
in extensive damage to the fuselage structure. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38321). That action proposed to require replacing the anti-skid control unit. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposal. 

One commenter suggests that the proposed AD action is inappropriate for two reasons: 

1. Drag link failures occur only with the use of autobraking. Therefore, if only manual brakes are used, there should
be no requirement to modify the anti-skid control unit. 

2. Failure of the center landing gear drag link does not pose sufficient risk to the airframe to warrant AD action. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's suggestion that this AD action is not warranted. As for the commenter's
Item 1, the FAA points out that there has been at least one case of failure of the center gear with the application of manual
brakes prior to touchdown of the nose gear wheel. By replacing the Part Number (P/N) 6005304-1 control unit with
the P/N 6005304-2 unit (as required by this AD), center gear braking is inhibited both manually and through the
use of autobrakes until nose gear touchdown. 

As for the commenter's Item 2, the FAA notes that there have been at least three in-service failures of center landing
gear drag links that have caused significant structural damage to the airplane. In each occurrence, the failed drag
link allowed the center landing gear to swing aft and strike the fuselage. Additionally, there are numerous other
possible scenarios involving similar failures that could result in damage to the hydraulic and 
electrical systems of the airplane. The center landing gear is also needed to properly distribute the airplane's
weight for heavy weight landings. For these reasons, the FAA considers that failure of the center landing gear drag
link does present an unsafe condition sufficient to warrant mandated corrective action. The appropriate vehicle
for mandating such corrective action is the airworthiness directive. 

Two commenters request that the proposed compliance time of 9 months be 
extended to 12 months. The manufacturer has indicated that the fleet of affected Model MD-11's could not be retrofitted
within 9 months, given the current schedule of modifying the subject part on a rotatable basis and the capacity of the
manufacturer to modify the control units. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request. Extending the compliance
time an additional 3 months will not adversely affect safety and will allow the affected fleet 
to be modified in an orderly manner, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. Paragraph
(a) of the final rule has been revised to specify a compliance time of 12 months. 

One commenter requests that the wording of references to the anti-skid control unit be clarified. The preamble to
the notice referred to ``the anti-skid control unit for the center landing gear;'' however, this control unit controls
all of the landing gears, not just the center landing gear. The FAA agrees that clarification of this point is needed
and, where appropriate, has changed the wording in this final rule accordingly.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

There are approximately 86 McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 32 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators is 
estimated to be $1,760, or $55 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the
requirements of this AD. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small

entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Representative Payment 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Railroad Retirement Board. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) revises part 266 in order to provide more detailed guidelines regarding the
selection, payment, responsibilities, and monitoring of representative payees. The title of part 266 is also changed
from ``Incompetence'' to ``Representative Payment'' which better describes the contents of part 266. These revisions
are being made to improve the administration of the Board's representative payee program. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231 

et seq.

) provides a system of retirement and disability benefits for railroad employees, their spouses, children, and survivors
who meet certain eligibility requirements under that Act. Section 12 of the Act (45 U.S.C. 231k) contains the same
provisions as section 19 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the predecessor of the present Act, regarding the
competence of an annuitant and the Board's authority in cases where an annuitant is incompetent. Under these provisions,
any claimant or annuitant is presumed to be competent until the Board receives written notice to the contrary. If a
claimant or annuitant is incompetent, the Board may make payments to, or conduct transactions with, any legally appointed
guardian on behalf of the claimant or annuitant. Furthermore, section 12(a) expressly authorizes the Board to make
payments, or conduct transactions, directly with the claimant or annuitant, or with any other person on his or her
behalf, even though he or she is an incompetent for whom a guardian is acting. The provisions of section 12 are applicable
to benefits claimed or paid under any Act administered in whole or in part by the Board, including any claim for or payment
of social security benefits administered by the Board pursuant to section 7(b)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act
(45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(2)). 


There has been growing concern in the Congress to assure that surrogate decision making services, including representative-payee
services, are provided in a uniform, high quality manner which maximizes the potential of every individual for self-reliance
and independence. 
Since the Board is currently in the process of a comprehensive review, revision, and amendment of its regulations,
part 266 is revised at this time to address concerns that adequate safeguards be provided where payment of an annuity
under the Railroad Retirement Act is made to a representative payee rather than directly to the annuitant. Thus, the
revised part 266 expands, as well as revises, the present regulation. 

A brief summary of the disposition of the various section of the present part 266 under the proposed regulation is set
forth below. 


The present  266.1 simply sets forth the statutory provisions of section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA)
(45 U.S.C. 231k), and because of this redundancy, is removed. 
The present  266.2 has been incorporated into  266.1(b) of the revised regulation. The new  266.1
sets forth an introduction, consisting of an explanation of representative payment and the law and policy used to
determine whether to make representative payment. 
The present  266.3 has been incorporated into  266.3(a) of the revised regulation. The new  266.3
sets forth information which the Board will consider in determining whether to make representative payment. 
The present  266.4 has been redesignated as  266.12. New  266.4 sets forth what information the
Board will use in selecting a representative payee. 
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the present  266.5 have been redesignated as  266.2, and the term ``beneficiary''
has been removed and the term ``annuitant'' has been added in its place throughout the new part 266. New  266.5
describes the order of preference the Board will generally use in selecting representative payees. 
The present  266.6 has been incorporated into the new  266.9(a). The new  266.9 sets forth general
responsibilities of a representative payee. 
The present   266.7, 266.9, 266.10, and 266.11 have been revised and incorporated into a single section,
 266.10, which details how a representative payee is to use benefit payments. 

The present  266.8, ``Conservation and investment of benefit payments,'' has been revised and incorporated
into the new  266.11. 
Sections   266.6, 266.7, and 266.8 are new. Section 266.6 provides that a representative payee applicant
must provide the Board with the information listed in  266.4 and will generally be required to undergo a face-to-face
interview with a field representative of the Board. 
Section  266.7 provides that the representative payee make an accounting to the Board for the use of benefits
he or she 
receives as payee and sets forth what information will satisfy the requirement of an accounting. 
Section  266.8 provides that an annuitant may challenge the appointment or selection of a representative payee.
However, an individual who requests to be made a representative payee for an annuitant has no standing to challenge
the Board's refusal to make the appointment.

The present  266.12 has been revised and incorporated into the new  266.7(c) described above. Section
 266.12, as noted earlier, is the redesignated  266.4. 
The present  266.13 has been redesignated as the new  266.15. Sections   266.13 and 266.14
are new. The former section describes when the Board will terminate an individual's status as a representative payee
and appoint a new one. The latter section describes what evidence an annuitant must provide to the Board to terminate
representative payments and thereby receive benefits directly. 
The Board published this regulation as a proposed rule on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13225), requesting comments by April
9, 1993. A number of comments were received. 
One commenter suggested that a paragraph be added to  266.4 (Information considered in selecting a representative
payee) to provide that a creditor who provides goods and services to the annuitant should not be able to serve as a representative
payee unless such creditor is a relative, legal guardian, or connected with a licensed or certified care facility.
The Board agrees with this comment and a new paragraph (i) is added to  266.4 to reflect this proposal. 
One commenter suggested that  266.6 be modified to require a face-to-face interview with the payee-applicant
rather than a discretionary interview as was proposed in that section. In the Board's experience a mandatory interview
with the payee-applicant is not always necessary. In many cases the payee-applicant is a court appointed legal guardian
or conservator or is a licensed care facility. However, the Board will modify its internal procedures to provide that
where the payee-applicant is not interviewed, the Board employee responsible for developing the application for
representative payment shall document in writing why no interview was done. 
In the same vein, another commenter suggested that the regulation provide for a mandatory interview with the annuitant
when a payee is proposed and that the Board seek suggestions from the annuitant as to whom would make an appropriate
payee. As in the case of payee-applicant, the Board has found that a requirement to interview the annuitant in each
and every case where a representative-payee is required is not necessary. In many cases, the reason for the appointment
of a representative payee is that the annuitant is no longer sentient or capable of significant communication. Of
course, in these cases a requirement for an interview would serve no purpose. Rather than adopt a mandatory requirement
for an interview with the annuitant, the Board is of the opinion that the better approach is the one referred to above
with respect to the payee-applicant interview; namely, that the annuitant will be interviewed and his or her recommendations
sought whenever possible. Where the annuitant is not interviewed, the Board employee responsible for developing
the application for representative-payee must document the basis for not conducting the interview. The Board's
internal operating procedures will be modified to reflect this change. 
A comment was also received with respect to   266.7 (b) and (c). Under these sections where the representative
payee fails to provide the Board with an accounting of his or her expenditures or fails to provide other information,
the Board may suspend payment to the payee and then the payments are held in trust by the Board until a new representative
payee is found or payments are reinstated to the present payee. One commenter was concerned that the regulation did
not provide that if a new representative payee is not found, or payment to the present representative payee reinstated,
within 30 days, that payments were not required to be made to the annuitant. The commenter pointed out that such a provision
is provided for in the Social Security Act with respect to its representative payee program. See 42 U.S.C. 204(j)(2)(D).
In the Board's experience the vast majority of annuitants for whom representative payees are appointed are not competent
to handle their finances. When payment to a representative payee is suspended pending appointment of a new payee,
the Board seeks to appoint a new payee with the utmost speed. However, this process may take longer than 30 days because,
as the commenter pointed out, there is indeed a shortage of individuals willing to act as representative payees. On
the other hand, making payments to an individual who cannot manage his or her own affairs would not be in the best interest
of the annuitant. Consequently, the Board has modified  266.7 by adding a new paragraph (d) which provides that
where payment to a representative payee is suspended to appoint a new representative payee, such payment must be reinstated
within 30 days unless the annuitant is an unemancipated minor under age 18, or is judged by the Board to be incapable
of handling his benefit payments, in which case the Board will hold the payments in trust until a new representative
payee is appointed.

Finally, one commenter suggested that the Board seek legislative authority to impose administrative penalties
on representative payees who misuse funds. The Board agrees that this suggestion has merit and will take it under advisement.


The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866; therefore,
no regulatory impact analysis is required. Information collection has been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under control numbers 3220-0151 and 3220-0052.

PART 266_REPRESENTATIVE PAYMENT 



 266.1 

Introduction. 



(a) 

Explanation of representative payment.

 This part explains the principles and procedures that the Board follows in determining whether to make representative
payment and in selecting a representative payee. It also explains the responsibilities that a representative payee
has concerning the use of the funds which he or she receives on behalf of an annuitant. A representative payee may be
either a person or an organization selected by the Board to receive benefits on behalf of an annuitant. A representative
payee will be selected if the Board believes that the interest of an annuitant will be served by representative payment
rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, the Board will appoint a representative payee if it determines
that the annuitant is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest. 

(b) 

Statutory authority.

 Section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act provides that every annuitant and claimant shall be conclusively presumed
to have been competent until the date on which the Board receives a notice in writing that a legal guardian or other person
legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor has been appointed: Provided, however,
That despite receiving such notice, the Board may, if it finds the interests of such annuitant or claimant to be served
thereby, recognize actions by, conduct transactions with, and make payments to such annuitant or claimant.

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.

 (1) In accordance with section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board's policy is that every annuitant has the
right to manage his or her own benefits. However, some annuitants due to mental or physical condition or due to their
youth may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of an annuitant would be better served if benefit
payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the annuitant
is a legally competent individual. If the annuitant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the
legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.

(2) If payment is being made directly to an annuitant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or
direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the annuitant is 18 years old or older and has not been adjudged
legally incompetent, continue to pay the annuitant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability
to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.



 266.2

 Recognition by the Board of a person to act in behalf of another.



(a) Regardless of the receipt of written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with
the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor who is receiving or claiming benefits or to whom any right
or privilege is extended under the law, the Board may, in its discretion, validly recognize actions by and conduct
transactions with others acting on behalf of the individual found by the Board to be a minor or to be unable to manage
his or her affairs, if the Board finds such actions or transactions to be in the best interest of such individual.

(b) In the absence of a written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of
the person or estate of an incompetent or minor, the Board shall, except where special circumstances appear, recognize
a person to act on behalf of an individual under the following circumstances:

(1) When the individual has been adjudged mentally incompetent by a court having jurisdiction to do so;

(2) When the individual has been committed to a mental institution by a court having jurisdiction to do so;

(3) When the individual is an inmate of a mental institution;

(4) When the individual is less than 16 years of age; or

(5) When the individual is between 16 and 18 years of age and is in the care of another person and does not have the capacity
to act on his or her own behalf.



 266.3

 Information considered in determining whether to make representative payments.



In determining whether to make representative payment, the Board may consider the following information:

(a) 

Evidence of legal guardianship.

 Evidence of the appointment of a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate
of an incompetent or a minor shall be a certified copy of the court's determination.

<PARENT> FR940128-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Medical evidence.

 The Board may use medical evidence, when such is available, to help determine whether an annuitant is capable of managing
or directing the management of benefit payments. For example, a statement by a physician or other medical professional
based upon his or her recent examination of the annuitant and his or her knowledge of the annuitant's present condition
will be used in the Board's determination, if it includes information concerning the nature of the annuitant's illness,
the annuitant's chances for recovery and the opinion of the physician or other medical professional as to whether
the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.

(c) 

Other evidence.

 The Board may also consider statements of relatives, friends, and other people in a position to know and observe the
annuitant, which contain information helpful to the Board in deciding whether the annuitant is able to manage or direct
the management of benefit payments.



 266.4

 Information considered in selecting a representative payee.



In selecting a representative payee, the Board tries to select the person, agency, organization or institution that
will best serve the interest of the annuitant. In making this selection, the Board may consider such factors as the
following:

(a) The relationship of the person to the annuitant, including the type of relationship, 

e.g.,

 family or legal guardianship; degree of relationship, if the person is a family member; and the length of association,
if a non-family member;

(b) The amount of interest that the person shows in the annuitant, including the contributions the person makes to
the welfare of the annuitant and the contacts and frequency of such contacts with the annuitant;

(c) Any legal authority the person, agency, organization or institution has to act on behalf of the annuitant;

(d) Whether the potential payee has custody of the annuitant;

(e) Whether the potential payee is in a position to know of and look after the needs of the annuitant;

(f) Verification of the social security account number, name, address, telephone number, place of employment, and
main source of income if applicable, accepted as part of any person's application for designation as a representative
payee, unless such person's identification has already been established to the satisfaction of the Board;

(g) Whether an applicant for designation as a representative payee has ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor
under the statutes administered by the Board or the Social Security Act, or convicted of a felony under any other Federal
or State law; and

(h) Whether the services of such person as representative payee have previously been terminated, suspended, or declined
by the Board or the Social Security Administration for:

(1) Misuse of the benefits of the annuitant for whom they were intended;

(2) Failure to comply with any provision of or regulation under the Railroad Retirement Act or the Social Security
Act; or

(3) Failure to meet the requirements of this part.

(i) Whether the potential payee is a creditor of the annuitant. A creditor who provides goods and services to the annuitant
ordinarily may not serve as a representative payee unless such appointment poses no substantial conflict of interest
and unless the creditor is:

(1) A relative who resides with the annuitant;

(2) A legal guardian or legal representative of the annuitant; or

(3) A licensed or certified care facility (or owner, administrator or employee thereof) where there annuitant resides.



 266.5

 Order of preference in selecting a representative payee.



As a guide in selecting a representative payee, categories of preferred payees have been established. These preferences
are flexible. The primary concern of the Board is to select the payee who will best serve the annuitant's interest.
The preferences are:

(a) For annuitants 18 years old or older, the preference is:

(1) A legal guardian, spouse, or other relative who has custody of the annuitant or who demonstrates strong concern
for the personal welfare of the annuitant;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940128-0-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940128-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) A friend who has custody of the annuitant or demonstrates strong concern for the personal welfare of the annuitant;


(3) A public or nonprofit agency or institution having custody of the annuitant; 

(4) A private institution operated for profit and licensed under State law, which has custody of the annuitant; and


(5) Persons other than those listed above who are qualified to carry out the responsibilities of a representative
payee and who are able and willing to serve as a payee for an annuitant; 

e.g.,

 members of community groups or organizations who volunteer to serve as representative payee for an annuitant. 

(b) For annuitants under age 18, the preference is: 

(1) A natural or adoptive parent who has custody of the annuitant, or a legal guardian; 

(2) A natural or adoptive parent who does not have custody of the annuitant, but is contributing toward the annuitant's
support and is demonstrating strong concern for the annuitant's well-being; 

(3) A relative or stepparent who has custody of the annuitant; 

(4) A natural or adoptive parent who does not have custody of the annuitant and is not contributing toward his or her
support but is demonstrating strong concern for the annuitant's well-being; 

(5) A relative who does not have custody of the annuitant but is contributing toward the annuitant's support and is
demonstrating concern for the annuitant's well-being; 

(6) A relative or close friend who does not have custody of the annuitant but is demonstrating concern for the annuitant's
well-being; and 

(7) An authorized social agency or custodial institution. 



 266.6 

Information to be submitted by a representative 
payee-applicant; face-to-face interview. 



Before the Board selects a representative payee, the Board may request the payee-applicant to provide information
concerning the factors listed in  266.4 of this part. An employee of the Board may also conduct a face-to-face
interview with the payee-applicant.




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0052.) 



 266.7 

Accountability of a representative payee. 



(a) A representative payee is accountable for the use of benefits. The Board will require periodic written reports
from representative payees. The Board may also, at the Board's option, verify how a representative payee used benefit
payments. A representative payee must keep records of what was done with all benefit payments in order to make accounting
reports. The Board may ask the following questions: 

(1) The amount of benefit payments on hand at the beginning of the accounting period; 

(2) How the benefit payments were used; 

(3) How much of the benefit payments were saved and how the savings were invested; 

(4) Where the annuitant lived during the accounting period; 

(5) The amount of the annuitant's income from other sources during the accounting period. The Board may ask for information
about other funds to enable the Board to evaluate the use of benefit payments; and 

(6) Whether the representative payee has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor offense under the statutes administered
by the Board or by the Social Security Administration within the past 15 years or whether any such charges are pending.


(b) An individual to whom payments are certified as representative payee on behalf of an annuitant shall submit a written
report in such form and at such times as the Board may require, accounting for the payments certified to him or her on
behalf of the annuitant. If, however, such payee is a court-appointed fiduciary and, as such, is required to make an
annual accounting to the court, a true copy of each such account filed with the court may be submitted in lieu of the accounting
form prescribed by the Board. If any representative payee fails to submit the required accounting within a reasonable
period of time after it is requested, no further payments shall be made to him or her on behalf of the annuitant unless
for good cause shown, the default of the representative payee is excused by the Board, and the required accounting
is thereafter submitted. 

(c) At any time after the Board has selected a representative payee, the Board may ask such payee to submit information
showing a continuing relationship to the annuitant and a continuing responsibility for the care of the annuitant.
If the representative payee does not give the Board the requested information within a reasonable period of time,
the Board may stop paying such payee unless the Board determines that the payee had a good reason for not complying with
the Board's request, and the Board receives the information requested.




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 3220-0052 and 3220-0151.)




(d) Where, pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, the Board suspends payments, such suspension shall not
exceed a period of 30 days; thereafter, the payments will be made to the annuitant except where the annuitant is an unemancipated
minor under age 18 or where in the Board's judgment the interests of the annuitant would not be served by releasing payment
to the annuitant.

(a) As a general rule, whenever the Board intends to make representative payment and to name a representative payee,
the Board will notify the annuitant or, in the case of an unemancipated minor under age 18, or an individual who is legally
incompetent, the individual acting on his or her behalf of the Board's proposed actions. Such notice will tell the
person that the Board plans to name a representative payee and who that payee will be. The notice will also ask the person
to contact the Board within 15 days of the date of the notice if he or she objects to either proposed action. If he or she
objects to either proposed action, the objecting party may_

(1) Review the evidence upon which the proposed actions will be based; and 

(2) Submit any additional evidence regarding the proposed actions. 

(b) If the objecting party objects to the proposed actions, the Board will review its proposed determinations and
consider any additional information provided. The Board will then issue a decision on whether to appoint a representative
payee and who that payee will be. If the objecting party is dissatisfied with either determination, he or she may request
a reconsideration under part 260 of this chapter. 

(c) If the objecting party does not file a timely objection to the proposed actions, the Board will issue a decision
on whether to appoint a representative payee and who that payee will be. If the objecting party is dissatisfied with
either determination, he or she may request a reconsideration under part 260 of this chapter. 

(d) A request for reconsideration or an appeal from a determination under this section under part 260 of this chapter
shall not prevent the Board from making payments to a representative payee during the pendency of such reconsideration
or appeal. 

(e) The Board's failure or refusal to select an individual as representative payee or the Board's termination of representative
payee status with respect to an individual is not subject to a request for reconsideration or an appeal under part 260
of this chapter by such individual. 



 266.9 

Responsibilities of a representative payee. 



(a) A representative payee shall, subject to review by the Board and to such requirements as it may from time-to-time
prescribe, apply the payments made to him or her on behalf of the annuitant only for the use and benefit of such annuitant,
and in a manner and for purposes which are in the annuitant's best interests. 

(b) A representative payee shall notify the Board of any event that will affect the amount of benefits the annuitant
receives or the right of the annuitant to receive benefits. 

(c) A representative payee shall notify the Board of any change in his or her circumstances that would affect performance
of the payee responsibilities. 



 266.10 

Use of benefit payments. 



(a) 

Current maintenance.

 Payments made to an individual as representative payee on behalf of an annuitant shall be considered as having been
applied for the use and benefit of the annuitant when they are used for the annuitant's current maintenance. Current
maintenance includes costs incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items.






Example:

 An aged annuitant is entitled to a monthly railroad retirement benefit of $800. His son, who is his representative
payee, disburses his benefits in the following manner:




Rent and utilities 
 $500 

Medical 
 50 

Food 
 80 

Clothing (coat) 
 90 

Savings 
 60 

Miscellaneous 
 20 




The above expenditures would represent proper disbursements on behalf of the annuitant. 




(b) 

Institutional care.

 If an annuitant is receiving care in a Federal, state, or private institution because of mental or physical incapacity,
current maintenance includes the customary charges made by the institution in providing care and maintenance, as
well as expenditures for those items which will aid in the annuitant's recovery or release from the institution or
expenses for personal needs which will improve the annuitant's conditions while in the institution. 

(c) 

Support of legal dependents.

 If the current maintenance needs of the annuitant are met, the representative payee may use part of the payments for
the support of the annuitant's legally dependent spouse, child, and/or parent.

<PARENT> FR940128-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) 

Claims of creditors. 

Where a debt arose prior to the first month for which benefits are certified to a representative payee, the representative
payee may satisfy such debt out of present benefit payments only if the current and reasonably foreseeable needs of
the annuitant are met. 





Example: 

A retroactive railroad retirement annuity check in the amount of $2,100, representing benefits due for November
1989 through January 1990, was issued on behalf of the annuitant to the annuitant's daughter, who is the representative
payee. The check was certified in February 1990. The nursing home, where the annuitant resides, is owed money for maintenance
expenses the annuitant incurred prior to February 1990. 



If the accrual is not required for the annuitant's current maintenance and the annuitant had no foreseeable needs
which would require large disbursements, the expenditure of the accrual or part thereof for the past due maintenance
charges would be consistent with the Board's guidelines. 


 266.11

Conservation and investment of benefit payments. 


(a) 

General. 

If benefit payments made to a representative payee are not needed for the annuitant's current maintenance or reasonably
foreseeable needs or the support of legal dependents or to pay creditors in accordance with  266.10, they shall
be conserved or invested on behalf of the annuitant. Such funds must be invested in accordance with the rules applicable
to investment of trust estates by trustees. Any investment must show clearly that the representative payee holds
the property in trust for the annuitant. 
(b) 

Preferred investments. 

Preferred investments for excess funds are deposits in an interest or dividend paying account in a bank, trust company,
credit union, or savings and loan association which is insured under either Federal or State law, direct obligations
of the United States Government or obligations for which both principal and interest are guaranteed unconditionally
by the United States Government. The account must be in a form which shows clearly that the representative payee has
only a fiduciary, and not a personal, interest in the funds. If the payee is the legally appointed guardian or fiduciary
of the annuitant, the account may be established to indicate this relationship. If the payee is not the legally appointed
guardian or fiduciary, the accounts may be established as follows: 
(1) For U.S. Savings Bonds_






(Name of annuitant) 






(Social Security Number), for whom

 




(Name of payee)

 

is representative payee for Railroad Retirement benefits; 



(2) For interest or dividend paying accounts_






(Name of annuitant) by



 


(Name of payee), representative payee. 



(c) 

Interest and dividend payments. 

The interest and dividends which result from an investment are the property of the annuitant and may not be considered
to be the property of the representative payee. 
(d) 

Prohibition against commingling. 

The representative payee shall not commingle his or her personal funds with the representative payments. A representative
payee may consolidate and maintain an annuitant's funds in an account with other annuitants if he or she maintains
a separate, accurate and complete accounting of each annuitant's funds under his or her control. 


 266.12

Effect of matters or actions submitted or taken by legal guardian, etc. 


All matters and actions in connection with an annuity submitted or taken by the guardian or other person legally vested
with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor shall be considered by the Board in the same manner and
with the same effect as though such matters or actions had been submitted or taken by the ward, if the ward had capacity
to act in his or her own behalf; 

Provided, however,

 That the Board may, if it deems it necessary, require the guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the
person or estate of an incompetent or a minor to submit a certified copy of an order from the court of appointment authorizing
some particular action which the guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate desires
to take in connection with the application. 


 266.13

When a new representative payee will be selected. 


When the Board learns that the interests of the annuitant are not served by continuing payment to the present representative
payee or that the present representative payee is no longer able to carry out the payee responsibilities, the Board
will undertake to find a new representative payee. The Board will select a new representative payee if the Board finds
a preferred payee or if the present payee_
(a) Has not used the benefit payments on the annuitant's behalf in accordance with the guidelines in this part;

(b) Has not carried out the other responsibilities described in this part; 
(c) Dies; 
(d) No longer wishes to be representative payee; 
(e) Is unable to manage the benefit payments; or 
(f) Fails to cooperate, within a reasonable time, in providing evidence, accounting, or other information which
the Board requests. 


 266.14

When representative payment will be stopped. 


If an annuitant receiving representative payment shows the Board that he or she is mentally and physically able to
manage or direct the management of benefit payments, the Board will make direct payment to the annuitant. Information
which the annuitant may give to the Board to support his or her request for direct payment include the following: 
(a) A physician's statement regarding the annuitant's condition, or a statement by a medical officer of the institution
where the annuitant is or was confined, showing that the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of his
or her funds; 
(b) A certified copy of a court order restoring the annuitant's rights in a case where an annuitant was adjudged legally
incompetent; or 
(c) Other evidence which establishes the annuitant's ability to manage or direct the management of benefits. 


 266.15

Transfer of accumulated benefit payments. 


A representative payee who has conserved or invested funds from railroad retirement payments made to him or her on
behalf of an annuitant shall, upon direction of the Board, transfer any such funds (including interest or dividends
earned from investment of such funds) to a successor representative payee appointed by the Board, or, at the option
of the Board, shall transfer such funds, including interest, to the Board for payment to a successor payee or to the
annuitant.

Duration of Normal and Extended Benefits 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Railroad Retirement Board. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) hereby revises its regulations under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance
Act (RUIA) to update the provisions concerning the duration of normal unemployment and sickness benefits under the
RUIA and to add provisions concerning the establishment of extended benefit periods under the RUIA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This revision to part 336 revises the part heading from ``Exhaustion of Rights to Benefits'' to ``Duration of Normal
and Extended Benefits'', and consists of two subparts. Subpart A explains how long a qualified railroad employee
may receive normal unemployment and sickness benefits. Subpart B explains under what circumstances an employee
with 10 or more years of railroad service may receive extended unemployment or sickness benefits and the duration
of an employee's extended benefit period. This rule also removes existing  336.3, which relates to payment
of extended unemployment benefits under the Temporary Extended Railroad Unemployment Insurance Benefits Act of
1961. Extended benefits are no longer payable under that Act. As revised,  336.3 explains the duration of normal
sickness benefits under the RUIA. 



On August 17, 1993, the Board published this rule as a proposed rule (58 FR 43577), inviting comments on or before September
16, 1993. No comments were received. 

The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order No. 12866;
therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. The information collection requirements contained in this
rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0070.

Subpart A_Normal Benefits 



 336.1 

Introduction. 



(a) 

General.

 This subpart explains how long a qualified employee may receive normal unemployment or sickness benefits under the
Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act during a benefit year. Under section 2(c) of that Act, normal unemployment benefits
are payable for up to 130 days of unemployment within a benefit year, or in an amount equal to the amount of the employee's
``base year compensation'', whichever is less. A similar limitation applies to the payment of sickness benefits.
An employee who exhausts his or her normal unemployment or sickness benefits may be eligible for payment of extended
unemployment or extended sickness benefits under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part. 

(b) 

Definitions.

 The terms ``benefit year'', ``base year'', and ``compensation'' are defined in part 302 of this chapter. The term
``registration period'' is defined in parts 325 and 335 of this chapter. For the purposes of this subpart, and as explained
in  336.4 of this part, an employee's ``base year compensation'' may include compensation in excess of the monthly
compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) even though such excess may not be counted for the purpose
of determining whether such employee is a ``qualified employee'' within the meaning of part 302. 

(c) 

Recovery of benefits.

 When unemployment or sickness benefits are recovered by the Board for one or more days, the Board will disregard those
days in determining whether the employee has exhausted normal unemployment or sickness benefits with respect to
the applicable benefit year. 



 336.2 Duration of normal unemployment benefits. 



(a) 

130 compensable day limitation.

 A qualified employee who has satisfied the waiting period for a benefit year may receive benefits for a maximum of 130
days of unemployment within such benefit year, subject to the limitation on payment explained in paragraph (b) of
this section. In any registration period beginning after the end of the waiting period and before the beginning of
the next ensuing benefit year, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of four, but the aggregate number
of compensable days may not exceed 130 for the benefit year. An employee who is unemployed on all days during a registration
period could have a maximum of 10 compensable days of unemployment in such registration period. The amount of benefits
for each compensable day of unemployment is the amount of the daily benefit rate computed for such employee pursuant
to part 330 of this chapter.

<PARENT> FR940128-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Base year compensation limit.

 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will not pay unemployment benefits to
a qualified employee, with respect to his or her days of unemployment within a benefit year, in an amount greater than
the amount of his or her base year compensation, as computed under  336.4 of this part. 

(c) 

Unemployment due to a strike.

 The limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to an employee whose unemployment is
due to a stoppage of work because of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which he was last employed.
But no unemployment benefits are payable for the employee's first 14 days of unemployment due to such stoppage of work.




 336.3 

Duration of normal sickness benefits. 



The duration of normal sickness benefits is the same as the duration of normal unemployment benefits, as set forth
in 
 336.2 of this part. A qualified employee who has satisfied the benefit year waiting period and is otherwise
eligible for sickness benefits may receive benefits for a maximum of 130 days of sickness within a benefit year, but
the amount paid as sickness benefits may not exceed the amount of the employee's base year compensation, as computed
under  336.4 of this part. 



 336.4 

Base year compensation. 



(a) 

Formula.

 For the purposes of this part, an employee's base year compensation includes any compensation in excess of the monthly
compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) for any month in the applicable base year but shall not include
any amount that exceeds the value of ``X'' in the following formula: X = $775(A/$600). In this formula, ``A'' is the
dollar amount of the monthly compensation base with respect to months in such base year. For example, if an employee
had railroad earnings of $1,500 per month in each of three months in base year 1990, the employee's base year compensation
for purposes of part 302 of this chapter would be $2,235 (three times the monthly compensation base of $745 per month
for months in 1990). But the employee's base year compensation for purposes of computing maximum normal unemployment
(or sickness) benefits under this subpart would be $2,886 (three times $962), and his or her normal unemployment (or
sickness) benefits would not be considered exhausted until he or she is paid unemployment (or sickness) benefits
in an amount equal to $2,886. In this example, $962 is the amount computed as the value of ``X'' in the above formula when
``A'' is equal to $745. 

(b) 

Employer's duty to report.

 The base year employer(s) of an employee shall provide information as to the amount of an employee's monthly compensation
in excess of the monthly compensation base, as defined in part 302 of this chapter, unless the amount of the employee's
compensation at the monthly compensation base limit, as already reported to the Board, is equal to or greater than
an amount equal to 130 times the daily benefit rate applicable to the employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness.






(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0070.) 



 336.5 

Notice to employee. 



The Board will notify an employee when it appears that his or her right to normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits
will be exhausted. Such notice will include information about the availability of extended benefits under subpart
B of this part if the employee has completed 10 years of railroad service and the availability of normal benefits for
the next ensuing benefit year if the employee is not eligible for extended benefits. 



Subpart B_Extended Benefits 



 336.10 

Eligibility. 



(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee may receive extended unemployment or extended
sickness benefits under this part if he or she: 

(1) Has exhausted normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits (as the case may be) under subpart A of this part;


(2) Has completed 10 years of railroad service, as set forth in  336.13 of this part; and 

(3) Continues to have days of unemployment or days of sickness, as the case may be. 

(b) An employee is not eligible for extended sickness benefits if he or she has voluntarily retired or has attained
age 65. In the case of claims for unemployment benefits, an employee is not eligible for extended unemployment benefits
if he or she has voluntarily left work without good cause or has voluntarily retired. 



 336.11 

Exhaustion of rights to normal unemployment benefits. 



For the purposes of this part, the Board considers that an employee has exhausted his or her current rights to normal
benefits for days of unemployment if: 

(a) The employee received unemployment benefits for 130 days of unemployment in the benefit year; or 

(b) The employee received unemployment benefits in the benefit year equal to the amount of his or her base year compensation;
or 

(c) At the end of a normal benefit year during which the employee was qualified for benefits, he or she received less
than the maximum unemployment benefits for the benefit year and he or she is not qualified for benefits in the next succeeding
benefit year. 



 336.12 

Exhaustion of rights to normal sickness benefits. 



For the purposes of this part, the Board considers that an employee has exhausted his or her current rights to normal
benefits for days of sickness if: 

(a) The employee received sickness benefits for 130 days of sickness in the benefit year; or 

(b) The employee received sickness benefits in the benefit year equal to the amount of his or her base year compensation;
or

(c) At the end of the normal benefit year during which the employee was qualified for benefits, he or she received less
than the maximum sickness benefits for the benefit year and he or she is not qualified for benefits in the next succeeding
benefit year. 


 336.13 

Years of service requirement. 


(a) 

Statutory basis

. For the purposes of this part, an employee is not eligible for extended unemployment or sickness benefits if he or
she does not have at least 10 years of railroad service. An employee who has 120 service months as defined in part 210
of this chapter, whether or not consecutive, is considered to have 10 years of railroad service, and an employee who
has 180 service months, whether or not consecutive, is considered to have 15 years of railroad service.
 
(b) 

Initial determination

. The Board will determine whether an employee has 10 years, or 15 years, of railroad service on the basis of reports
filed by employers pursuant to part 209 of this chapter. The number of years of service shown in the Board's records
will be accepted as correct for the purposes of this part, unless the employee claims credit for more service than that
shown in the Board's records and such 
additional service is verified. In any such case, the Board will afford the employee an opportunity to establish credit
for additional service if such service would be sufficient to bring the employee up to 10 years, or 15 years, of service.
If the claim for credit for additional service is made by an employee who has at least 10 years of railroad service but
is claiming credit for at least 15 years, the Board will not delay the establishment of an extended benefit period based
on 10 years of service but shall extend the ending date of such period if the employee is able to establish credit for
15 years of railroad service. 
(c) 

Effective date

. An employee acquires 10 years, or 15 years, of railroad service, as the case may be, as of the first day with respect
to which creditable compensation is attributable in his 120th, or 180th, month of service. 


 336.14 

Extended benefit period. 


(a) 

Defined

. An extended benefit period consists of seven consecutive 14-day registration periods in the case of an employee
having 10-14 years of railroad service and 13 consecutive 14-day registration periods in the case of an employee
having 15 or more years of railroad service.
 
(b) 

Beginning date

. In the case of unemployment benefits, an extended benefit period begins with the first day of unemployment after
the day on which the employee exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment benefits. In the case of sickness benefits,
the beginning date is the first day of sickness after the employee exhausts normal sickness benefits. Such first day
of unemployment or first day of sickness must be within the same benefit year with respect to which the employee exhausted
normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits, as the case may be. However, no extended benefit period may begin
on any day of unemployment or sickness prior to the date on which the employee acquired 10 years of railroad service.

(c) 

Ending date

. If an employee has 10 but less than 15 years of railroad service, his or her extended benefit period ends on the 97th
day after it began. If an employee has 15 or more years of railroad service, his or her extended benefit period ends on
the 181st day after it began. If an employee attains age 65 during an extended sickness benefit period, such extended
benefit period will terminate on the day next preceding the date on which the employee attains age 65, except that it
may continue for the purpose of paying benefits for his or her days of unemployment, if any, during such extended benefit
period. If an extended sickness benefit period terminates because the employee has attained age 65 and if at that point
the employee has rights to normal sickness benefits, the employee will be paid normal sickness benefits if he or she
is otherwise entitled to payment thereof. 
(d) 

Maximum number of compensable days

. During an extended benefit period consisting of seven consecutive 14-day registration periods, extended benefits
may be paid for a maximum of 65 days of unemployment (or 65 days of sickness, as the case may be). During an extended benefit
period consisting of 13 consecutive 14-day registration periods, extended benefits may be paid for a maximum of 130
days of unemployment (or 130 days of sickness, as the case may be). 


 336.15 

How to claim extended benefits. 


An employee who has 10 or more years of railroad service who exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment or normal
sickness benefits and who wishes to claim extended unemployment or extended sickness benefits may do so by claiming
benefits on the forms provided by the Board pursuant to parts 325 or 335 of this chapter. The claim forms provided for
this purpose are the same as those provided for claiming normal benefits. No special application for extended benefits
is required, and no waiting period applies to the payment of extended benefits. 


 336.16 

Notice to employee. 


Upon determining that an employee is eligible for a period of extended unemployment or sickness benefits, the Board
will notify the employee of the beginning and ending dates of such extended benefit period.

 of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17553), the agency proposed to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC)
drug products to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in the labeling required by an OTC drug monograph.
The agency had previously proposed in a number of tentative final monographs and included in a number of final monographs
a provision that the words ``doctor'' and ``physician'' may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products.
(See, e.g.,   333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e) (21 CFR 333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e)).)
Instead of including this provision in each OTC drug monograph, the agency proposed to include such a provision in
 330.1 (21 CFR 330.1) as part of the general conditions under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe,
effective, and not misbranded. The agency also proposed that, at manufacturers' discretion, the word ``ask'' could
be substituted for the word ``consult,'' which appears in the directions for many OTC drug monograph ingredients.
(See, e.g.,   333.150(c)(1), 333.350(c)(2), and 340.50(c)(2) (21 CFR 340.50(c)(2)).) Thus, the agency
proposed that the phrases ``consult a physician,'' ``consult a doctor,'' ``ask a physician,'' and ``ask a doctor''
could be used interchangeably. The agency invited comments and suggestions as to such other terms that could be used
interchangeably, i.e., terms general in nature that appear in more than one OTC drug monograph.


One trade association, representing OTC drug manufacturers, and one drug manufacturer submitted comments in response
to the agency's proposal. Copies of the comments are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, and may be seen by interested
persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


I. Summary of the Comments Received


The comment from the trade association agreed with the agency's proposal to allow for the interchangeable use of the
words ``doctor'' and ``physician,'' and the words ``consult'' and ``ask.'' The comment suggested the following
additional sets of alternative terms and gave the following citations, showing inclusion in several OTC drug monographs,
as support: (1) ``Clean'' or ``cleanse'' (  333.150(d), 333.350(d)(1), and 346.50(d)(1) (21 CFR 346.50(d)(1)));
(2) ``persist'' or ``continue'' (  341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i)
(21 CFR 341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i))); (3) ``chronic'' or ``persistent''
(  336.50(c)(1), 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1)
(21 CFR 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1))); (4) ``assistance''
or ``help'' (  331.30(g), 332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii) (21 CFR 331.30(g),
332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii))); and (5) ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'' (  336.50(c)(1)
and 338.50(c)(3)). The comment stated that, in some instances, the paired terms already appear in the cited regulations
and, in other cases, the alternative terms may be better understood by consumers. The comment mentioned the following
examples: ``Lung'' disease may be better understood than the more technical ``pulmonary'' disease, and ``persistent''
may be better understood than ``chronic.'' The comment stated its understanding that the rule is intended only to
provide a glossary of comparable terms that may be used interchangeably, not to make substantive changes in the underlying
required label statements. For example, the comment mentioned that the rule would not permit the term ``health professional''
as an alternative to the terms ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' because a ``health professional'' may include pharmacists,
nurses, midwives, and others who are not licensed to practice medicine. The comment requested that the agency clarify
that this rule applies only to OTC drug monograph language otherwise required to be declared verbatim in OTC drug product
labeling. The comment added that the rule would not apply to or otherwise affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading
alternative terms that can be used for monograph indications. 
The other comment also proposed that the terms ``assistance'' and ``help'' be allowed interchangeably in the general
overdose warning, which states: ``In case of accidental ingestion, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison
Control Center immediately.'' 


II. The Agency's Final Conclusions


The agency has carefully evaluated the comments' proposals for the interchangeable use of certain terms and concludes
that the interchangeable terms suggested by the comments (``clean'' or ``cleanse,'' ``persist(s)'' or ``continue(s),''
``assistance'' or ``help,'' and ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'') are acceptable and will help promote better label readability.

In addition, the agency has determined that the terms ``indication(s)'' or ``use(s)'' should be allowed to be used
interchangeably. The agency considers the term ``use(s)'' to be simpler and better understood by consumers than
the term ``indication(s).'' The agency is including this option in  330.1(i).
The agency disagrees with the interchangeable use of the words ``chronic'' and ``persistent.'' ``Chronic,'' by
definition, is of long duration, or may be subject to habit or disease for a lengthy period (Ref. 1). On the other hand,
``persistent,'' by definition, is refusing to let go, insistently repetitive or continuous, or enduring (Ref. 2).
While ``chronic'' is also ``persistent,'' ``persistent'' is not necessarily ``chronic.'' For instance, a chronic
cough denotes one that has gone on for a lengthy period of time, while a persistent cough could be one of recent onset
that does not respond to treatment. Thus, a chronic cough and a persistent cough may be the same, or they could be two
separate entities. Therefore, interchangeable use of the terms ``chronic'' and ``persistent'' is not included
in the final rule.

This final rule does not make substantive changes in the language required in OTC drug monographs. The rule allows
for alternative terminology for certain terms that are sufficiently comparable to be used interchangeably. The
rule does not affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading terminology as an alternative to monograph indications
in accord with  330.1(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii).
The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule and determined that it does not require either
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). This final rule provides alternative labeling options
that can be implemented at very little cost by manufacturers at the next printing of labels, for those products for
which the manufacturer chooses to make a change. Thus, the rule will have no significant economic impact. The agency
concludes that the final rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies
that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Dandruff, Seborrheic Dermatitis, and Psoriasis Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Amendment to the
Monograph



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule amending the final monograph for over-the-counter
(OTC) dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products to include 0.6 percent micronized selenium
sulfide for the control of dandruff. This final rule is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by
FDA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63554), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis
drug products in subpart H of part 358 (21 CFR part 358, subpart H). The monograph lists selenium sulfide 1 percent in
 358.710(a)(5) as an active ingredient that is used for the control of dandruff. The selenium sulfide included
in the monograph is not micronized (reduced to a fine particle size). 


 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17554), the agency published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the final monograph for
OTC dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products to include 0.6 percent micronized selenium sulfide
in  358.710(a) as an active ingredient for the control of dandruff. The agency also proposed to add the following
definition for micronized selenium sulfide in  358.703(e): ``Selenium sulfide that has been finely ground
and that has a median particle size of approximately 5 micrometers ( u m), with not more than 0.1 percent of the particles
greater than 15  u m and not more than 0.1 percent of the particles less than 0.5  u m.'' Interested persons were
invited to submit written comments and comments on the agency's economic impact determination by June 4, 1993.
 No comments were received in response to the proposed amendment. As discussed in the proposal (58 FR 17554 at 17556),
the agency advised that any final rule resulting from this proposed rule would be effective 12 months after its date
of publication in the 

Federal Register

. Therefore, on or after January 30, 1995, any OTC drug product that is not in compliance with this amendment to the final
rule may not be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it
is the subject of an approved application or abbreviated application. Further, any OTC drug product subject to the
rule that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the rule must be in compliance with the rule regardless
of the date that the product was initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.
Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the rule at the earliest possible date.
 No comments were received in response to the agency's request for specific comment on the economic impact of this rulemaking
(58 FR 17554 at 17557). The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule in conjunction with other
rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.
The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute
a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12866. The agency therefore concludes that
no one of these rules, including this amendment of the final monograph for OTC dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and
psoriasis drug products, is a major rule.
 The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug review was not likely to have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).
That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibility analysis in the event that an individual rule might
impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemaking for OTC dandruff,
seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small businesses. This
final rule will not remove any existing products from the market or require any reformulation or relabeling of existing
products. The final rule will increase the scope of active ingredients available to industry for this class of OTC
drug products. This final rule would allow OTC drug products containing 0.6 percent micronized selenium sulfide
and labeled for the control of dandruff to be marketed without having to obtain an approved application, as is currently
required. This will be beneficial to small manufacturers. Therefore, the agency certifies that this final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
 The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 358

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Illinois

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 24, 1993, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposed to approve a January 4, 1989
revision to the Illinois sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) State Implementation Plan (SIP), and solicited public comment on the proposed action. This document responds to
the public comments received and announces approval of the requested revision, which amends the SIP to provide SO

2

 emission limits for the Shell Oil Complex in Roxana, Wood River Township, Illinois. This action also clarifies USEPA's
approval of related Illinois SO

2

 rules which were included in Illinois' January 4, 1989 submittal but were subsequently revised and resubmitted.
The USEPA's approval of these rules satisfies the September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency for Wood River Township.



The USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of
the Clean Air Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Summary of State Submittal



On September 28, 1984, USEPA informed the Governor of Illinois that the Illinois SO

2

 SIP was inadequate to protect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in Alton and Wood River Townships
of Madison County, Illinois, and requested that the State submit revisions to the SIP to address the inadequacy. The
determination that the SIP needed to be revised was based on modeling performed by the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA) for a regional study which included Madison County. Modeled violations of the NAAQS in Wood River Township
were attributed primarily to the Shell Oil refinery complex in Roxana, Illinois. IEPA was able to demonstrate NAAQS
attainment in the Wood River area through significant emission reductions at the Shell Oil complex. The Shell Oil
emission limits are set forth at 35 Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC) 214.382, and were submitted to USEPA as a
revision to the Illinois SO

2

 SIP on January 4, 1989.

On March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15824), USEPA stated that the January 4, 1989 submittal could be approved if Illinois placed
a set of recordkeeping and reporting requirements for enforcement purposes into a federally enforceable State operating
permit for the Shell Oil Company. Operating permits issued under Illinois' federally enforceable operating permit
program, which was approved and incorporated into the Illinois SIP by USEPA on December 17, 1992 (57 FR 59928) at 40
CFR 52.737, are federally enforceable parts of the SIP upon issuance by the State, unless USEPA deems them not federally
enforceable. The USEPA transmitted a list of the necessary permit conditions for Shell Oil in a June 12, 1992 letter
to the State. On November 10, 1992, the Shell Oil Company applied for an operating permit which would include the recordkeeping
and reporting requirements identified by USEPA. On September 1, 1993, a public hearing was held in Wood River, Illinois,
to receive comments on the Shell Oil permit. Shell Oil's operating permit (I.D. Number 199090AAA) was issued on November
2, 1993, in accordance with the requirements of Illinois' federally approved SIP. On December 27, 1993, USEPA determined
that permit number 199090AAA meets the requirements for Federal enforceability. Permit number 199090AAA adequately
addresses the enforceability deficiencies in 35 IAC 214.382 by incorporating the recordkeeping and reporting requirements
included in the June 12, 1992 letter. Because it is federally enforceable, this operating permit supplements Illinois'
January 4, 1989 SIP submittal and renders the January 4, 1989 submittal fully approvable.

II. Public Comments/USEPA Response



Two public comments were received by USEPA regarding the March 24, 1993 proposed rule.



Public Comment:

 On April 22, 1993, USEPA received a comment from the Wood River Manufacturing Complex (Shell Oil), which stated that
the Shell Oil Company supports the finalization of USEPA's proposed rulemaking action.



USEPA Response:

 No response is necessary.



Public Comment:

 On April 23, 1993, USEPA received comments on behalf of the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (Smurfit), which operates
a facility in Alton Township, Madison County. Smurfit does not appear to object to the substance of the Wood River Township
SIP revision, but believes that USEPA should not approve the January 4, 1989 submittal for Wood River Township until
the SO

2

 attainment status of Alton Township has been finalized. Referring to USEPA's September 22, 1992 (57 FR 43846) action,
in which USEPA proposed to redesignate Alton, Granite City, and Nameoki Townships, Madison County, to nonattainment
for SO

2

, Smurfit stated that any designation for Madison County regarding SO

2

 should be consistent between Alton Township, Madison County, and Wood River Township, Madison County. Smurfit believes
that Alton Township should not be redesignated to nonattainment if Wood River Township is excluded from the nonattainment
area. Smurfit argues that emissions from Wood River Township contribute to ambient SO

2

 concentrations in Alton Township, and that USEPA's approval of the January 4, 1989 SIP revision should be deferred
until the State determines that the sources in Wood River Township will not interfere with Alton Township's ability
to attain the SO

2

 ambient standard. Smurfit remarked that it would not dispute USEPA's proposed approval of the January 4, 1989 submittal
for Wood River if Alton Township were to remain designated attainment for SO

2

.



USEPA Response:

 The January 4, 1989 Wood River SO

2

 SIP was submitted in response to a September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency. The USEPA's approval of the January
4, 1989 SIP revision for Wood River Township addresses this outstanding notice of SIP deficiency for the area. It in
no way precludes USEPA from redesignating Wood River Township to nonattainment for SO

2

 at a later date, if evidence exists which indicates the necessity for redesignation. Dispersion modeling studies
associated with Illinois' SO

2

 SIP development have shown that sources in Wood River Township are not currently causing NAAQS violations in Alton
Township.

Alton Township was initially cited for SIP deficiencies along with Wood River Township on September 28, 1984. On January
28, 1991, USEPA advised the Governor of Illinois that the whole of Madison County should be designated nonattainment
for SO

2

. In a letter to USEPA dated March 14, 1991, the Governor of Illinois stated that if a nonattainment designation was
necessary pursuant to the 1990 Amendments of the Clean Air Act, only Alton, Granite City, and Nameoki Townships in
Madison County should be designated, rather than the entire county. The Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency also stated in a separate letter to USEPA dated March 14, 1991 that Illinois' SO

2

 SIP was deficient for these townships. Since 1991, IEPA has worked with Alton Township industries to address SO

2

 attainment issues. IEPA requested that Wood River Township remain attainment for SO

2

, since a SIP addressing deficiencies in the area had been submitted on January 4, 1989.

On December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67334), USEPA published its intent to defer the final designation to nonattainment of these
townships, as the State is working to expeditiously correct the SIP deficiencies. The State submitted a SIP revision
for Alton Township on November 18, 1993. USEPA will take action upon this submittal and make a final determination
of Alton Township's attainment status in a subsequent action.



III. Final Rulemaking Actions



1. Based on the information contained in the State's January 4, 1989 submittal, and in the federally enforceable operating
permit issued to the Shell Oil Company on November 2, 1993, and in consideration of the public comments received on
USEPA's March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15824) proposed rule, USEPA is approving amendments to 35 IAC 214.102 and 214.382. The
USEPA's approval of these rules satisfies the September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency for Wood River Township,
Madison County, Illinois.

In addition to the new rules covering the Shell Oil facility, the January 4, 1989 submittal includes amendments to
Illinois' SO

2

 Measurement Methods (35 IAC 214.101) and Incorporations by Reference (35 IAC 214.104). However, further amendments
to 35 IAC 214.101 and 214.104 were submitted to USEPA on February 8, 1991. On December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66003), USEPA proposed
to approve these rules, as submitted on February 8, 1991. On June 26, 1992 (57 FR 28617), USEPA approved 35 IAC 214.101
and incorporated it by reference into the Illinois SO

2

 SIP. The USEPA is taking no action on the version of 35 IAC 214.101 which was submitted on January 4, 1989, since the version
approved on June 26, 1992 supersedes this submittal.

2. On December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66003), the USEPA proposed to approve 35 IAC 214.104, Incorporations by Reference, which
was adopted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board at 15 Ill. Reg. 1017 and became effective January 15, 1991. No public
comments were received in response to USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. The USEPA is therefore approving the incorporation
of this rule into the Illinois SO

2

 SIP. 

The following table summarizes USEPA's final rulemaking actions on the rules listed below.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 29, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Assistance Program Plan for the State
of Colorado



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 26, 1993, EPA published the notice of proposed rulemaking to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revision submitted by the State of Colorado for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Assistance Program (PROGRAM)
in the State. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507
of the Clean Air Act (Act), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory
information necessary to comply with the Act. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposal. No comments
were received pursuant to this proposed action. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revision to
the Colorado SIP for establishing a PROGRAM in the State.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 


Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM
as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
to oversee these PROGRAMS and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of title V of the Act. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
The State of Colorado has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order
to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: 



(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses; 
(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.



II. Summary of Submittal


The State of Colorado has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all
required PROGRAM elements. At a public hearing held before the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (Commission)
on October 15, 1992, the plan for the PROGRAM was approved. A notice of approval dated October 30, 1992, was issued by
the Technical Secretary of the Commission adopting the PROGRAM plan. Legal authority to implement the PROGRAM was
obtained through Senate Bill 105 and is contained in the Colorado Act (ACT) Section 25-7-109.2. The collection
of fees to cover the cost of implementing the PROGRAM is contained in the ACT Section 25-7-114.7. The Colorado
PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Colorado on November 18, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative
and technical completeness. In a letter dated December 23, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State
in order to make a positive determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January
7, 1993, EPA notified the State in a letter dated January 26, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically
complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers.

The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its PROGRAM plan pages 6 through 9 to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. Additionally, a task force has been established
to examine options for implementation of these six requirements, and prepare a report containing its recommendations.
The State has met the second PROGRAM element by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office
of Regulatory Reform, as specified in Section 25-7-109.2(5) of the ACT, and by outlining the powers and
duties of the Ombudsman on pages 4 and 5 of its PROGRAM plan. The State has met the third PROGRAM element by establishing
a Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of Colorado, as specified in Section 25-7-109.2(2)
of the ACT, and by outlining in its PROGRAM plan on pages 5 and 6 the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined,
which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally, the State of Colorado has established a mechanism for ascertaining
the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility
using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the Act. This mechanism is located on pages 2 and 3 of the State's PROGRAM
plan.


III. Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Colorado. The revision was made to satisfy the requirements
of section 507 of the Act. 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. This program does not impose any new regulatory burdens on
small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided
by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

List of Communities Eligible for the Sale of Flood Insurance 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These communities
have applied to the program and have agreed to enact certain floodplain management measures. The communities' participation
in the program authorizes the sale of flood insurance to owners of property located in the communities listed. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood
insurance is now available for property in the community. 


In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 
The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary. 


National Environmental Policy Act
 


This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Deputy Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U. S. C. 601 

et seq.

, because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale of flood insurance.



Regulatory Impact Analysis


This rule is not a major rule under Executive Order 11291, Federal Regulation, February 17, 1981, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp.,
p. 127. No regulatory impact analysis has been prepared. 


Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism



This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October
26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 252. 


Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform



This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195,

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Change in observer coverage; suspension of effectiveness.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On January 20, 1994, NMFS published a change in observer coverage for certain participants in the groundfish fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI). NMFS is suspending until February 13, 1994, the effectiveness of the
requirement for operators of catcher or processor vessels equal to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 m) length overall
(LOA) and less than 125 feet (38.1 m) LOA to have a NMFS-certified observer on board the vessel each day it is used to participate
in a directed fishery for groundfish in statistical area 517 during the period that the 1994 directed fishery is open
for Pacific cod in the BSAI management area. This action is necessary to provide adequate time for operators of catcher
or processor vessels to comply with the new observer requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

NMFS published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 65574, December 15, 1993) for public review and comment that proposed a change in 1994 observer coverage requirements
for vessels participating in a directed fishery for groundfish in statistical area 517 in the BSAI management area.
A rule document implementing this action became effective January 13, 1994, the date of filing with the Office of the
Federal Register (59 FR 3000, January 20, 1994). This action requires operators of catcher or processor vessels equal
to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA and less than 125 feet (38.1 m) LOA to have a NMFS-certified observer on board the
vessel each day that it is used to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish in statistical area 517 during the
period that the 1994 directed fishery is open for Pacific cod. Reasons for this action are set forth in the proposed
and final 

Federal Register

 rule documents.



The 30-day delayed effectiveness period under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act was waived
for reasons contained in the final rule document implementing the change in observer coverage. NMFS has determined
that not all vessel operators had sufficient notice of the change in observer coverage requirements to obtain a NMFS-certified
observer prior to the January 13, 1994, effective date. Therefore, NMFS is suspending the effectiveness of the requirement
until 12 noon A.l.t., February 13, 1994.



Classification



This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.25 and is in compliance with E.O. 12866. Because this action is required to provide
relief to vessel owners who otherwise would be unable to comply with observer coverage requirements, it is unnecessary
and not in the public interest to provide prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3). Also, because this action
temporarily relieves a restriction, it is being made effective immediately without a 30-day delay in effectiveness
under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; final apportionments of the 1994 Pacific cod total allowable catch among gear types and seasons.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 24 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and issues final regulations to implement the amendment that allocates
the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) among vessels using trawl, hook-and-line or pot gear, and jig gear through
1996. These regulations also authorize seasonal apportionments of the portion of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear. Consistent with the regulations implementing Amendment 24, NMFS also specifies
1994 gear allocations and seasonal apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using
hook-and-line or pot gear through 1996. This action is necessary to allocate Pacific cod among specified gear groups
to respond to socioeconomic needs of the fishing industry that have been identified by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council (Council). It is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish and other fish resources
and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI are managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) in accordance with the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries
appear at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.



At its June 1993 meeting, the Council adopted Amendment 24 and recommended that NMFS prepare rulemaking to implement
the amendment. A notice of availability of Amendment 24 was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 15, 1993 (58 FR 53497), and invited comment on the amendment through December 7, 1993. No written comments
were received. A proposed rule to implement Amendment 24 was published in the 

Federal Register

 October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57803). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through December 6, 1993. Five letters addressing
eight comments were received and are summarized and responded to in the Response to Comments section, below.

Amendment 24 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce on January 5, 1994, under section 304(b) of the Magnuson Act.
This amendment establishes FMP authority to allocate the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using different gear types
and to seasonally apportion gear allocations of Pacific cod. Upon reviewing the reasons for Amendment 24, and the
comments on the proposed rule to implement it, NMFS has determined that this action is necessary for fishery conservation
and management and implements the following three measures through December 31, 1996, under authority of Amendment
24.

1. The BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated annually among gear types as follows: 2 percent to
vessels using jig gear; 44 percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear; and 54 percent to vessels using trawl
gear. In monitoring the use of these gear allocations, all cod catch and cod bycatch by each of the three gear groups
will be counted against its allocation;

2. The Secretary, after consultation with the Council, is authorized to seasonally apportion the amount of the Pacific
cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. Seasonal apportionments will be divided among three
seasons of 4 months duration each, and will be established through the annual September-December specifications
process ( 675.20(a)). Any seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using
hook-and-line or pot gear must be based on the following information: (A) Seasonal distribution of prohibited species;
(B) seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited species distribution; (C) expected variations
in Pacific halibut bycatch rates throughout the fishing year; and (D) economic effects of any seasonal apportionment
of Pacific cod on the hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries.

3. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) is authorized to reallocate Pacific cod from vessels using
trawl gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and vice versa, anytime during the year the Regional Director
determines that one gear group or the other will not be able to harvest its allocation of Pacific cod. That portion of
the jig gear allocation that is expected to go unharvested may be transferred to vessels using trawl and hook-and-line
or pot gear at the beginning of the third 4-month season.

The intent of the measures implemented under Amendment 24 is to provide stability in the trawl gear and fixed gear (jig,
hook-and-line and pot) fisheries by establishing designated allocations of the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using
these different gear types. Further explanation of, and reasons for, these measures are contained in the preamble
to the proposed rule (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993).



1994 Specifications of the Pacific cod TAC



The Council recommended proposed 1994 gear allocations and seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod
allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear at its September 1993 meeting. The proposed specifications
for the 1994 Pacific cod fishery were published in the 

Federal Register

 for public review and comment as part of the proposed rule implementing Amendment 24 (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993).
At its December 1993 meeting, the Council reaffirmed its September recommendations. NMFS concurs with the Council's
recommendations and has included the final specifications for the 1994 Pacific cod fisheries in this action implementing
Amendment 24 (Tables 1 and 2).

Consistent with regulations authorizing seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear ( 675.20(a)(2)(v)), a discussion of the seasonal apportionments relative
to the seasonal distribution of Pacific cod and prohibited species, prohibited species bycatch rates, and economic
effects on the hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries is presented in the preamble to the proposed rule implementing
Amendment 24 (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993). In 1994, 1995, and 1996, the proposed and final specifications for Pacific
cod will be established through the annual TAC specification process undertaken by NMFS and the Council during the
September and December Council meetings each year (  675.20(a)(2) and 675.21(b)(3)).

Response to Comments 



Five letters of comments were received within the comment period that ended December 6, 1993. Four of the letters were
supportive of Amendment 24 and one letter opposed it. A summary of comments and NMFS's response follow. 



Comment 1.

 The rule implementing Amendment 24 should include a prohibition against using both trawl and fixed gear onboard a
vessel to fish for groundfish during a year to prevent vessels that use one gear type from gaining access to another
gear type's Pacific cod allocation. 



Response.

 Limitations on the use of trawl or fixed gear to fish for Pacific cod or other groundfish species are beyond the scope
of Amendment 24 as adopted by the Council and approved by the Secretary. Prohibitions against using more than one gear
type to fish for Pacific cod during a year would require a separate amendment to the FMP and cannot be implemented at
this time. 



Comment 2.

 The proposed 1994 seasonal apportionment of the amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or
pot gear is supported. 



Response.

 NMFS is implementing the seasonal apportionment of the amount of Pacific cod TAC that is allocated to vessels using
hook-and-line or pot gear as proposed. 



Comment 3.

 The regulations implementing Amendment 24 provide an equitable way to manage the Pacific cod fishery to reduce waste,
periods of high bycatch, and gear conflicts. Allocation of Pacific cod among gear types is an important management
measure during the period the Council is developing a comprehensive plan to manage the groundfish fisheries. The
implementation of the amendment should proceed without delay. 



Response.

 NMFS concurs. Amendment 24 has been approved and implementing regulations are issued under the schedule set forth
under section 305(a) of the Magnuson Act. 



Comment 4.

 Preferential allocation of Pacific cod or other groundfish species to the newly emergent longline freezer fleet
in the BSAI is opposed. The Bering Sea cod fishery was developed by the trawl fleet and criteria historically applied
by the Council in resource allocation issues would favor the BSAI trawl fleet in any cod allocation dispute with longline
vessels. Although the trawl industry generally believes that a 60-40 split of the Pacific cod TAC between trawl
and fixed gear would more closely reflect current utilization levels, the fixed gear allocation implemented under
Amendment 24 will provide benefits from the stabilization of the trawl and fixed gear fisheries for Pacific cod. Such
stabilization will allow for better and more efficient planning and will enable the trawl and fixed gear fleets to
assure their respective markets of a dependable and predictable supply of product. 



Response.

 NMFS recognizes that the development of Amendment 24 and alternatives for allocating Pacific cod TAC among different
gear groups was a contentious issue that required significant input and effort by the industry to help resolve problems
addressed by the Council. NMFS concurs that the fixed allocation of the Pacific cod TAC among gear groups will provide
stability to the Pacific cod fisheries during the period the Council is developing a long-term comprehensive plan
for the management of the Alaska groundfish resources. 



Comment 5.

 The annual apportionment of the halibut bycatch limit established for BSAI fisheries and seasons should support
the annual seasonal apportionment of Pacific cod. 



Response.

 Regulations implementing Amendment 24 do not govern how Pacific halibut bycatch limits are apportioned among fisheries,
although gear specific allocations of Pacific cod will be considered when apportioning prohibited species bycatch
limits among fisheries and seasons during the annual specification process ( 675.21(b)(3)). As required
by regulations at 
 675.21(b)(3), NMFS will review the seasonal apportionment of the amount of Pacific halibut bycatch mortality
specified for the Pacific cod fisheries when the agency makes a final determination on the 1994 groundfish specifications.

Comment 6.

 The trawl industry generally supports Amendment 24 as a management measure that will support the stabilization of
the Pacific cod fisheries provided that the annual process for apportioning the Pacific halibut trawl bycatch mortality
limit among trawl fisheries is not used to undermine the intent of this amendment. Efforts by representatives for
the fixed gear fisheries to restrict the amount of halibut annually apportioned to the Pacific cod trawl fishery would
prevent the trawl gear allocation of Pacific cod from being harvested and result in a 

de facto

 preferential allocation of cod to the fixed gear fleet. The Council and NMFS must ensure that the annual process for
the apportionment of PSC limits among trawl fisheries does not lead to the instability that Amendment 24 is intended
to avoid. 



Response.

 NMFS acknowledges that significant flexibility exists on how PSC limits are annually apportioned among fisheries
and seasons. The resulting apportionments must be justified based on regulatory intent to optimize the harvest of
available groundfish under a given PSC limit ( 675.21 (b)(1) and (b)(3)). NMFS believes that the annual prohibited
species bycatch allowances specified for the Pacific cod trawl fishery should be based on anticipated prohibited
species bycatch needs. NMFS has advised the Council that it should consider PSC limit apportionments among fisheries
and seasons that are consistent with regulations implementing Amendment 24. Nonetheless, the PSC limits established
for the BSAI trawl fisheries likely will continue to constrain the ability of trawl fisheries to harvest available
groundfish. 



Comment 7.

 Amendment 24, as adopted by the Council, did not establish a fixed allocation of the BSAI trawl halibut bycatch limit
to the Pacific cod trawl fishery and the proposed rule did not rectify this omission. This measure is necessary for
reasons stated in Comment 6. The anticipated benefits under Amendment 24 in terms of fishery stability will not be
realized as long as the possibility exists for fixed gear interests to continue to use the annual specification process
to constrain the amount of halibut bycatch apportioned to the Pacific cod trawl fishery, thereby achieving a 

de facto

 preferential allocation to the fixed gear fleet. 



Response.

 A separate amendment to the FMP would be needed to establish a fixed allocation of the trawl halibut PSC limit to the
BSAI Pacific cod trawl fishery. This measure could not be implemented as a regulatory amendment and included in the
proposed rule to implement Amendment 24. The response to Comment 6 further describes NMFS's position on this issue.
The Council may address this issue in the future. 



Comment 8.

 Pacific cod catch during the duration of Amendment 24 should not be considered in calculating quota shares under any
individual transferrable quota (ITQ) program the Council may adopt in the future because gear allocations of Pacific
cod under Amendment 24 may alter catch patterns or otherwise skew the proportion of Pacific cod harvested by any gear
type. 



Response.

 ITQs are not the subject of this rulemaking. The Council and the Secretary have not determined whether access to the
fishery will be controlled, or if a limited access system will be implemented. Once such determinations are made,
eligibility criteria for participation in the fishery will be determined. 



Classification 



NMFS prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA), which concludes that this rule could have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of this analysis is available from the Council (see

General limitations. 


(a) * * * 
(2) * * * 
(iv) Applicable through December 31, 1996. 

(A) The TAC of Pacific cod, after subtraction of reserves, will be allocated 2 percent to vessels using jig gear, 44
percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 54 percent to vessels using trawl gear. The Regional Director
may establish separate directed fishing allowances and prohibitions authorized under paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9)

(v) 

Applicable through December 31, 1996. 

In the publications of proposed and final harvest limit specifications required under  675.20(a) of this part,
the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, may seasonally apportion the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated
to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section among the following three periods:
January 1 through April 30; May 1 through August 31; and September 1 through December 31. The Secretary will base any
seasonal apportionment of the Pacific cod allocation for vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear on the following
information: 
(A) Seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited species distribution; 

(B) Expected variations in prohibited species bycatch rates experienced in the Pacific cod fisheries throughout
the fishing year; and 
(C) Economic effects of any seasonal apportionment of Pacific cod on the hook-and-line and pot-gear fisheries. 
(3) * * * 
(iv) 

Applicable through December 31, 1996. 

Any amounts of the nonspecific reserve that are apportioned to Pacific cod as provided by paragraph (b) of this section
must be apportioned between vessels using jig, hook-and-line or pot, and trawl gear in the same proportion specified
in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, unless the Regional Director determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)
of this section or paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C) of this section that vessels using a certain gear type will not be able to

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine
drug products to include the ingredient doxylamine succinate. FDA is issuing this final rule after considering extensive
information concerning this ingredient and the recommendations of its Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee
(NDAC), which met on June 28, 1993, to consider potential labeling for doxylamine succinate regarding the results
of toxicology testing conducted under the National Toxicology Program (NTP). This final rule is part of the ongoing
review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of September 9, 1976 (41 FR 38312), FDA published, under  330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking for OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and antiasthmatic drug products. In that notice,
the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products (the Panel)
recommended that doxylamine succinate be generally recognized as safe and effective (Category I) as an OTC antihistamine
at a dosage level of 7.5 to 12.5 milligrams (mg) (41 FR 38312 at 38385 through 38387). At that time, the agency concluded
that doxylamine succinate should remain a prescription drug at dosage levels above 7.5 mg because it causes a high
incidence of drowsiness compared to other OTC antihistamines (41 FR 38312 at 38313). Subsequently, after evaluating
extensive data on the safety of doxylamine succinate, the agency determined that doxylamine succinate could be marketed
OTC at the Panel's recommended dosage. In the 

Federal Register

 of August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31892 at 31893 through 31903), the agency proposed monograph status at dosages of 7.5 to 12.5
mg. No comments were received in response to this proposal. 


In 1991, the agency received a report of a study on doxylamine succinate conducted by the National Center for Toxicological
Research (NCTR) (Ref. 1). The results of this study were under consideration when the agency published the final monograph
on OTC antihistamine drug products on December 9, 1992 (57 FR 58356). Accordingly, the agency deferred a decision
on doxylamine succinate at that time. 
The NCTR technical report concerns a 2-year carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity study of doxylamine succinate
in Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. The study was conducted under the auspices of the NTP. The study was prompted by
the National Cancer Institute's finding that methapyrilene, a similar antihistamine, is a potent liver carcinogen
in the rat (Ref. 2). Methapyrilene was removed from the market in 1979. The NCTR study on doxylamine succinate was reviewed
by the agency's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (the P-A Committee) on June 13 and 14, 1991 (Ref. 3). 
In the NCTR study (Ref. 1), doxylamine succinate was administered, ad libitum, as an admixture in the feed to male and
female rats at dose levels of 0, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 parts per million (ppm) for 2 years. Mice of both sexes received
food containing dose levels of 0, 190, 375, or 750 ppm. Each group contained 48 weanling animals per sex; the animals
were scheduled for sacrifice at the end of 104 weeks. An additional group of animals (9 rats and 12 mice per sex) in each
dose group was sacrificed at the end of 65 weeks. There were no significant treatment-related differences in survival
in either rats or mice. In rats, the highest doxylamine succinate dose group had final body weights that were 22.8 percent
(females) and 8.4 percent (males) lower than controls. A number of nonneoplastic lesions was observed in rats, including
fatty change, degeneration, and hyperplasia of the liver and increased cytoplasmic alteration in the salivary glands.
In mice, there was evidence of hepatotoxicity including hypertrophy, clear and mixed cell foci, and, in females,
fatty change. There also was a treatment-related increase in ``atypical'' hepatocytes in male mice. Both male and
female mice had a dose-related increase in thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia. There was a positive trend for increased
incidence with increasing dose for both hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in male rats. When the incidence
of adenomas and carcinomas was combined, the statistical test was positive (p < 0.01) and the incidence in the highest
dose group was significantly (p < 0.05) increased over that of controls. No treatment-related increase in neoplasms
was found in female rats. Although not statistically significant, one rat in each of the high dose groups of male and
female rats was found to have a pineal gland tumor, which is an extremely rare neoplasm in rats. In mice, doxylamine
succinate administration produced an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma in both males (p < 0.001)
and females (p < 0.001). Also, there was an increased incidence of follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid gland
in male (p < 0.05) and female (p < 0.0001) mice.
Although the rodent tumorigenicity studies were positive, doxylamine succinate tested negative overall in in vitro
tests for genotoxic activity (causing damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). Based on the overall assessment,
the tumorigenic responses observed in the rodent bioassays may relate to secondary mechanisms involving the induction
of liver microsomal enzymes, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, promotion of tumor potential in pre-existing susceptible
cells, or other processes. Such mechanisms may represent species-specific effects or threshold phenomena applicable
to rodents (under the conditions of the bioassay), but these mechanisms are considered of questionable significance
in humans.
Due to uncertainty concerning the relevance of these findings to human use, the agency asked its P-A Committee and
a number of consulting experts to evaluate the data and to advise the agency on whether doxylamine succinate should
continue to be marketed OTC. By a vote of five to one, the P-A Committee concluded at its June 13 and 14, 1991, meeting
that doxylamine succinate is not likely to have human carcinogenic potential. Again, by the same vote, the P-A Committee
recommended that doxylamine succinate could remain OTC, but that consumers should be alerted that these data exist.
The P-A Committee discussed labeling as a preferred means of providing this information (Ref. 3, pp. 175 through 182).
FDA subsequently developed possible labeling that could be used. This labeling included the warning: ``Use of this
product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains doxylamine succinate which has been determined to
produce tumors in laboratory animals.'' The agency requested the views of a national trade association of OTC drug
manufacturers on this suggested warning (Ref. 4). In response, the association asserted that such a warning would
be inappropriate (Ref. 5). The association stated that such a warning: (1) Would not ensure safe and effective product
use by consumers; (2) is not based on sound scientific data known to be relevant to the human condition; (3) is not understood
and actionable, in a meaningful way, by consumers; and (4) might reduce the impact of other warnings and occupy scarce
label space.
The association argued that the proposed warning does not meet the criteria of section 502(c) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352(c)). This part of the statute requires labeling information to be presented
in ``terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of
purchase and use.'' The association contended that the proposed warning effectively shifts the burden of determining
product safety from the agency to the consumer and then does not tell the consumer what action to take. In a subsequent
communication (Ref. 6), the association further argued that a warning statement in the labeling of doxylamine products
is not justified because the scientific data do not suggest a significant risk to humans, that such a warning would
be unprecedented, and that a label warning is not the appropriate means for disclosing this information. 
In 1992, the agency established a new advisory committee specifically for the review of OTC drugs, the Nonprescription
Drugs Advisory Committee (NDAC). The agency asked NDAC to consider the issue of a tumor statement in the labeling of
OTC drug products containing doxylamine succinate at its June 28, 1993, meeting. The agency presented a summary of
the NCTR data, possible labeling, and legal and compliance issues (Ref. 7). Other interested parties presented their
positions. The agency asked NDAC to consider the following questions: (1) Should a labeling statement be used to inform
consumers in place of other alternative approaches (no warning, prescription only status, removal from all marketing,
etc.)? (2) Is there a desirable risk-to-benefit relationship for labeling? (3) If the answer to both questions is
yes, what information should be included in the labeling and what language should be used that would be easily understood
by the average consumer? (4) How should information be presented to the consumer (i.e., under the ``Warning'' or some
other heading, visible at the point of purchase, on the immediate container, or in a package insert) and should the
information indicate that the product could be ``hazardous'' to health? 
After considering the available evidence, NDAC voted unanimously (10 to 0) to reaffirm the P-A Committee's recommendation
that doxylamine succinate remain OTC. NDAC also recommended (10 to 0) that there be no specific statement about tumors
in the labeling and urged FDA to write a fully descriptive article on the subject in the ``FDA Consumer'' magazine.

The agency has considered the two advisory committees' recommendations and concludes that doxylamine succinate
is safe and effective for OTC use as an antihistamine. Accordingly, the agency is including doxylamine succinate
in the final monograph for OTC antihistamine drug products. The agency is also developing an ``FDA Consumer'' article
and has issued a talk paper concerning the NCTR findings in animals to inform consumers of these data and the uncertainty
of their relevance to humans.

The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule and has determined that it does not require either
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). This rulemaking for OTC antihistamine drug products is
not expected to have an impact on small businesses. Doxylamine succinate remains available OTC. No product reformulations
will be required. Some minor relabeling will be necessary to meet the conditions of the final monograph. Manufacturers
will have 1 year to implement this relabeling. Thus, the impact of the final rule appears to be minimal. Therefore,
the agency concludes that the final rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency
certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
The agency is removing the exemption for certain drugs limited by new drug applications (NDA) to prescription sale
in  310.201(a)(13) (applicable to doxylamine succinate preparations) because most portions of that exemption
are superseded by the requirements of the antihistamine final monograph (21 CFR part 341). Section 310.201(a)(13)
does not apply to the use of doxylamine succinate as a nighttime sleep-aid, for which an NDA is required for marketing.

State Student Incentive Grant Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG) Program regulations to clarify them, to make minor
technical changes, and to implement statutory changes made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 to the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Secretary is revising the existing SSIG Program regulations to implement statutory changes required by the Higher
Education Amendments of 1992, enacted July 23, 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325) (1992 amendments), which amend the HEA.
These revised regulations also change the SSIG Program regulations to reduce burden and clarify existing rules.




The SSIG Program provides financial incentives for States to establish and to maintain financial assistance programs
that make grants and provide work-study assistance to students with substantial financial need. 

The SSIG Program supports National Education Goal 5, which calls for every adult American to be literate and possess
the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship. 

On July 2, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 36110). The major issues addressed by the proposed regulations are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. There
are two major differences between the NPRM and the final regulations. The first change is to revise the allotment formula
above the ``hold-harmless'' allotment of Federal funds each State received in fiscal year 1979 under the SSIG Program.
The ``hold-harmless'' amount of Federal funds is the SSIG Program allotment each State received in fiscal year 1979.
Under section 415B(a)(1) of the program statute, if an appropriation exceeds the fiscal year 1979 appropriation,
each State still would continue to receive at least its ``hold-harmless'' amount regardless of the results of the
allotment formula. Based on the comments received, a change was made in the final regulations to revise the allotment
formula above the ``hold-harmless'' level by redefining the term ``deemed eligible.'' The Secretary determines
the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of each
State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the
allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the ``average
grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of
SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching
the allotment. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most recently available data reported by each
State. The Secretary will allot additional SSIG funds to States above their ``hold-harmless'' amounts by using the
following steps: 

(1) Calculate the States' number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing
the amount of each State's SSIG funds expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated
funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States.

<TEXT>
 

(2) Calculate the States' projected allotments by dividing each State's number of students ``deemed eligible''
by the total number of students ``deemed eligible'' for all States, and then multiply that number by the appropriation.


(3) Compare each State's projected allotment calculated in step 2 to its ``hold-harmless'' amount and select only
States where the projected allotment exceeds the ``hold-harmless'' amount. 

(4) For the States selected in step 3, calculate the amount the Secretary will allot above the ``hold-harmless'' amount
to each of these States by dividing each of the selected State's number of students ``deemed eligible'' by the total
``deemed eligible'' students for all of the selected States and then multiply that number by the amount of the appropriation
above the total ``hold-harmless'' amount. 

The other change under  692.41(b) provides that, upon a showing of good cause, the Secretary may approve a State's
definition for ``independent student'' that varies from that term as defined in section 480(d) of the HEA. 



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



Fifteen commenters responded to the Secretary's invitation to comment on the NPRM. The following is an analysis of
comments and changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM. Substantative issues are discussed under
the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minor changes to the language published
in the NPRM_and requests for 
changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_may not be addressed.




Section 692.10 How Does the Secretary Allot Funds to the States? 





Comment

: Three commenters agreed with the revision in 
 692.10(b) of the proposed regulations to redefine students who are ``deemed eligible'' to participate in
the SSIG Program as students who were reported by the State as SSIG recipients in the most recently available performance
report data. 

Several commenters objected to the use of State-reported SSIG recipients in the most recently available performance
report data as students who are ``deemed eligible'' to participate in the SSIG Program. These commenters believed
that the number of recipients could be easily manipulated by States by inflating the number of awards to students.
Rather than provide substantial awards to the most needy students, States could inflate the number of students deemed
eligible by providing smaller awards to a larger number of students in order to receive a larger share of program funding
above the hold-harmless amount. 

A few commenters believed that the current allotment formula for awarding SSIG funds above the hold-harmless amount
should not be amended. These commenters felt that the current allotment formula based on the enrollment data for each
State is more objective and meaningful in distributing funds for the SSIG Program. 

Two commenters recommended that the allotment formula above the hold-harmless level should be based on the amount
of funds actually expended by each State to match its Federal allotment. 



Discussion

: The Secretary is amending the current allotment formula for awarding funds above the hold-harmless level because
it does not conform to section 415B(a)(1) of the HEA. Section 415B(a)(1) was amended by the Higher Education Amendments
of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-498), but the SSIG Program regulations were not amended to conform with this statutory change.


The Secretary is changing the allotment formula for funds above the hold-harmless level to one that counts, for purposes
of making allotments to States, the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program
as determined by the following formula. The Secretary divides the amount of each State's SSIG expenditures, including
both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per
student of all participating States in the most recent award year as reported by the State. The Secretary determines
the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the
total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated
funds matching the allotment. 

In the past, the Secretary has provided extreme flexibility to States in implementing the SSIG Program statute. It
is the Secretary's experience that mere head counts do not accurately reflect the participation of States in the joint
Federal-State SSIG Program. Moreover, this change responds to the concerns raised by some commenters that States
might manipulate a head-count of recipients and the concerns raised by other commenters that funding should be based
on the actual matching expenditures of the States. Furthermore, the Secretary collects the Federal and State SSIG
funding data and average grant award per student from each State's most recent SSIG Program performance report. By
using the most recently available performance report data, the States will not be required to conduct a new data collection.


Under section 415B(a)(1) of the program statute, this formula would be used only if an appropriation exceeds the fiscal
year 1979 appropriation. Each State still receives at least its ``hold-harmless'' amount. The Secretary believes
that by considering the amount of State SSIG expenditures in the calculation of the number of students ``deemed eligible,''
States are provided with incentive to increase the amount of funds they allocate to their SSIG Programs. In this way,
States that provide more State dollars will receive more Federal SSIG funds above the ``hold-harmless'' amount,
the allotment each State received in fiscal year 1979 under the SSIG Program. For States to exceed the allotment of
funds beyond the ``hold harmless'' amount, States would have to elect to include more of their State grant funds under
the SSIG Program in their calculation under  692.10(b). 

The Secretary believes that the change encourages the inclusion of additional State funds in the SSIG Program and,
as a result, would stabilize the grant funds available to students from the States. The Secretary also believes that
the revised formula provides for the best use of Federal funds under the program by: (1) Rewarding States that have
made a strong commitment of their State grant funds to the SSIG Program as reflected by the States' amount of State grant
funds; and (2) encouraging States to maintain or expand their commitment of their level of expenditures for State
grant programs. 



Changes

: A change has been made. The Secretary has amended 
 692.10(b) to provide that the Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate
in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of each State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment
and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating
States. The Secretary determines the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student
recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment
and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most
recently available data reported by each State. 



Section 692.21 What Requirements Must Be Met by a State Program? 





Comment

: One commenter stated that the Secretary should clarify  692.21(e) concerning whether fees may or may not be
collected in the case of decentralized State grant programs under which institutions award State grant funds as well
as institutional aid.

Discussion:

 If there is a fee for submitting and processing the State information on a form to make a determination of financial
need under the SSIG Program, the fee must be payable to the State regardless of whether the information may also be used
for institutional aid. In the case of a decentralized State grant program under which institutions participating
in the State's SSIG Program award State grant funds, funds awarded under these programs are still considered to be
State aid and not institutional aid. It is the responsibility of each State 
to ensure that institutions participating in the State's SSIG Program conform with this requirement. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 Two commenters stated that the term ``reasonable'' as listed in  692.21(g) should be clearly defined by the
Secretary with some specific parameters provided. 



Discussion:

 Section 692.21(g) provides that, if a State awards grants to independent students or to students who are less-than-full-time
students enrolled in an institution of higher education, a reasonable portion of the State's allocation must be awarded
to those students. The Secretary believes that in order to provide the States with the maximum amount of flexibility
under this provision, no specific parameters for the term ``reasonable'' should be provided. The Secretary on a case-by-case
basis, if necessary, will determine the reasonableness of the allocation. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 A few commenters believed that under  692.21(g), the Secretary requires that a State must award SSIG Program
grants to independent students or to students who are less-than-full-time students in reasonable proportion to
the State's allocation of SSIG Program funds. 

One commenter believed it was unwise to reserve a portion of very limited need-based grant aid for less-than-full-time
students because of the overwhelming numbers of very needy full-time students who cannot be served due to lack of adequate
funding. 



Discussion:

 Section 692.21(g) provides that, if a State awards grants to independent students or to students who are less-than-full-time
students enrolled in an institution of higher education, a reasonable portion of the State's allocation must be awarded
to those students. Neither the program statute nor  692.21(g) requires a State to award grants to independent
students or students who are less-than-full-time. If the State's allocation from the Secretary is based on a formula
that includes the financial need of students who are independent or attend an institution less-than-full-time,
then the State must ensure that those students receive a reasonable proportion of SSIG funds. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 692.21 What Requirements Must be met by a State Program? and 
Section 692.41 What Standards May a State Use to Determine Substantial Financial Need? 





Comment:

 Several commenters objected to the proposed requirement in  692.41(b) that States use the term ``independent
student'' as defined by section 480(d) of the HEA in a State's own need-analysis system or a need-analysis system combining
the State's system with the Federal system under part F of title IV of the HEA in order to obtain the Secretary's approval
of the State's system. 

Some commenters believed that the use of the Federal definition infringes upon the State's right to set priorities
for administering State grant funds and would limit the State's flexibility in awarding these funds. 

Some commenters also believed that they should have the flexibility to use their own State statutory or regulatory
definition of ``independent student'' and report any variance with the Federal definition on the State's annual
application to participate in the program. 

One commenter was concerned that, if the regulations are adopted as proposed, the States should be given an opportunity
to amend their statutory or regulatory definitions of ``independent student'' to conform with the Federal definition
by making the effective date of the provision begin with the 1995-96 award year. This effective date would provide
the States with time to amend their statutory or regulatory independent student definitions to conform with the Federal
definition. 

One commenter was concerned regarding whether the students selected for SSIG matching purposes by a State would reflect
the proportion of independent students in the State program. The commenter believed that the Secretary could achieve
the intent of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 by allowing States to submit changes to their applications and
programs. Each State's application would specify the proportion of independent students as defined in the State's
approved need-analysis system which are in the base used to allocate funds and the means by which the State would ensure
a
