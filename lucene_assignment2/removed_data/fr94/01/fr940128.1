Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan; Rules and Regulations; Realignment of Districts 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would change the boundaries of five of the seven districts established under the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Plan (Plan) to apportion membership on the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board). This action
is necessary to reflect shifts in production since the original districts were established. The Plan requires the
periodic realignment of the districts based on shifts in production to ensure equitable representation of producers
and handlers on the Board. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) (7 CFR part 1210). The Plan is
authorized under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. 4901-4916), hereinafter referred to
as the Act. 


The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. Small agricultural
service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of
less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000.
The majority of watermelon handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
The Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
(40 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581-0093, except for the Board nominee
background statement form which is assigned OMB number 0505-0001. This action adds no additional reporting
burden. 


Background 


Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers
of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer
and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary
to verify their reportings. 
Membership on the Board is determined on the basis of two producers and two handlers for each of seven districts established
under the Plan. The districts are required to have approximately equal annual production volume. The initial (and
current) districts were based on a three-year average production derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981. 
These districts are: 
District 

#

1_South Florida, including all areas south of State Highway 50. 
District 

#

2_North Florida, including all areas north of State Highway 50. 
District 

#

3_The States of Alabama and Georgia. 
District 

#

4_The States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.

District 

#

5_The States of Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. 
District 

#

6_The State of Texas. 




District 

#

7_The States of Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. 
The Plan provides that two years after its effective date (June 8, 1989) and at least every five years thereafter, the
Board should review the districts to determine whether realignment of districts is necessary. 
When making such reviews, the Plan specifies that the Board should consider such factors as the most recent three-year
USDA production reports or Board assessment reports, if USDA production reports are unavailable, shifts and trends
in quantities of watermelons produced, and any other relevant factors. 
The Plan further specifies that, as a result of such reviews, the Board may realign the districts subject to the approval
of the Secretary. Any such alignment should be recommended by the Board at least six months prior to the date of the call
for nominations and should become effective at least 
30 days prior to such date. 
In accordance with the Plan, the Board appointed a subcommittee to review production and assessment collections
in the current districts. During the review, the subcommittee used USDA and State production and marketing reports,
as well as data derived from Board assessment reports and field notes. The subcommittee focused on information collected
between 1990 and 1992. 
After reviewing the available information, the subcommittee recommended that the boundaries of Districts 3 through
7 be changed and that Districts 1 and 2 remain unchanged. In order for each district to represent approximately 3 million
hundredweights of annual watermelon production, the subcommittee's recommendation would: move Mississippi from
District 5 to District 3; move Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee from District 5 to District 4; move Wyoming, Montana,
Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and California north of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernadino counties
from District 7 to District 5; move Arkansas and Louisiana from District 5 to District 6; and move New Mexico from District
5 to District 7. 
The subcommittee's recommendation was approved by the Board's executive committee, and the full Board voted by mail
ballot. In the mail ballot, 19 members voted ``yes,'' 4 members voted ``no,'' and 5 members did not return a ballot.

Therefore, this proposal would realign the districts as follows: 
District 

#

1_South Florida, including all areas south of State Highway 50. 
District 

#

2_North Florida, including all areas north of State Highway 50. 
District 

#

3_The States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. 
District 

#

4_The States of Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia,
and West Virginia. 
District 

#

5_The States of California_north of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois,
Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,
Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
District 

#

6_The States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.

District 

#

7_The State of Arizona, the remainder of the State of California, including San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino
counties, and the State of New Mexico. 
The Board has recommended that the new districts become effective for the three-year term of office which begins on
January 1, 1995. If adopted, this proposal would affect the eligibility of three current Board members and could necessitate
Board member nomination meetings for Districts 4, 5, 6, and 7 in spring 1994. In the normal cycle of nominating approximately
one-third of the Board members each year, spring 1994 nomination meetings were already planned for Districts 2 and
3. 
In addition, if this proposal is adopted, it will be necessary to make a conforming change to  1210.401. Section
1210.401 currently states that the districts are defined in  1210.320 of the Plan. Since, this rule would define
new district boundaries in a new  1210.501, this rule would also change  1210.401(b) to reflect this new
section number.

Wart Remover Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human use; Proposed Amendment of the Final Monograph


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) wart
remover drug products to revise the directions for products containing 15 percent salicylic acid in a karaya gum,
glycol plaster vehicle. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 14, 1990 (55 FR 33246), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products (21 CFR part 358). The
final monograph included in  358.110(c) (21 CFR 358.110(c)) products containing 15 percent salicylic acid
in a karaya gum, glycol plaster vehicle. Such products were included in the monograph based on the agency's evaluation
of data from three clinical studies (Ref. 1) (see comment 13, 55 FR 33246 at 33253). The directions for such products
were included in  358.150(d)(3) (21 CFR 358.150(d)(3)), as follows:



``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly.'' (If appropriate:
``Cut 
plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply medicated plaster at bedtime, leave in place for at least 8 hours; in the morning, remove
plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed) for up to 12 weeks.''



In discussing the labeling for these products (also in comment 13), the agency stated:



If there are any special directions that relate to using a particular product, then such information should appear
as part of the manufacturer's additional directions for the product. The monograph provides the minimum directions
necessary for use of the product. Manufacturers may supplement these directions with additional information necessary
to use their specific product. For example, the agency notes that the manufacturer's directions for its specific
product include statements to ``keep plastic film on the top of pad facing up and to apply sticky bottom side to the wart.''
The agency finds no need to include such directions in this final monograph; however, manufacturers may add such information,
as appropriate, to the labeling of their products.




Subsequently, the agency became aware that a manufacturer of this product had the following additional statements
in its product's labeling (Ref. 2): (1) ``Smooth wart surface with emery file supplied,'' and (2) ``Apply a drop of
warm water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry.'' The agency has rereviewed the clinical studies (Ref. 1)
for this product and determined that this additional labeling information is based on the manner in which the clinical
studies were performed. The agency notes that use of an emery file and application of a drop of warm water to the wart
site as part of the directions for this type of product were not included in the labeling suggestions made by the manufacturer
when the final monograph was being prepared (see comment 13).

The agency is concerned that similar products in the marketplace may have different directions_some recommending
use of an emery file and a drop of warm water to prepare the wart site and others not mentioning use of an emery file and
a drop of warm water. The agency believes this situation could lead to consumer confusion. (Although the agency is
aware of only one such marketed product, this does not rule out small volume operations and private label products.)

The clinical studies (Ref. 1) did not show that using an emery file and a drop of warm water were necessary to prepare
the wart site before application of the medicated plaster. However, these studies also did not show that these procedures
were not necessary, that any adverse effects occurred, or that any interference with the product's safety and effectiveness
occurred when an emery file and a drop of warm water were used. Because the procedure used in the studies included the
use of an emery file and a drop of warm water, the agency has determined that these items should be part of the directions
for this product. The agency is also making a minor format revision in one sentence of the directions. Accordingly,
the agency is proposing to amend the directions in  358.150(d)(3) for 15 percent salicylic acid in a karaya gum,
glycol plaster vehicle, to read as follows:






For products containing salicylic acid identified in  358.110(c).

 ``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly. Gently
smooth wart surface with emery file supplied.'' (If appropriate: ``Cut plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply a drop of warm
water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry. Apply medicated plaster at bedtime and leave in place for at least
8 hours. In the morning, remove plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed)
for up to 12 weeks.''

The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting
from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.
The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute
a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12866. The agency therefore concludes that
no one of these rules, including this proposed rule amending the final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products,
is a major rule.
The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC 
drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibility
analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities.
However, this particular rulemaking for OTC wart remover drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small
business. The final rule may require some very minor relabeling; however, such relabeling should be a one time nominal
cost. The agency is currently aware of only one such product in the marketplace, and it already has this labeling. Other
manufacturers who may market this product will have 1 year after publication of the final rule to implement this labeling.
The cost to do so will be minimal. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC wart remover drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated
with relabeling or repackaging. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC wart remover drug products
should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that
are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Interested persons may, on or before March 29, 1994, submit written comments on the proposed regulation to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted
on or before March 29, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments and objections are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document
and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Minnesota 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, the USEPA is proposing to disapprove the revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP)
for sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of Air Quality Control Region 131. Assuming no other substantive, adverse public
comments are received, the USEPA will proceed with a final approval of the submittal when the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency (MPCA) addresses the concerns detailed in this notice and submits the Administrative Orders to USEPA
before the end of the 30-day comment period. The USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted
by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The revisions are the result of a call for SIP revision
issued by USEPA on December 5, 1984, based on monitored violations. The revisions in the Minnesota submittal are in
the form of non-expiring Findings and Orders for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen
and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company-Inver Hills Generating Facility. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


USEPA published the designation of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 as a primary nonattainment area for SO

2

 on March 3, 1978, and October 5, 1978. In response to Part D requirements of the Clean Air Act, Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency (MPCA) submitted a final SO

2

 plan on August 4, 1980. USEPA published its final rule approving and promulgating the Minnesota Part D SIP for SO

2

 for AQCR 131 on April 8, 1981 (46 FR 20996). On December 5, 1984 (49 FR 47488), USEPA issued a call for SIP revisions for
the Minnesota SO

2

 SIP for Dakota County declaring the SIP inadequate based on 1982 monitored violations. The SIP call required that
the MPCA submit a revision to the Twin Cities SO

2

 SIP demonstrating attainment of the SO

2

 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the Pine Bend Area by September 1985.
 
The promulgation of a Good Engineering Practice stack height rule, along with difficulties negotiating a control
strategy with Koch Refining Company, and the selection of an appropriate computer model, delayed the submittal.
On September 10, 1987, the MPCA submitted revisions to the operating permits for five sources and requested redesignation
to attainment for all of AQCR 131 except the Pine Bend and St. Paul Park areas. 

As a result of numerous USEPA comments, MPCA withdrew the Pine Bend SO

2

 SIP while passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments delayed action on the rest of the SO

2

 revisions for AQCR 131. 

On August 3, 1992, USEPA received from MPCA a revision to the SO

2

 plan for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131. The submittal consisted of administrative materials demonstrating
that the State had adopted the revision as required and that a public hearing was held. The submittal also contained
administrative orders and technical support for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Plant, Continental
Nitrogen and Resources Corporation, and Northern States Power-Inver Hills Generating Facility. The rest of AQCR
131, including the St. Paul Park Area, are being addressed in separate rulemakings.
On February 16, 1993, USEPA received an amendment to the original administrative order for Koch Refining Company.
The amendment revises the completion dates for construction and operation of a new stack and control equipment. 



II. Analysis of State Submittal 
 

This section will provide a review of:



(1) The attainment demonstration modeling methodology for the sources in the area;
(2) Specific aspects of the administrative orders (AOs); and 
(3) Whether the submittal meets the requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act.


Modeling Methodology


The short-term dispersion modeling was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-term (ISCST version
90346) model. Dispersion modeling for annual impacts was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Long-Term
(ISCLT version 90008) model. All modeling was conducted in accordance with applicable guidance in the ``Guideline
on Air Quality Models (Revised) (1986),'' and ``Supplement A (1987).'' The dispersion modeling reflects USEPA Good
Engineering Practice stack height regulations where applicable. The modeling also incorporated urban dispersion
coefficients using 1973-1977 Minneapolis/St. Paul hourly surface meteorological data and St. Cloud mixing
height data. These years were used to maintain consistency with the original SO

2

 SIP. Although there is no reason to believe the 1973-1977 meteorological data is not representative of current
meteorological conditions in the Dakota County area, it is suggested that future SIP revision modeling incorporate
the five most recent years of available meteorological data, as is stated in the guidance. Combined SO

2

 impacts resulting from modeling Koch Refinery, Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen Resource Corporation,
and Northern States Power, were calculated at 549 receptors, with model resolution ranging from 1,000 meters near
grid boundaries to 100 meters near hotspot locations. 
 Screening modeling was used initially to identify all events with the potential for an exceedance of the Ambient Air
Quality Standards. These critical events were further processed using refined modeling techniques to determine
if the NAAQS for SO

2

 were protected. Several operating scenarios were modeled. The highest, second-highest predicted concentrations
for the 3-hour and 24-hour averaging times, including background, were 965.1 and 361.6  u g/m

3

, respectively. Annual average impacts were predicted by using a refined modeling approach. The maximum annual predicted
concentration, including background, was 69.1  u g/m

3

.
Additional short-term modeling investigated interstate impacts at distances between 10 and 50 km from an MPCA monitor
site. The Wisconsin border is approximately 25 km to the east of the Koch Refinery facility. Modeling was performed
using worst-case emission parameters. The modeling results demonstrated that Dakota County SO

2

 emissions do not prevent attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS in any other State.


General Statutory Requirements


The purpose of this section is to discuss whether the submittal meets the statutory requirements set forth in the Clean
Air Act. The Pine Bend area of Dakota County, Minnesota is designated nonattainment for the primary NAAQS for SO

2

. As a result, SO

2

 nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of subpart 1 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly
section 172(c). 
 
Section 172(c)(1) states that part D plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACM), (e.g., RACT).
The definition of RACT for SO

2

 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS. The Minnesota submittal includes modeling which,
if comments are adequately addressed, demonstrates that the Pine Bend area of Dakota County will achieve attainment
of the SO

2

 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented by April 1, 1993. This satisfies the RACM requirements of the Clean
Air Act.
 
Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress''
is defined in section 171(B)(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emission of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable data.'' The Minnesota submittal provides for attainment of the NAAQS by
April 1, 1993.

Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO

2

 emissions in the Pine Bend nonattainment area was provided in Appendix D of the submittal.

Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the submittal be expressly identified
and quantified. The submittal provides for a zero growth margin.

Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source
permitting program for nonattainment areas has been submitted to USEPA by MPCA and is currently undergoing review.
It will be addressed in a separate rulemaking. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program is delegated
to Minnesota and a general permitting rule has been SIP approved.

Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. Some enforceability
concerns associated with the submittal are detailed in the next section. If these concerns are adequately addressed,
the limitations will be sufficient to provide for attainment.

Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of section 110(a)(2). A primary requirement of section 110(a)(2) is that
the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA certifies that a public
hearing was held on May 27, 1992.

Section 172(c)(8) states that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling
emission inventory and planning procedures. In the Dakota County submittal, no ``equivalent techniques'' were
used for modeling, emission inventory, and planning procedures.

Section 172(c)(9) requires the plan to provide for implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area
fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the primary NAAQS by the attainment date applicable under
this part (i.e. contingency measures). In the event of nonattainment of the SO

2

 NAAQS, the MPCA has the authority to enforce all provisions of the AOs, as well as all applicable State and Federal rules
and regulations.


Administrative Order Details
 


The purpose of this section is to provide details on the individual AOs and state any comments that apply. These comments,
provided by Region 5, must be adequately addressed before final approval of the SIP revision for Dakota County can
be published. 



Continental Nitrogen and Resources Corporation (CNRC)



The Rosemount CNRC facility has three boilers which discharge SO

2

 emissions into the atmosphere. The Company is required to limit emissions of SO

2

 from each of the 3 emission points to 1.5 pounds of SO

2

 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). In addition, the three boilers may not operate at a heat input greater
than that listed in Exhibit 1 of the AO. 

The Company is authorized to burn only natural gas and #6 fuel oil in the three boilers. The Company may not burn #6 fuel
oil with greater than 1.5 percent sulfur by weight. Other restrictions include a limit of no more than 16,000 gallons
of #6 fuel oil per 24-hour period (midnight to midnight), no more than 70,833 gallons of #6 fuel oil per month on a monthly,
12-month rolling average, and the Company cannot burn #6 fuel oil at more than two of the boilers at any one time.

Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through sampling and analyzing the #6 fuel oil for sulfur content
and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods. Also the Company shall measure the total gallons of #6
fuel oil burned at each emission unit. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination
of compliance with the order. 


Region 5 Comments:



The emission limits in the administrative order are written as pounds of SO

2

 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). None of the limits have an averaging time associated with them. This
leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case, the administrative order
should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to the emission limits.

The administrative order, Part V.B.2.b.1 & 2, states, in part, that the Company must retain records containing
information on sulfur content and heating value. The administrative order must include a formula to relate this information
to the emission limit in order to determine compliance.



Northern States Power



There are six distillate and residual oil fired gas turbines at the Northern States Power (NSP) facility which discharge
sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. The Company is limited to 1.1 lbs of SO

2

/mmBTU from each of the 6 emission units. Also, the Company may not operate the 6 gas turbines at greater than the rated
heat input described in Exhibit 1 of the AO. 

The Company is authorized to burn only distillate and residual fuel oil in each of the gas turbines, and the fuel oil
sulfur content may not exceed 1.0 percent by weight. In addition, the Company may not burn more than 8.75 million gallons
of fuel oil per month on a 12-month rolling average.
 
Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through either sampling and analyzing the fuel for sulfur
content and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods, or obtaining and retaining a fuel supplier certification.
Also, the Company is to measure the total gallons of fuel oil burned at each emission unit both on a 3-hour basis, and
a monthly, 12-month rolling average basis. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination
of compliance with the order.



Region 5 Comments:



The emission limits in the administrative order are written as lbs/mmBTU. None of the limits have an averaging time
associated with them. This leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case,
the administrative order should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to
the emission limits.

The Company is required to keep records on percent sulfur of the fuel, and heating value of the fuel. The administrative
order, Part IV.B.2.a., does not specify a formula which would convert this data to a lbs/mmBTU basis. This is necessary
since the emission limits are in lbs/mmBTU units. A formula is also required in the Annual Reports section of the administrative
order (Part V.B.).

Part of the demonstration of compliance with emission and operating limits involves obtaining and maintaining a
fuel supplier certification. The administrative order, Part I.D.1.a.4., states that the certification must include
the method used to determine the sulfur content of the fuel oil. It must be made clear that the method used must be an approved
ASTM method as listed in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 19,  5.2.2. 



Koch Refining Company



The AO for Koch Refining includes a compliance schedule for required modifications at various locations around the
facility. Each modification activity is accompanied by completion dates. All of the activities had been completed
at the time the submittal was sent to USEPA. 

The emission limits for the Refinery are listed in the AO and cover the Sulfur Reduction Unit (SRU) 1/2 facility, the
Sulfur Reduction Unit 3 and 4 facility, the Sulfur Reduction Unit 5 facility, the FCC facility emission points 5, 6,
and 8, the Oil Separation and Waste Treatment Plant (OSWTP), the Platformer facility, and the Powerformer facility.
The table lists emission limitations for each applicable SO

2

 standard averaging time, 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual. The 3-hour average is based on three consecutive one-hour
periods, the 24-hour is based on 24 consecutive one-hour periods, and the annual is based on a 12-month rolling average.

The emission limits for the Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit (KSAU) facility are listed in Table 3 of the AO and cover Absorber
emission points numbers 1 and 3. However, emission point 1 becomes inoperational when emission point 3 begins operation.
Again, the applicable averaging times are based the same as for the Refinery limits mentioned above. 
 
Koch Refinery may burn refinery fuel oil, from the refinery fuel oil distribution system, only at select locations.
The fuel oil limits on quantity and sulfur content are specified in Table 2 and Table 2a of the AO. The Refinery may burn
refinery fuel gas at specified locations. The Company may not put fuel gas into the refinery fuel gas distribution
system which contains greater that 0.10 grains of hydrogen sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas. The diesel fuel
used shall not have a sulfur content greater than 0.1 percent by weight. 

Fuel restrictions at the KSAU facility limit the Boiler to burning only refinery fuel gas, propane, or commercial
natural gas. The hydrogen sulfide content of refinery fuel gas burned at KSAU cannot exceed 0.10 grains of hydrogen
sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas.

Compliance with the various limitations and restrictions applied to Koch Refinery are detailed in the AO. The compliance
demonstration include calculations, monitoring, record keeping, diesel fuel certification, and stack tests.
Compliance with the emission limits at KSAU also consist of calculations, monitoring, and data and record keeping.



Region 5 Comments:



Flares nos. 5, 6, and 7 may only use gases from Refinery operations when the gases are from pressure relief, from upsets
of Refinery process equipment, or are required for equipment maintenance (Part II.B.6.C.). At all other times the
flares must burn natural gas. Information must be provided to justify not limiting these sources and not including
them in the modeling. 
Compliance for emission points 348, 458, and 459, is to be based on initial stack tests as specified in Table 1, note
#4. Some method needs to be specified for determining future compliance.

The administrative order states in Part V.C.2. that the company shall conduct performance stack tests to determine
compliance with the emission limitations and fuel restrictions outlined in the order as required by the Commissioner.
Stack tests must also be able to be required by appropriate USEPA personnel.

Exhibit 2-page 3 discusses the startup incinerators for SRU 3 and SRU 4. These startup incinerators operate
when tail gas bypasses the Shell Claus Offgas Treatment (SCOT) Units and SCOT Unit incinerators. Information must
be provided to justify not limiting or modeling these emission sources.

On page 9 of Exhibit 2, emission point 17 is listed as an active emission source. However, in Exhibit 2, Attachment 6
emission point 17 has a rated input of 0.0 mmBTU/hr. Also, emission point 17 was not included in the modeling demonstration.
If #17 is shutdown, it must be removed from reference in the administrative order.

On page 8 of Exhibit 5, the Company is required to measure the amount of hydrogen sulfide in sour water tank purge gas
by analysis once per calendar quarter. The limit on hydrogen sulfide in sour water tank purge gas is 162 parts per million
as a 3-hour average. We would request than analysis be conducted with increased frequency (e.g., daily).
 
 

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment


The USEPA is proposing disapproval of the Minnesota SIP revision for SO

2

 for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131, contained in the Administrative Orders for Koch Refining Company
and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company-Inver
Hills Generating Facility. However, if the above comments, detailed in this notice, are adequately addressed in
revisions to this plan, and those revisions are submitted to USEPA by the end of the 30-day comment period, then, assuming
no other substantive, adverse public comments are received, USEPA will proceed with a final rulemaking approving
the SIP revision as a whole including the supplemental submittal. If at the end of the 30-day comment period, the issues
are still unresolved, final rulemaking disapproving the SIP revision will be promulgated.
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments
received by February 28, 1994, will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
The USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not
affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in
place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability.
Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies
that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of 
fish and fishery products (hereinafter referred to as seafood). 
These procedures include the monitoring of selected processes in 
accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that 
can be used by food processors and importers. FDA is proposing 
these regulations because a system of preventive controls is the 
most effective and efficient way to ensure that these products 
are safe.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Overview 


The purpose of these proposed regulations is to establish 
mandatory preventive controls to ensure the safety of seafood 
products sold commercially in the United States and exported 
abroad. These preventive controls will be based on a system 
known as HACCP. HACCP is a system by which food processors and 
importers can evaluate the kinds of hazards that could affect 
their products, institute controls necessary to keep these 
hazards from occurring, monitor the performance of these 
controls, and maintain records of this monitoring as a matter of 
routine practice. 
FDA is proposing to require that domestic and foreign 
processors and importers adopt HACCP controls to prevent the 
occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these 
seafood products for consumers. If these regulations are 
adopted, FDA will review the adequacy of HACCP controls as part 
of its program of mandatory inspections and import examinations. 
Such a review will occur in addition to traditional inspection 
activities. FDA is also encouraging, but not proposing to 
require, that processors and importers adopt the same types of controls for nonsafety hazards relating to economic
adulteration 
and quality. 
FDA is proposing to make HACCP mandatory for the seafood 
industry for the following reasons: 
1. Adoption of HACCP controls by the seafood industry, 
coupled with inspections by FDA based on the HACCP system, will 
produce a more effective and more efficient system for ensuring 
the safety of seafood products than currently exists. The 
current inspection system places too great a burden on Government 
inspectors to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to 
address those problems. HACCP places primary responsibility upon 
the industry to demonstrate that hazards are understood and are 
being prevented. 
2. A nationally mandated HACCP system will provide a basis 
for enhanced consumer confidence in the safety of seafood 
products. Consumers should not be afraid to eat foods, such as 
seafood, that are recommended as useful lower fat and lower 
saturated fat substitutes for higher fat meats (Ref. 1, p. 13; 
Ref. 2, p. 21). 
3. The know-how for applying HACCP to seafood is in an 
advanced state of development. A considerable amount of work on 
applying HACCP to seafood has already been done by some States, 
academia, and the Federal Government as well as through 
cooperative activities between the Federal Government and 
industry and through independent industry efforts.

4. Seafood industry representatives have urged the 
Federal Government to institute a mandatory, HACCP-type 
inspection system for their products. 

5. A nationally mandated HACCP-type system of controls 
appears to be a prerequisite for continued access to world 
markets. 


II. Safety



A. Background 



Ensuring the safety of seafood presents special challenges 
to both the industry that produces it and to Government agencies 
charged with protecting the public health. Seafood is unique in 
many respects. While often thought of as homogeneous in nature, 
seafood is actually a variety of products encompassing literally 
hundreds of species that have little in common other than an 
aquatic origin. Collectively, seafoods have perhaps the most 
diverse and complex microbiology of any food commodity (Ref. 3, 
p. xi). 
The range of habitats for edible species is also 
extraordinary and diverse ranging from cold to warm water, bottom 
dwelling to surface feeding, deep sea to near shore, and fresh 
water to saltwater. Fish are exposed to the bacteria and viruses 
that naturally occur in their environment as well as to those 
that enter the water through pollution. Chemicals, some of which 
are toxic to humans, can accumulate in fish as well. Fish can 
also accumulate natural toxins and parasites that are specific to 
marine animals. As a consequence, fish are subject to a wide 
range of hazards before harvest. 



B. The Safety Data 



The question of how safe is the seafood in the marketplace 
has been the subject of public debate in recent years. This 
debate has occurred partly because precise data on the numbers 
and causes of foodborne illnesses in the United States do not 
exist. Foodborne illnesses tend to be significantly 
underreported to public health authorities. Data on foodborne 
illnesses that are meaningful from an epidemiological standpoint 
are difficult and expensive to develop. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) of the 
U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) compiles data in its Foodborne 
Disease Surveillance System that are reported from State and 
local health authorities. All foodborne illnesses are 
underreported to this system (Ref. 4). 

Nonetheless, CDCP data are the best available and can at 
least be used to identify trends and emerging concerns about 
various diseases (Ref. 5, p. 219). The data suggest that most 
seafood-related illnesses result from certain natural toxins in 
finfish and from viruses in molluscan shellfish consumed raw or 
partially cooked (Ref. 4). The wide range of other hazards that 
can affect seafood undoubtedly result in illnesses, but the 
available data indicate that such illnesses are not as common. 
Thus, according to the CDCP data, the actual occurrence of 
problems tends to be limited relative to the range of hazards 
that could cause problems and tends to be associated with a 
minority of commercially available species. 

In the CDCP system, seafood accounted for 4.8 percent of 
reported cases of foodborne illness for the period 1973 to 1987 
(Ref. 4). However, as CDCP has pointed out, variations in rates 
of underreporting among different foods and varying etiologies 
make it impossible to compare safety among different foods based 
solely on CDCP data (Ref. 4). This is certainly true for 
seafood. Some seafood-related illnesses tend to be overreported 
to CDCP's system relative to other foodborne diseases, due 
largely to their distinctive characteristics, while others are 
probably underreported relative to other causes because they are 
less distinctive and more difficult to diagnose (Ref. 4). 

FDA has attempted to determine the relative safety of 
seafood through risk assessment. The results of this effort 
indicate that the risk of illness associated with molluscan 
shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked is greater than for 
any cooked flesh food. However, seafood overall is as safe or 
safer than other flesh foods in terms of frequency of illness 
(Refs. 5, p. 25; and 6). 

The conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) 
Institute of Medicine, in its 1991 report entitled ``Seafood 
Safety,'' are consistent with the CDCP data and the FDA risk 
assessment. According to NAS, ``Most seafoods available to the 
U.S. public are wholesome and unlikely to cause illness in the 
consumer'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). Moreover, in reviewing the CDCP data, 
the report noted that the 23 percent increase in seafood 
consumption in the United States in the 10-year period ending 
1989 was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in reported 
seafood-borne illnesses (Ref. 7, p. 27). Nevertheless, as NAS 
pointed out, ``there are areas of risk'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). The 
report addressed at some length virtually every possible risk 
that could affect seafood and made numerous recommendations 
relating to existing and proposed control measures. NAS 
recommended that improvements be made in the present system of 
regulatory control (Ref. 7, p. 1) and repeatedly recommended 
HACCP controls wherever appropriate. ``Inspection and testing 
should focus on actual problems (as in HACCP systems),'' NAS 
concluded (Ref. 7, p. 16).

C. The Principal Hazards 



The most notable seafood-related hazards involve the 
following: 



1. Bacteria 



Because bacteria either naturally live in, or can survive 
in, aquatic habitats, there are a large number of pathogenic 
bacteria that can be found in seafood, particularly molluscan 
shellfish. Many of these bacteria are far more harmful to 
specific human subpopulations, such as the elderly, 
immunocompromised, or persons with specific underlying diseases, 
than to the population as a whole. The size of these 
subpopulations is increasing, however. Therefore, concerns about 
bacterial contamination of seafood, particularly molluscan 
shellfish, are increasing. 

In the United States, 4.4 percent of botulism outbreaks have 
been attributed to seafood. The predominant type of botulism 
organism in aquatic environments is the kind most readily 
destroyed by heat. Thus, many types of processing, if done 
properly, can negate the risk of botulism from seafood. 
Nonetheless, with the trend toward greater use of modified 
atmosphere and vacuum packaging (i.e., packaging that excludes 
oxygen) to enhance the shelf life and the desirability of 
refrigerated foods, traditional controls need to be enhanced 
because 

Clostridium botulinum

 can grow in the absence of oxygen. 

Other bacteria of concern include 

Listeria monocytogenes,

 a 
hazardous foodborne microorganism that is ubiquitous in nature 
and is commonly found in food processing environments; 


Salmonella,

 which is not a marine organism but can contaminate 
seafood through improper handling and sanitation practices; and 


Staphylococcus aureus,

 another pathogen associated with 
sanitation and handling (Ref. 8, pp. 14 and 15). 



2. Viruses 



Several viruses that are infectious to humans enter aquatic 
habitats through sewage. These viruses can concentrate in 
shellfish and be present and infective even when bacterial 
indicators of fecal pollution are absent. Viruses probably cause 
the bulk of seafood-associated disease, particularly the Norwalk 
and Norwalk-like agents, which are linked to the consumption of 
contaminated raw or undercooked molluscan shellfish (Ref. 7, p. 
30). 



3. Natural Toxins 



Problems associated with naturally occurring toxins in fish 
have been recognized for centuries. Ciguatera poisoning is 
perhaps the most significant problem associated with a natural 
toxin. The toxin is produced by microscopic organisms and can be 
transmitted to humans through the consumption of finfish that 
have eaten these organisms through the food chain (Ref. 7, p. 
89). The larger, more predacious fish (groupers, snappers, 
barracuda, amberjack) and reef fish belonging to the crevally or 
ulua (Carangidae) family are generally more likely to contain 
ciguatoxin than other types of fish (Ref. 7, p. 89). Because the 
toxin is heat stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat 
(Ref. 9, p. 1). 

On average, 70 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported 
annually in the United States and its possessions and territories 
(Ref. 7, p. 89). Deaths are rare, and the acute symptoms of the 
disease are usually of short duration; however, neurological 
symptoms can persist for extended periods. Ciguatera is 
geographically localized, with the majority of illnesses reported 
from tropical or subtropical areas. 

Other toxins of public health concern include domoic acid, 
which was detected in seafood from the U.S. Pacific coast for the 
first time in the fall and winter of 1991-1992 (Ref. 10, 
p. 1,113); and saxitoxin, or paralytic shellfish poison, which 
has periodically made molluscan bivalves toxic and has recently 
affected Pacific Northwest crab harvests (Ref. 11). 



4. Parasites 



Parasites, such as anasakid nematodes (round worms), 
naturally infect certain fish and ocean mammals (Ref. 12, p. 
724). Human parasitic infections almost always occur from the 
consumption of raw (sushi, sashimi) or undercooked fish. 
Historically, probably no more than five cases are reported on 
average in the United States each year and the likelihood of 
occurrence is estimated to be very low (Ref. 5, p. 25). Problems 
with parasites are avoidable through commercial freezing of the 
raw fish before consumption. 



5. Chemical Contaminants 



The presence of toxic chemicals in the aquatic environment 
creates the potential for contamination of seafood products. 
These chemicals include pesticides; other industrial chemicals, 
such as polychlorinated biphenyls; heavy metals, such as lead, 
cadmium, and mercury; and petroleum hydrocarbons.

Marine species, especially deep sea varieties, comprise the majority of seafood consumed in this country. This seafood
has little potential to contain most chemical contaminants at levels of toxicological concern (Ref. 13, p. 6). However,
there are some contaminants that can be present at significant levels, methylmercury in certain species being perhaps
the most notable. Fresh water species, especially nonmigratory bottom feeders, are generally the most exposed to
a variety of chemical contaminants (Ref. 13, p. 6).


6. Decomposition


Finfish are generally regarded as being much more perishable than terrestrial flesh foods (Ref. 14, p. 3). Decomposition
is a problem with seafood products frequently encountered by FDA and is the subject of the majority of regulatory actions
taken by the agency against violative seafood products (Ref. 15). It is largely an economic and aesthetic problem;
however, in some species it can lead to illness because of the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) during decomposition.
Scombroid poisoning is completely preventable by proper handling, i.e., by proper time and temperature controls.


D. Additional Factors Affecting Safety


Unlike beef and poultry, seafood is still predominately a wild-caught flesh food that frequently must be harvested
under difficult conditions and at varying distances from processing, transport, and retail facilities. There are
nearly 100,000 vessels in the U.S. fishing fleet alone (Ref. 7, p. 22). These conditions, distances, and duration
of fishing trips, can tax any system of controls designed to ensure safety and prevent spoilage.
In addition, several hundred vessels are seagoing processing factories, many of which operate in remote waters.
For regulators, these ships that process at sea can be difficult and expensive to reach while they are operating, and
individual inspectors face hazards such as ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas.
There may be as many as 350 commercially marketed species (Refs. 16; and 19, p. 35). Consumer preferences for one species
over another and significant price differences between species can lead to economic fraud through the substitution
of cheaper species for more expensive ones.
Unlike beef and poultry, seafood is subject to significant recreational harvest. Beyond the 15 pounds of seafood
consumed per capita from commercial channels, an additional 4 pounds may be consumed from recreational sources.
Some recreational catch finds its way into commercial channels as well.
Thus, recreational fishing can have a bearing on the safety of commercial seafood. Commercial fishermen avoid or
are prohibited from harvesting from polluted areas, but recreational fishermen, especially recreational harvesters
of molluscan shellfish, might not be as aware of, or might ignore, local advisories or water closures. Processors
need to be aware of and control the source of their raw materials, and importers must ensure that their shipments are
obtained from acceptable sources.

An additional complicating factor in ensuring the safety of seafood is the fact that no other flesh food is imported
in the quantity, or from as many countries, as seafood. Imports include finished products as well as products to be
further processed domestically. Over 55 percent of seafood consumed in this country is imported. It comes from approximately
135 countries. Several of these countries have advance regulatory structures for seafood safety, but many others
are developing nations that lack structures for seafood regulation comparable to those in more developed nations
(Ref. 35, pp. 113 and 114).
Therefore, it is of utmost importance, that those who handle and process seafood commercially, including importers,
understand the hazards associated with this type of food, know which hazards are associated with the types of products
with which they are involved, and keep these hazards from occurring through a routine system of preventive controls.
The seafood industry, indeed, the food industry as a whole, must be primarily responsible for the safety and quality
of the food that it produces. The regulator's primary role should be to verify that the industry is meeting this responsibility
and to take remedial action when it is not. The alternative of relying solely on Government inspectors to identify
problems and provide solutions would involve enormous costs to the public and would be extremely inefficient, assuming
it could be done at all.
For the most part, seafood processors and importers are not required, through licensure or examination, to understand
seafood hazards as a prerequisite to being able to do business. (There are exceptions. A few States, such as Alaska,
do require processors to conform to HACCP as a condition of doing business (Ref. 17).) While many processors and importers
have such an understanding, this knowledge is not universal. It is not unusual for FDA to receive inquiries about safety
requirements and related matters from those who wish to process or import seafood, or who already do, that indicate
a lack of awareness of hazards specific to their products. Most of the industry does not have HACCP-trained personnel,
and many firms lack dedicated quality assurance personnel (Ref. 18, p. 35).
Seafood processing in the United States is done by several thousand businesses, many of which are small, old, and family
operated (Ref. 19, p. 35). This situation is in contrast to the beef and poultry industries, in which market share is
concentrated among a small number of large processors. Seafood firms tend to be small, fragmented operations sized
in reference to anticipated benefits, because of the significant, uncontrollable risks involved in this business
(Ref. 5, p. 225). Also, because many harvests are seasonal, many of their operations are intermittent (Ref. 20). The
seasonal nature of the industry can affect worker skills and practices relating to safety, while older facilities
and equipment can be more difficult to maintain in terms of adequate sanitation and proper processing and storage
temperatures (Ref. 20).

III. The Need for Regulations


A. The Current Inspection System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood


Seafood processors are subject to periodic, unannounced, mandatory inspection by FDA. Seafood processors and importers
are also able to purchase inspection services from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the U.S. Department
of Commerce. These inspection services have been primarily trade-related, such as grading.
Until recently, FDA's overall regulatory program for seafood received slightly over $20 million per year. Because
much of the program involves activities such as research, laboratory analyses, and technical assistance and training
to States, a substantial portion of it has tended to be invisible to the general public. Public interest and debate
tends to focus on the more visible aspects of regulation, primarily inspection. The congressional debate of the past
several years over the adequacy of the Federal regulatory program for seafood has been framed, more often than not,
in terms of the need for mandatory inspection. Traditionally, FDA inspected the equivalent of a quarter of its total
domestic inventory of seafood establishments per year.
Since 1990, however, FDA has received significant funding increases for seafood. The current budget of slightly
over $40 million has permitted the agency to increase the frequency of its inspections. It now inspects so-called
high risk processors at least once per year and all others at least biennially. (Because States also inspect processors,
the collective frequency is actually higher.)
Even so, because of seafood's unique characteristics (e.g., the fact that it is predominantly wild caught and presents
a wide range of possible hazards), it is questionable whether the current regulatory system, which was developed
for the general food supply, is best suited for the seafood industry. The current system provides the agency with a
``snapshot'' of conditions at a facility at the moment of the inspection. However, assumptions must be made about
conditions before and after that inspection on the basis of the ``snapshot,'' as well as about important factors beyond
the facility that have a bearing on the safety of the finished product. The reliability of these assumptions over the
intervals between inspections creates questions about the adequacy of the system, particularly, as the congressional
hearings on the subject over the past several years have shown, for seafood.
FDA's inspections are based upon the regulations on current good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, packing,
or holding human food at part 110 (21 CFR part 110). For the most part, these guidelines consist of broad statements
of general applicability to all food processing on sanitation, facilities, equipment and utensils, processes,
and controls. HACCP-type controls are listed as one of several options available to prevent food contamination ( 110.80(b)(13)(i))
but they are otherwise not integral to the guidelines.
Current Federal inspection and surveillance strategies verify the industry's knowledge of hazards and preventive
control measures largely by inference, i.e., whether a company's products are in fact adulterated, or whether conditions
in a plant are consistent with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). Consequently, the current system places
the burden on the Government to prove that a problem exists rather than on the firm to establish for itself, for the regulator,
and for consumers, that adequate controls exist to ensure safety. The current approach is inefficient and, unless
Government inspections are conducted with some frequency, can lead to conditions that can elevate risk and erode
public confidence. It also has the potential to cause some inequities. While the same standards of adulteration apply
to all products in interstate commerce, processors and importers who use a system of preventive controls coupled
with adequate monitoring must compete against those who do not.
A survey conducted by FDA in 1992-1993 of manufacturers of ready-to-eat seafood products revealed conditions
that strongly suggest the need for a system that emphasizes preventive controls to ensure that products are safe by
design. Ready-to-eat products require special care in processing because they do not require, and are unlikely to
receive, any further cooking by consumers that would destroy pathogenic microorganisms. The survey focused on whether
preventive controls exist rather than on the results of expensive end-product sampling. The agency found that, in
significant measure, firms have not been employing the types of preventive processing steps necessary to ensure
a safe and wholesome product. Some of the preliminary results are as follows (Ref. 21).
1. Fifty-four percent of the firms that pasteurized products had not established the adequacy of their pasteurization
process to destroy pathogenic microorganisms such as the spores of 

C. botulinum,

 type E, which can cause significant illness and death in humans. The pasteurization process is not simple and must
be done with precision in order to consistently deliver a thermal process that will inactivate the spores of 

C. botulinum,

 type E and prevent recontamination of the product after it has been heat treated. The CGMP at part 110 state that pasteurization
must be adequate. Realistically, the only way for FDA to determine, or at least infer, the adequacy of the process now
is to analyze samples of finished product for the presence of pathogens.
2. Twenty-seven percent of the firms that pasteurized products did not have temperature-indicating devices on their
pasteurizers, and 35 percent did not have temperature-recording devices. Temperature monitoring is essential
to ensure that a thermal process is properly controlled. Part 110 addresses temperature indicating and recording
devices only for refrigeration, while pasteurization involves cooking. A temperature-recording device is important
for purposes of preventive control because it provides a continuous history of the cooking step.

3. Forty-two percent of firms that pasteurized products did not perform can seam evaluations or performed them less
frequently than every 12 hours. Such evaluations are necessary to ensure that there will not be microbiological contamination
of the finished pasteurized product. FDA's regulations for the processing of low acid canned food (parts 108 and 113
(21 CFR parts 108 and 113)) require such evaluations every 4 hours as an HACCP-type control, but products that need
refrigeration (e.g., pasteurized products) are outside the scope of those regulations. Again, part 110 states only
that the pasteurization process should be adequate. FDA must conduct end-product sampling and analysis to determine,
or at least infer, whether a pasteurization process is adequate.

4. Forty-three percent of firms that pasteurized products did not perform cooling water sanitizer strength checks
to ensure that the pasteurized product would not be contaminated during this process. The presence of a sanitizer
in the cooling water is important to prevent contamination of the product after pasteurization because during cooling,
some water can be drawn into hot cans. Part 110 does not specifically mention a cooling water sanitizer. The ``adequate''
provision cited above is the closest relevant provision, and FDA must conduct end-product sampling and analysis
to determine, or at least infer, whether a pasteurization process is adequate.

5. Eighty-four percent of the firms did not monitor the internal temperature of products during the various stages
of processing. Such monitoring is important because time/temperature abuse can result in the growth of pathogenic
microorganisms, decomposition, and, in some cases, the formation of histamine. Part 110 states that all reasonable
precautions should be taken to prevent contamination and recommends temperature control as one type of precaution.
Again, end-product sampling is the only practical way for FDA to measure compliance.

6. Fourteen percent of the firms did not have temperature-indicating devices on their finished product coolers,
and 89 percent did not have temperature-recording devices. Part 110 states that processors should have one or the
other but does not specifically require that processors monitor either one. While 14 percent were out of compliance,
most who were in compliance opted for the control that did not provide a continuous record.

7. Thirty-one percent of the temperature-indicating devices on finished product coolers were more than 5 
 F out of adjustment. Fifty-five percent of these were giving readings that were too low. For these, the deviation
would permit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, decomposition, and histamine formation. Part 110 specifically
states that thermometers should be accurate. Five degree deviations are clearly out of compliance. A significant
percentage of firms surveyed were not paying attention to a significant preventive control.

8. Twenty-three percent of temperature-indicating devices on pasteurizers and 80 percent of such devices on finished
product coolers were never calibrated. Again, part 110 calls for accuracy. The failure to calibrate means that these
firms have no assurance that their devices are accurate. A preventive control is not being applied, and thus a significant
percentage of processors are apparently relying on Government investigators to determine accuracy during inspections.
Also, this deficiency may account in part for the deviations described in section III.A.7. of this document.

9. Twenty-nine percent of temperature-recording devices on finished product coolers were never checked for accuracy,
while 34 percent of such devices on pasteurizers and 74 percent on finished product coolers were checked less frequently
than once a month. Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred out of calibration and must be routinely adjusted
to agree with an accurate temperature-indicating device. Thus, they need to be checked for accuracy at least at the
start and the end of each processing day in order to determine whether they remained accurate throughout the day's
production.

10. Forty-eight percent of the firms cleaned and sanitized the processing equipment less frequently than every 4
hours, while 13 percent cleaned and sanitized less than every 12 hours. Part 110 states that sanitation practices
should occur as frequently as necessary. In order to control salmonella and other undesirable bacteria within a facility,
the frequency should be at least every 4 hours, and more frequently if feasible. This frequency helps reduce the likelihood
that these microorganisms will enter a rapid phase of growth during which their numbers increase logarithmically
(Ref. 22, p. 114; Ref. 23, p. 2).

11. Twenty-two percent of the firms did not perform plant or equipment sanitation audits (i.e., inspections), and
35 percent did not check the strength of hand or equipment sanitizing solutions. These results reveal that a significant
number of plants are not checking up on themselves to ensure that they were doing an adequate job of sanitation. In such
plants, the only check on sanitation is provided by the Government investigators who visit the plant.

Other survey and inspection findings by FDA and others strongly indicate that the seafood industry does not always
operate on the basis of preventive controls. For example, recent FDA and State surveys showed that many processors
of smoked and smoke-flavored fish are operating outside of the parameters that have been demonstrated through scientific
research to be necessary to ensure that the hazard from botulism is adequately controlled. These parameters are process
times and temperatures and salinity levels. A number of firms surveyed did not even know their own operating parameters,
let alone the scientifically established ones (Refs. 24, 25, and 26). For seafood products such as these that require
no cooking by the consumer, preventive measures by the processor to eliminate 

C. botulinum,

 type E to the maximum extent possible are critically important.

B. Alternatives Other Than HACCP 


Continuous visual inspection of seafood is not a viable 
alternative. Few hazards associated with seafood are detectable 
through visual inspection. Moreover, the costs of such a system 
would likely exceed the nearly half-billion-dollar public outlay 
now required to operate this kind of system for meat and poultry. 
Another alternative would be to direct significant 
additional resources toward greatly increasing the frequency of 
FDA's inspection of seafood, as well as increasing the agency's 
sampling, laboratory analysis, and related regulatory activities 
with respect to seafood. While thousands of samples of domestic 
and imported seafood products are collected each year for 
analysis in FDA laboratories, and these samples are 
scientifically designed to represent a broad range of products, 
they are generally perceived by the public to represent only a 
small fraction of the total poundage of seafood consumed in this 
country. Substantial new expenditures would be needed to 
increase laboratory analyses to nationally statistically 
significant levels. 
Even if the funds for increased inspection and increased 
sampling and analysis were available (which they are not), this 
approach alone would likely not be the best way for the agency to 
spend its money to protect the public health. Reliance on end-product testing involves a certain amount of inefficiency
that 
can require very large sample sizes to overcome. NAS recently 
observed that ``the statistical uncertainties associated with lot 
sampling make this an unreliable method for ensuring safety of 
food products * * *'' (Ref. 7, p. 283). FDA has traditionally 
sought to minimize this type of inefficiency by targeting its 
efforts based on its experiences, but some inefficiency is 
unavoidable. NAS recommended the HACCP system as an alternative 
(Ref. 7, p. 283). 


C. Current Import System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood 


Similar considerations apply to imports. FDA does not 
generally inspect processing facilities in other countries to 
determine whether seafood products are being prepared, packed, or 
held there under appropriate conditions. Such inspections are 
extremely costly and require an invitation from the foreign 
country. Traditionally, therefore, FDA's primary strategy for 
seafood imports has involved: (1) Reviewing all customs entries 
documents to determine which imported products to examine or 
sample; (2) conducting wharf examinations of selected products 
based on that review; and (3) sampling and laboratory analyses 
as appropriate. 
One concern about this process that has been voiced with 
some regularity in the media, Congress, and elsewhere is that FDA 
physically looks at less than 5 percent of all imports. This 
figure is somewhat misleading because it refers to seafood lots 
that can vary substantially in size. Also, it does not take into 
account such factors as the representative nature of the 
examinations, FDA's automatic detention program for imports that 
requires importers of products with a history of problems to 
obtain a laboratory analysis and certification prior to entry, or 
the fact that imports receiving further processing in the United 
States become subject to domestic inspection. Nonetheless, it is 
certainly true that most imported seafood is not physically 
sampled or examined by a Federal health official. 
The total number of customs entries for seafood each year is 
approaching 200,000 (Ref. 27) from about 135 countries (compared 
to about 33 countries for beef and poultry (Ref. 28)), and huge 
sums of money would be needed to enable FDA to increase its 
physical examination and sampling program to nationally, 
statistically significant levels. Still, many developing 
countries export seafood products to this country, and their 
regulatory protections tend to be comparatively weak, if they 
exist at all. Processing conditions in such countries do not 
always meet U.S. standards for sanitation. 
While many importers are conscientious about the safety and 
quality of the products that they import, others have little 
understanding of potential hazards. The denial of entry of a 
violative lot may be regarded as simply a cost of doing business, 
which is offset in many cases by insurance purchased against just 
such an eventuality. Such policies are identified as ```FDA 
rejection' insurance'' and usually the premium is 2 to 3 percent 
of the value of the shipment (Ref. 29). It is reasonable to 
assume that this cost is being passed on to the consumer. The 
insurance also permits importers to buy seafood from foreign 
processors without first ensuring that it meets FDA requirements, 
i.e., that it is safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. 

This system leaves much to be desired. It, too, is a 
``snapshot''-type approach that places a significant burden on the 
Government to uncover problems without fostering or promoting 
industry responsibility. It lacks the preventive controls that 
the agency has tentatively concluded are the minimum necessary to 
ensure safety. Moreover, it has not provided full public 
confidence in the safety of imported seafood. 


D. Public Confidence 


Continuing public concerns about the safety of seafood 
provide additional evidence that the current regulatory system is 
not well-suited for seafood. Consumers have become increasingly 
concerned about the effects of pollution on seafood. Medical 
wastes washing up on beaches, ocean dumping of toxic wastes, 
chemical run-off, and multiple oil spills continually dramatize 
the fact that bodies of water, no matter how large, can be 
adversely affected by human activity. 
Media and other public attention on seafood safety and 
quality, and on the adequacy of the current regulatory program 
for seafood, has been substantial in recent years, and there is 
no reason to expect that this attention will decrease. Problems 
with some seafood products draw attention to, and has tended to 
raise concerns about, all seafood, a situation that is bad for 
consumers because seafood is a low fat product, and bad for an 
industry that can ill afford it.

Several hearings on the sufficiency and direction of the Federal seafood safety program have been held in both houses
of Congress since in 1989. In addition, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress for the stated purpose of establishing
a Federal program of mandatory inspection of seafood. Different bills passed the House and the Senate in 1990 but were
not reconciled before the end of the 101st Congress. 

This legislative activity has tended to reinforce the view that the public is placed at some risk because no Federal
mandatory program for seafood exists. While this view is inaccurate in a number of respects, it is fueled in part by
the notable differences in the frequency with which regulatory agencies inspect the processors of different types
of flesh foods. As stated above, beef and poultry slaughterhouses are subject to continuous visual inspection under
programs operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

Public concerns about seafood regulation persist despite the recent increases in Federal resources and inspections
for seafood. A major U.S. newspaper recently published an article entitled ``A Sea of Uncertainties,'' which expressed
anxiety about the coverage of seafood inspection. ``The odds are,'' it observed, ``that the bit of fish you cook tonight
got to your table without ever being poked or prodded or even glanced at by a government inspector'' (Ref. 30). 

No realistic system, however, could possibly look at every piece of fish. Moreover, in the current budget climate,
improvements in the system for ensuring the safety of seafood will likely have to be qualitative rather than quantitative.
Estimated combined Federal, State, and local outlays for regulatory activities relating to seafood are about $100
million annually (Ref. 31), but pressures to cut back funding exist at all of these levels. 



IV. The HACCP Option




Thus, the Government must find new approaches to food safety that enable it to become more efficient and minimize costs
wherever possible. A new paradigm is needed for seafood inspection, one that provides an ongoing, scientifically
established system of intensive, preventive monitoring but that does not require undue resources. 

When faced with similar pressures, Canadian health authorities responsible for seafood safety came to the following
conclusion: 







One of the key challenges will be to endure the scrutiny of the informed consumer and demanding marketplace * * *.
The Canadian Government, as well as other western governments will be under constant pressure to limit spending as
the aging population places more and more demands on services and as the Federal deficit is addressed. This means inspection
programs cannot expect to have ever increasing resources to meet the challenges of the 1990's. Smarter and more cost
effective ways must be developed to carry out their mandate. 






(Ref. 32, p. 502.) 






The ``smarter and more cost effective way'' chosen by the Canadians is HACCP. 



A. What is HACCP? 



HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control. Its application to food production was pioneered by the Pillsbury
Company (Pillsbury) during that company's efforts in the early 1960's to create food for the U.S. space program. Pillsbury
concluded that then existing quality control techniques could not provide adequate assurance that the food being
produced was not contaminated. The end-product testing necessary to provide such assurance would be so extensive
that little food would be left for space flights. According to Howard E. Bauman: 







We concluded after extensive evaluation that the only way we could succeed would be to develop a preventive system.
This would require us to have control over the raw materials, process, environment, personnel, storage, and distribution
as early in the system as we possibly could. We felt certain that if we could establish this type of control, along with
appropriate record keeping, we should be able to produce * * * a product we could say was safe. For all
practical purposes, if this system was implemented correctly, there would be no testing of the finished packaged
product other than for monitoring purposes. 







(Ref. 33, p. 2.) 





In the succeeding years, the system devised by Pillsbury has been recognized worldwide as an effective system of controls.
The system has undergone considerable analysis, refinement, and testing. FDA believes that HACCP concepts have
matured to the point where they can be formally implemented for seafood on an industry wide basis. 

HACCP consists first of an identification of the likely hazards that could be presented by a specific product, followed
by the identification of the critical control points in a specific production process where a failure would likely
result in a hazard being created or allowed to persist. These critical control points are then systematically monitored,
and records are kept of that monitoring. Corrective actions are also documented. 

The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), which was established by USDA in
conjunction with FDA at the recommendation of NAS, has developed seven widely accepted HACCP principles that explain
this process in greater detail (Ref. 34). These HACCP principles follow.

1. Hazard Analysis 



The first step in the establishment of an HACCP system for a food process is the identification of the hazards associated
with the product. NACMCF defined a hazard as a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be
unsafe for consumption (Ref. 34, p. 186). The hazard analysis step should include an assessment of both the likelihood
that these hazards will occur and their severity if they do occur. It should also involve the establishment of preventive
measures to control them. To be addressed by the HACCP system, the hazards must be such, according to NACMCF, that their
prevention, elimination, or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of a safe food. Even factors
beyond the immediate control of the processor, such as how the food will be distributed and how it will be consumed,
must be considered because these factors could influence how it should be processed. Hazards that involve low risk
and that are not likely to occur need not be considered for purposes of HACCP.

NACMCF has developed numerous issues to be considered during hazard analysis. These issues relate to matters such
as ingredients, processing, distribution, and the ultimate intended use of the product. FDA urges seafood processors
and importers to become familiar with these issues. They include, for example, whether a food contains any sensitive
ingredients that may present microbiological hazards, chemical hazards, or physical hazards; whether sanitation
practices can affect the safety of the food that is being processed; and whether the finished food will be heated by
the consumer. For seafood, this analysis is particularly important because it is consumed raw or partially cooked
to an extent unrivaled for other flesh foods. Examples of seafoods that are consumed in this way include raw molluscan
shellfish, sushi, steamed clams, and cold smoked salmon.



2. Identify the Critical Control Points in the Process



Points in a manufacturing process that may be critical control points, as listed by the NACMCF, include cooking, chilling,
specific sanitation procedures, product formulation control, prevention of cross contamination, and certain
aspects of employee and environmental hygiene. For example, a cooking step that must be operated at a specific temperature
and for a specified time in order to destroy microbiological pathogens is a critical control point. Likewise, refrigeration
required to prevent hazardous microorganisms from multiplying or toxins from forming is a critical control point.



3. Establish Critical Limits for Preventive Measures Associated With Each Identified Critical Control Point 



In essence, this step involves establishing a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with
a critical control point. Critical limits can be thought of as boundaries of safety for each critical control point
and may be set for preventive measures such as temperature, time, physical dimensions, moisture level, water activity,
Ph, available chlorine, or sensory information such as texture, aroma, or visual appearance. Critical limits may
be derived from sources such as regulatory standards and guidelines, literature surveys, experimental studies,
and experts. 



4. Establish Procedures To Monitor Critical Control Points



Monitoring is a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a critical control point is under
control and to produce an accurate record for future use in verification. NACMCF identifies three main purposes for
monitoring: (1) It tracks the system's operation so that a trend toward a loss of control can be recognized, and corrective
action can be taken to bring the process back into control before a deviation occurs; (2) it indicates when loss of control
and a deviation has actually occurred, and corrective action must be taken; and (3) it provides written documentation
for use in verification of the HACCP plan. 






As NACMCF points out, continuous monitoring is possible with many types of physical and chemical methods. For example,
temperature and time for a scheduled thermal process can be recorded continuously on temperature-recording charts.
When it is not possible to monitor a critical limit on a continuous basis, monitoring intervals must be reliable enough
to permit the manufacturer to determine whether the hazard is under control. 


5. Establish the Corrective Action To Be Taken When Monitoring Shows That a Critical Limit Has Been Exceeded 


While the HACCP system is intended to prevent deviations in a planned process from occurring, perfection is rarely,
if ever, achievable. Thus, NACMCF states that there must be a corrective action plan in place to: (1) Determine the
disposition of any food that was produced when a deviation was occurring; (2) fix or correct the cause of noncompliance
to ensure that the critical control point is under control; and (3) maintain records of corrective actions. 


6. Establish Effective Recordkeeping Systems That Document the HACCP System 


This principle requires the preparation and maintenance of a written HACCP plan that sets out the hazards, critical
control points, and critical limits identified by the firm, as well as the monitoring, recordkeeping, and other procedures
that the firm intends to take to implement the plan. Secondly, this principle requires the maintenance of records
generated during the operation of the plan. 
Ultimately, it is the recordkeeping associated with HACCP procedures that makes the system work, both from the standpoint
of the HACCP operator (industry) and the regulator. One conclusion in a study of HACCP performed by the Department
of Commerce is that correcting problems without recordkeeping almost guarantees that problems will reoccur (Ref.
35, p. 85). The requirement to record events at critical control points on a regular basis ensures that preventive
monitoring is occurring in a systematic way.

7. Establish Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System Is 
Working 



This process involves: (1) Verifying that the critical 
limits are adequate to control the hazards; (2) ensuring that the 
HACCP plan is working properly, e.g., that it is being followed, 
and that appropriate decisions are being made about corrective 
actions; and (3) ensuring that there is documented, periodic 
revalidation of the plan to make sure that it is still relevant 
to raw materials as well as to conditions and processes in the 
plant. Government regulatory activities also help ensure that 
the HACCP system is working. 



B. Specific Applications to Seafood 



As NAS has pointed out, most health risks associated with 
seafood originate in the environment (Ref. 7, p. 1). Many of 
these risks are the subject of research by FDA, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department 
of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
others. This research is designed both to produce information 
that will provide a better understanding of the toxins, bacteria, 
chemical contaminants, and other phenomena and to provide a basis 
for developing more advanced types of controls for them. Within 
the limits of existing scientific knowledge, however, the 
industry can and should use HACCP to control the source and 
condition of raw materials based on an understanding of the 
likely hazards that need to be prevented. 

The Pillsbury team that first applied HACCP to food 
production began with a systematic review of raw materials to 
ensure that they were not bringing hazards into the plant. As 
Bauman pointed out: 




This required the development of a 
familiarity with the raw materials that was 
not a normal process in food product 
development * * *. The areas of concern 
ranged from the potential presence of 
pathogens, heavy metals, toxins, physical 
hazards and chemicals, to the type of 
treatments the ingredients might have 
received such as pesticide applications or a 
pasteurization step. (Ref. 33, pp. 2 and 3.) 

 


While all these areas that were of concern to Pillsbury are not 
germane to all seafoods, they certainly cover the range of 
hazards to which seafoods are susceptible. 

Of the three most frequently reported seafood-related 
illnesses, two are environmentally related: ciguatera in warm 
water reef fish, as described previously, and water-borne viruses 
in molluscan shellfish consumed raw and partially cooked. While 
a rapid test to detect ciguatoxin in fish continues to be the 
target of research at FDA and elsewhere, processors and importers 
can exercise control by ensuring that they are obtaining fish 
from responsible sources that are not harvesting from waters 
where ciguatoxin is being found. 

Ciguatera has been associated with recreational fishing. 
Processors and importers should address through HACCP any safety 
considerations that might exist with the commercial sale of 
recreational catch generally, depending upon species and locale. 

For viruses from molluscan shellfish to be controlled, HACCP 
measures must be in place to ensure that molluscan shellfish 
harvested from polluted waters are not entering commerce. Other 
key safety controls relate to proper refrigeration to keep 
potentially harmful microbes from reaching dangerous levels. 

The third seafood-related illness, scombroid poisoning, is 
caused by a toxin created as part of the process of decomposition 
after a fish has died. The formation of scombrotoxin can be 
triggered by time/temperature abuse anywhere in the commercial 
system and beyond, including as early as on the harvesting vessel 
if good handling controls are not followed. 

FDA is considering whether to develop good handling practice 
requirements (not necessarily HACCP) specific to fishing vessels 
and invites comment on this matter. FDA has traditionally 
refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels, largely 
because of the huge number of such vessels in the U.S. fleet, 
even though it has authority to do so. FDA invites comment on 
whether those boats that harvest scombrotoxin-forming species, or 
any other specific component of the fleet, should be subject to 
mandatory HACCP controls.

<TEXT>
 

Meanwhile, processors and importers of scombrotoxin-forming 
species can exercise HACCP controls aimed at ensuring that their 
incoming raw materials or imported shipments have not been 
time/temperature abused. Because any HACCP plans for such 
processors or importers would be clearly inadequate if 
scombrotoxin were not identified as a hazard and appropriate 
controls were not in place and systematically monitored, 
processors and importers should consider placing time/temperature 
requirements on vessel owners as a prerequisite to doing 
business. 

HACCP can also be applied to control of hazards from 
chemical contaminants, even though the full range of possible 
chemical hazards is still imperfectly understood. Government and 
academia have important roles to play in researching the 
toxicities of these chemicals, in monitoring them, and in 
performing various forms of risk assessment. In some cases, 
these efforts may result in the establishment of national maximum 
limits. In other cases, regional advisories may be more 
appropriate. The seafood industry has a responsibility to know 
whether chemical hazards are associated with the species they are 
handling, whether the occurrence of such hazards depends on 
harvest site or other factors, and whether a sampling and 
analysis program on their part would be appropriate. Processors 
and importers should monitor the origin of raw materials and 
imported shipments to ensure, for example, that harvest did not 
occur in locations subject to public health advisories. 

These are but a few examples of environmentally related 
hazards to which HACCP can be applied. HACCP controls can also 
ensure that hazards are not being created inside a processing 
facility through improper handling, cooking, or storing. 



C. Regulatory Considerations 



From a regulatory standpoint, inspections of processing 
facilities and of importers' plans and records would become more 
efficient and would be likely to have a much greater impact if 
HACCP controls were in place. A key feature of an inspection 
system tied to implementation of HACCP is access by Government 
investigators to the HACCP plan and to monitoring records kept 
under that plan. In contrast to the ``snapshot'' provided by 
current inspections, examination of HACCP records will enable an 
investigator to see how the processing facility or the importer 
operates over time. It will enable an investigator to determine 
whether problems have occurred, and how they were addressed. It 
will also enable an investigator to spot trends that could lead 
to problems, and thus to help prevent them from occurring. 
Additionally, it will enable the regulator to review the adequacy 
of the processor's or importer's preventive control system 
itself. Under such an inspection system, inadequate preventive 
controls would warrant remedial or regulatory action regardless 
of whether the processor's or importer's product is actually 
contaminated or unsafe. 

HACCP is not a zero risk system, however. Problems in food 
production and processing will still occur. HACCP systems are 
designed to detect and document those problems, so that they can 
be corrected as quickly as possible. Thus, regulatory action 
would not be warranted on the basis of the mere occurrence of 
processing problems. It would be warranted, though, if the HACCP 
system is not functioning properly to detect and correct the 
problems, or if adulterated food is allowed to enter into 
commerce.

<PARENT> FR940128-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An inspection program tied to mandatory industry adoption of the HACCP system would not be industry self-certification,
nor would it be deregulatory. An investigator under such a program would perform HACCP reviews but not to the exclusion
of other inspection activities. Thus, it is highly doubtful whether any falsification of records would go undetected.
Investigators are taught to recognize falsification of records, and the inspection techniques they use would likely
reveal any instances in which the records do not reflect actual conditions and practices. Falsification of records
carries strict penalties under Federal law. 
Unlike the other inspection options discussed previously that would involve continuous or high-frequency inspection
and commensurate costs, an inspection system tied to HACCP would not necessarily require an increase over current
inspection frequencies. Recordkeeping and record inspection will provide the inspector, however, with a broader
view. Moreover, to the extent that States adopt equivalent inspection programs in response to these proposed regulations,
the resultant network of consistent inspections would, in effect, increase the frequency of inspections at no additional
cost. The value to the nation of such a network would be substantial. 
FDA recognizes that many States are under considerable pressure to cut back funding in areas where a Federal presence
also exists. For seafood, however, FDA urges that the States maintain their programs, strengthen them to the extent
possible, and work with the agency to integrate them into a HACCP-based, Federal/State network. Such an approach
would be consistent with recommendations relating to the role of States made by NAS in its 1991 report on seafood safety
(Ref. 7, p. 16). FDA especially invites comment on how the proposed FDA program should mesh with an existing State HACCP
program for seafood, such as the program that exists in Alaska, so that inconsistent Federal and State HACCP requirements
are not imposed. 


V. The Proposal 


A. Decision To Propose To Make Use of HACCP Mandatory 


For the foregoing reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that a new system of regulatory controls for seafood is necessary,
and that HACCP is the appropriate system. Therefore, FDA is proposing to add part 123 to establish procedures for the
safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products. FDA is proposing these procedures under sections 402(a)(1),
402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1), 342(a)(4), and 371(a)),
in conjunction with section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 264). Section 402(a)(1) of
the act states that food is adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render
it injurious to health. Section 402(a)(4) of the act was included in the act to provide additional control over insanitary
and contaminated foods. (H.R. Rept. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d sess. 6 (1938).) Section 701(a) of the act authorizes
the agency to adopt regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. Section 361 of the PHS Act authorizes the
agency to adopt regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. 
The proposed regulations set out those requirements that the agency tentatively has concluded are the minimum necessary
to ensure that, to the extent possible, the processing and importation of fish and fishery products will not result
in a product that is injurious to health. These requirements include the establishment of HACCP preventive controls
that take into account the unique characteristics of seafood products. If a processor or an importer fails to adopt
and implement an HACCP plan that complies with the requirements that FDA is proposing, or otherwise fails to operate
in accordance with these proposed provisions, it will be preparing, packing, or holding the food under insanitary
conditions under which the food may be rendered injurious to health. Thus the food will be adulterated under section
402(a)(4) of the act and subject to regulatory action by FDA. The agency has reflected this fact in proposed  123.6(d).

FDA's tentative decision to adopt regulations that require the implementation of HACCP principles by the seafood
industry is grounded in the statutory objective of preventing food safety and sanitation problems. Section 402(a)(4)
of the act does not require that FDA demonstrate that food is actually hazardous or contaminated in order to deem the
food adulterated and to exclude it from commerce. Instead, under section 402(a)(4) of the act, food producers must
assure that the food is not ``prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it 

may have been

 contaminated with filth, or whereby it 

may have been

 rendered injurious to health.'' [emphasis added.] 
In enforcing section 402(a)(4) of the act, FDA has considered, among other things, prevailing industry standards
and the technical state-of-the-art in determining on a case-by-case basis whether the conditions under which a company
is processing or handling food satisfy section 402(a)(4) of the act. This proposed regulation would codify an appropriate
state-of-the-art means of assuring seafood safety and of preventing sanitation problems under FDA's authority
to promulgate regulations for the ``efficient enforcement'' of the act (section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a))).

The factual record that FDA has developed concerning the safety and sanitation issues posed by seafood illustrates
the need for codifying appropriate preventive methods consistent with the emerging technical state-of-the-art
and explains why FDA's initial focus in implementing HACCP is on seafood. Proof that any particular process or set
of manufacturing conditions in the production of seafood has in fact caused injuries or sanitation problems is not,
however, a legal prerequisite to this rule.

The proposed adoption of this rule is supported by several additional factors. First, as stated above, the application
of HACCP to the seafood industry has been the subject of a substantial amount of work, by the Federal government, some
States, academia, and the seafood industry itself, to develop specific HACCP models and otherwise to apply HACCP
to seafood processing and importation. The Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP) was conducted by NOAA at the
request of Congress in 1986 to design an inspection system for seafood consistent with HACCP principles. This project
resulted in the development of 16 regulatory models for specific seafood products that describe the basis for a mandatory
seafood inspection system. Each model applies many of the NACMCF principles described above in the context of a specific
product, such as breaded shrimp, raw fish, and molluscan shellfish (Ref. 35, pp. 67 to 73). 
The MSSP was conducted with significant industry involvement. The importance of industry participation in the development
of HACCP systems was stressed by NAS in its 1985 study of HACCP (Ref. 36, pp. 13, 309, and 310). As part of the MSSP project,
49 workshops were conducted involving 1,200 industry, State, and university participants. HACCP controls were
considered for economic fraud and plant sanitation/hygiene as well as for safety because economic fraud and sanitation
have been problems in the seafood industry. The MSSP models cover nearly all the types of seafood products consumed
in the United States except for low acid canned seafood, which is already subject to a mandatory HACCP control and inspection
system under the low acid canned food regulations adopted by FDA. 
Low acid canned seafood products represent about 25 percent of all seafoods consumed in the United States (Ref. 7,
p. 23). The regulatory system in place for them represents the first formal application of HACCP principles to food
by a regulatory agency. As with this proposal, the regulations for low acid canned foods were requested by industry,
and they were developed through cooperation between Government and industry. 
Although the low acid canned food regulations apply HACCP concepts to two hazards only, i.e., botulism in canned foods
and contamination because of poor container integrity, they are regarded as a major success and demonstrate the benefits
that HACCP can provide. Botulism in canned goods has been effectively controlled under the low acid canned food regulations
and is no longer a particular source of consumer concern. NAS recently concluded that canned fish is among the safest
of seafood items. (Ref. 7, p. 320). 
Seafood industry associations have been active in developing HACCP systems that their members could use. For the
past several years, the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) has been assisting firms in the northeast
to implement HACCP systems through Federal grants. NEFDA's activities include a pilot project for 15 processing
firms and participation in a retail seafood HACCP pilot (Ref. 18, p. 26). 
Academia has been active as well. For example, the Oregon Sea Grant, which services the Oregon marine community as
part of the national Sea Grant extension service, has issued a publication, ``Hazard Analysis & Critical Control
Point Applications to the Seafood Industry'' (Ref. 37). This publication explains the fundamentals of HACCP, inventories
microbial hazards of seafoods, and describes model HACCP systems for specific types of seafood processing operations.

As a result of efforts like these by Government, industry, and academia, a considerable amount of literature and expertise
now exist to facilitate the development of HACCP systems by seafood processors and importers, significantly more
than for most other major segments of the food industry. Given the advanced state of knowledge about the application
of HACCP to the seafood industry, FDA is proposing to make the use of HACCP mandatory for the seafood industry to ensure
that there is compliance with section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act. 
Second, seafood industry representatives have been urging the Federal Government to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based
system for years. The National Fisheries Institute, the largest seafood industry trade association, and others
from the seafood industry testified repeatedly at congressional hearings from 1989 through 1992 in support of legislation
that would mandate such a system. 
Indeed, nearly all of the seafood bills introduced in the Congress since the late 1980's, including the bills that
passed both chambers in 1990, contained HACCP elements. While there were different views on the merits of these legislative
proposals, virtually all Government agencies, both Federal and State, that testified on these proposals_as well
as most other witnesses_expressed support for the HACCP concept as it applies to seafood. The Chairman of the Interstate
Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC), an organization of States, Federal agencies, and industry that considers
issues relating to molluscan shellfish safety, testified that a HACCP-type approach is now being used for aspects
of the shellfish program and endorsed HACCP for all seafood. 
Significant elements of the seafood industry continue to press for the Federal Government to institute a HACCP-based
program. An article in a 1992 edition of a seafood trade publication on the advantages of HACCP concluded: ``With the
seafood industry under a continuing barrage of negative press regarding the wholesomeness and safety of product,
the industry is impatient to get started with a seafood inspection program that will reassure consumers * * *''
(Ref. 19, p. 39). 
In February, 1993, the Executive Vice President of the National Fisheries Institute wrote to the Secretary of Health
and Human Services asking that she ``initiate a state-of-the-art program for seafood which would be of significant
benefit to consumers * * *. HACCP-based regulation is very feasible for the seafood industry * * *. There is no reason
to wait for congressional action to put this modern technology in place'' (Ref. 38). As recently as April, 1993, the
President of the Pacific Seafood Processors wrote to FDA expressing support for a mandatory seafood HACCP program
(Ref. 39). The members of that organization process the majority of domestically harvested seafood. These requests
provide further evidence of the appropriateness of this proposal.

B. Preparing for HACCP 


FDA recognizes that this proposal involves a significant 
departure from current practices for most processors and 
importers and intends to work cooperatively with the industry in 
the establishment of this proposed system. The agency's 
experiences under both its HACCP-based low acid canned food 
regulations and the HACCP-based pilot programs for seafood that 
it conducted with NOAA in 1991 demonstrate the need for 
cooperation and technical support between the agency and the 
industry in order to establish HACCP and to make it work. 
The FDA/NOAA joint pilot programs involved the development 
and implementation of HACCP-based systems by seafood processors 
and HACCP-based inspections by the two agencies. Even though the 
FDA/NOAA pilots involved highly motivated seafood firms that 
volunteered to adopt HACCP, the firms found it difficult 
initially to identify hazards and critical control points 
associated with their own products and processes (Ref. 40). As 
both the agencies and the firms discovered, HACCP involved new 
ways of thinking and behaving that were not readily understood or 
implemented. A considerable amount of consultation and 
assistance between the firms and the Government proved to be 
extremely helpful. 
This experience reinforces the view that regulations that 
impose a HACCP-based system are needed for the seafood industry 
and thus represents a third factor supporting the appropriateness 
of this proposal. The systematic kind of preventive thinking 
that HACCP requires is not universal, but it can be adopted. 
Regulations will ensure that processors and importers do so. 
Significantly, once participants in the pilot programs made the 
transition to HACCP, they were able to identify benefits from 
using HACCP to themselves and to consumers in terms of product 
safety and quality, as well as plant sanitation and organization 
(Ref. 40). 


VI. International Trade 


Although not a public health issue, international trade is 
also a major consideration in determining the advisability and 
benefits of a new system of seafood regulation and therefore will 
be addressed here. It is estimated that close to 40 percent of 
the fish and shellfish harvested from the world's oceans, lakes, 
and other bodies of water entered international trade in 1991 
(Ref. 41). This movement reflects the need to match supplies 
with demand. Nations often have species in their waters for 
which there is little or no demand among their consumers, while 
consumers in other countries may prefer these species. In 
addition, sometimes foreign markets are willing to pay higher 
prices than domestic markets. 
Participation in the international trade in seafood is 
critical to U.S. consumers and industry. Approximately 55 
percent of the U.S. supply of edible seafood is imported. In 
1991, 3,014,819,000 pounds were imported, worth $5,617,887,000, 
making the United States the world's second largest seafood 
importing nation (Ref. 42).

<DOCNO> FR940128-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940128-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At the same time, the United States is the world's largest 
exporter of fishery products. In 1991, the United States 
exported more than $3 billion worth of seafood, making a 
significant positive contribution to this country's balance of 
payments as well as to the many coastal State economies in which 
these products are produced (Refs. 42 and 43). Our largest 
market is Japan, followed by the European Community (EC) and 
Canada. Both Canada and the EC have implemented or are in the 
process of implementing mandatory HACCP-based seafood inspection 
systems (Refs. 32 and 44). 
Given the significance of both international and domestic 
trade, ongoing efforts to harmonize or make equivalent country 
inspection systems and requirements takes on great significance. 
The current multilateral round of trade negotiations under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has resulted in 
further focus on this area. The draft text on sanitary and 
phytosanitary measures acknowledges the desire of the contracting 
parties, including the United States, to support ``the use of 
harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures between 
contracting parties, on the basis of international standards, 
guidelines, and recommendations developed by the relevant 
international organizations including the Codex Alimentarious 
Commission * * *'' (Ref. 45, p. L.35). This move toward 
harmonization, coupled with the current recommendations of the 
Codex Committee on Food Hygiene encouraging the international use 
of the HACCP system (Ref. 46), clearly argue for the adoption of 
this approach in the United States for seafood. Failure by the 
United States to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system 
may ultimately undermine its export success, with considerable 
economic consequences. For example, in addition to the EC, 
Canada, Iceland, Australia, and many other fishing nations have 
moved to a mandatory HACCP approach that could affect United 
States competitiveness in the major seafood markets. 
The EC is the United States' second largest export market, 
purchasing $441 million worth of U.S. products in 1991. On July 
22, 1991, EC Council Directive 91/493 was issued to set out the 
conditions for the production and placing on the EC market fish 
and fishery products (Ref. 44). This Directive requires, as of 
January 1, 1993, that both member States and third countries:

 

* * * take all necessary measures so that, at 
all stages of the production of fishery 
products * * * persons responsible must carry 
out their own checks based on the following 
principles: 



_Identification of critical control 
points in their establishments on the basis 
of the manufacturing processes used; 
_establishment and implementation of 
methods for monitoring and checking such 
critical control points; * * * 
_keeping a written record * * * with 
a view to submitting them to the competent 
authority * * *.

 

While the directive provides some flexibility in terms of 
equivalence, it is clear that the EC is looking for a mandatory 
HACCP system along the lines proposed in this regulation. 
Maintaining and expanding this export market is likely to be 
facilitated if this proposal is adopted. 
Similarly, ongoing discussions with Canada under the terms 
of section 708 of the U.S./Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to 
harmonize or make equivalent the two nations' respective 
inspection systems and standards have made it clear that this 
proposed HACCP regulation will significantly facilitate the 
process (Ref. 47). Canada has recently completed implementation 
of a mandatory, HACCP-based seafood inspection program. Because 
Canada is the United States' third largest export market and 
largest supplier of imported seafood, adoption of an equivalent 
system would not only achieve the objectives of the FTA but 
potentially would save resources currently devoted to monitoring 
shipments between our two countries. Similar potential benefits 
could be expected under the proposed North American FTA, 
particularly at this formative stage in that process. Thus, 
facilitation of international trade is a fourth factor supporting 
the appropriateness, and thus providing a rational basis, for 
FDA's proposed course of action.

VII. The Proposed Regulations



These proposed regulations consist of a subpart of general 
applicability (subpart A) and one subpart that sets forth 
specific additional provisions for raw molluscan shellfish 
(subpart C). The agency is also setting forth guidelines, in the 
form of appendices, that will provide assistance to processors of 
cooked, ready-to-eat products (Appendix A), and to processors of 
scombrotoxin forming species (Appendix B), on how to meet various 
requirements in subpart A relating to the development and 
implementation of HACCP plans. The products addressed in the 
guidelines involve special considerations or special hazards for 
which additional guidance would be useful. Processors and 
importers that follow these guidelines will increase the 
likelihood that FDA will find their preventive controls 
acceptable. FDA requests comments on the need for, and the 
substance of, the guidelines that it has set forth. Comments 
should address whether it would be more appropriate for FDA to 
adopt the guidelines as regulations. If the comments provide a 
convincing basis for doing so, FDA will include some or all of 
the guidelines in the regulations in any final rule that results 
from this rulemaking. 
FDA is also including a guideline on how to ensure product 
integrity relating to economic adulteration (Appendix D). FDA is 
including this guideline because economic adulteration is a 
particular problem in the seafood industry. 
In Appendix 1 to this document, FDA is also providing 
samples from a package of general guidance, to be published 
separately, for processors to use in understanding and 
implementing HACCP principles in their operations. One of these 
samples is specific guidance on the processing of smoked and 
smoke-flavored fish. FDA requests comments on whether the latter 
guidance should remain as such, be provided as guidelines in an 
appendix to the regulations, or be made mandatory by 
incorporating them into any final rule that results from this 
proceeding. 


A. Definitions 


The agency is relying generally on the definitions contained 
in the act, in the umbrella good manufacturing practice 
guidelines in part 110, and in other agency regulations. The 
agency is using these definitions because it considers 
consistency in how it uses terms in its regulations to be 
necessary and appropriate. Thus,  123.3(o) is derived from 
 113.3(s), and  123.3(r) is derived from  110.3(q). 
Additional definitions are proposed in  123.3 that are specific 
to the proposed HACCP program for fish and fishery products.

<TEXT>
 

The agency is proposing to define ``certification number'' in  123.3(a) as a unique combination of letters
and numbers assigned to a shellfish processor by a shellfish control authority, usually the State. These numbers
are used to identify the processor on tags and labels and in recordkeeping required under proposed  123.28.
States issue certification numbers to processors who receive shellfish from safe sources, keep requisite records
of shellfish purchases and sales, and operate in accordance with CGMP and the other certification requirements of
the State. This system of State issued numbers is used to identify the approximately 2,000 State certified shellfish
dealers that are included on the Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List. 

The agency is proposing in  123.3(b) to define ``cooked, ready-to-eat fishery product'' as a fishery product
that is subjected by a commercial processor to either a cooking process before being placed in a final container, or
to pasteurization in the final container, or to both. Cooked, ready-to-eat products undergo a heat treatment by a
processor that results in the coagulation of the protein. Because their organoleptic qualities suggest that they
are fully cooked, and thus ready-to-eat, these products will likely be eaten without any further heat treatment by
the consumer sufficient to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and preformed toxins. 

As defined, cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products include products that must be stored either frozen or refrigerated.
Products such as canned seafoods that are subjected to a cooking process after being placed in a final container, while
technically considered cooked, ready-to-eat products, are not included in the definition because they are virtually
sterile in the final container. As used in these proposed regulations, the term applies to cooked, ready-to-eat products
that do not receive a heat treatment in the final container by the processor sufficient to destroy all pathogens and
create a shelf-stable product that does not need refrigeration. 

The agency is proposing in  123.3(c) to define ``critical control point'' for purposes of these regulations
as a point in a food process where there is a high probability that improper control may cause, allow, or contribute
to a hazard in the final food. This is a modification of the definition of the same term in  110.3(e). Under that
definition, a ``critical control point'' is a point where an improper control could cause, allow, or contribute to
``filth in the final food or decomposition in the final food'' as well as to a ``hazard'' in the final food. Clearly,
that definition is intended to apply both to human food safety and to certain quality issues that would not normally
cause illness. In this document, FDA is proposing to require the identification of critical control points for safety
only and is encouraging, but not requiring, the identification of certain critical control points for hazards not
normally related to safety. The modification of the part 110 definition being proposed here represents the least
revision necessary to achieve that purpose. 

The agency is proposing to define ``critical limit'' in  123.3(d) as a maximum or minimum value to which a physical,
biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to minimize the risk of occurrence
of the identified hazard. This definition is consistent with that of NACMCF, which defined ``critical limit'' as
``a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with a critical control point'' (Ref. 34, p.
186), but FDA's proposed definition is somewhat more explanatory. Critical limits can be either maximum values,
such as the maximum amount of histamine that can be allowed in a fish, or minimum values, such as the minimum temperature
needed during a cooking step to kill pathogens. 

The proposed definition states that control is for the purpose of minimizing risk. While complete prevention of a
hazard is obviously the most desirable of all possible outcomes, the proposed definition recognizes that, in reality,
complete prevention cannot always be ensured. A processor can minimize a microbiological hazard with a cooked, ready-to-eat
product by proper cooking, but the hazard could still occur if the product is contaminated or otherwise abused elsewhere
in the distribution system or in the home. This aspect of the definition is consistent with the view of NACMCF, which
states that: ``Each CCP [critical control point] will have one or more preventive measures that must be properly controlled
to assure prevention, elimination or reduction of hazards to acceptable levels'' (Ref. 34, p. 196). 

The agency is proposing in  123.3(e) to define ``fish'' and broadly to encompass the range of seafood products
that are processed or marketed commercially in the United States. Thus, the term ``fish'' includes all fresh or saltwater
finfish, molluscan shellfish, crustaceans, and other forms of aquatic animal life. Birds are specifically excluded
from the definition because commercial species of birds are either nonaquatic or, as in the case of aquatic birds such
as ducks, regulated by USDA. Mammals are also specifically excluded because no aquatic mammals are processed or marketed
commercially in this country. 

``Fishery products'' in proposed  123.3(f) are any edible human food product derived in whole or in part from
fish, including fish that has been processed in any manner. This definition reflects the tentative conclusion of
the agency to propose mandatory HACCP requirements at this time to control hazards associated with processing and
importing seafood products intended for human consumption. The proposed definition includes products that contain
ingredients other than seafood in keeping with the scope of FDA's regulatory authority. The control of hazards is
as important for products that contain ingredients other than fish as it is for products consisting of fish alone.

The agency is proposing in  123.3(g) to define ``harvester'' 
as a person who commercially takes molluscan shellfish from their 
growing waters, by any means. Harvester is defined because, 
under this proposal, this person has responsibility for tagging 
the product as to where it was harvested and when. Harvesters 
are expected to have an identification number issued by a 
shellfish control authority. Harvesting is generally illegal 
without such a number. 

The agency is proposing to define the term ``importer'' in 
 123.3(h) as the owner of the imported goods or his 
representative in the United States. This is the person who is 
responsible for ensuring goods being entered are in compliance 
with all laws affecting the importation. Importers may not 
always directly handle the imported food, but they are 
responsible for the safety and wholesomeness of products they 
offer for entry into the United States and therefore are subject 
to part 123. 

The agency recognizes that the term ``importer'' is often used 
to describe not only the owner of the goods or his representative 
in the United States (that is, the importer of record) but also 
includes freight forwarders, food brokers, food jobbers, 
carriers, and steamship representatives. These other agents 
often represent the importer for legal and financial purposes 
that are not necessarily related to the safety of the product. 
Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that it is 
inappropriate to focus the HACCP requirements that bear on 
imports on these persons if they do not have authority to make 
decisions affecting the product's safety or wholesomeness. 

FDA is proposing to define a ``lot of molluscan shellfish'' in 
 123.3(i) as no more than one day's harvest from a single, 
defined growing area, by one or more harvesters. This definition 
establishes the quantity of shellfish that represents a single 
lot for tagging or labeling purposes. Lot distinctions are 
needed to differentiate shellfish harvested from different 
growing areas or at different times. The time limit of one day 
is imposed because the safety of a harvesting area can change 
daily as the result of rainfall, tides, winds, and other events 
that can bring contaminants into the area. The ultimate safety 
of raw molluscan shellfish is contingent on the water quality of 
the harvesting area. To ensure product safety, shellfish 
harvesting areas that are subject to appropriate state control 
are closed to harvesting within 24 hours of a finding of adverse 
conditions. The lot definition, coupled with the harvest date on 
the harvesting tag, provides evidence that the shellfish were 
harvested when the area was safe and open for harvesting. 

The agency is proposing in  123.3(j) that ``molluscan 
shellfish'' means any edible species, or edible portion of fresh 
or frozen oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops, except were the 
scallop product consists entirely of the shucked adductor mussel. 
The distinction between molluscan shellfish and crustacean 
shellfish, which include crabs, shrimp, and lobsters, is made 
because molluscan shellfish are commonly eaten whole and raw, 
while crustacean shellfish are not. The safety of molluscan 
shellfish therefore reflects the quality of the waters from which 
they are harvested and requires special public health controls. 
Furthermore, the agency is proposing to amend the definition of 
``shellfish'' in  1240.3(p) (21 CFR 1240.3(p)) to make it 
consistent with the proposed definition in  123.3(j). 
The agency is proposing to amend the term ``shellfish'' in 
 1240.3(p) to read ``molluscan shellfish'' to make the terms 
consistent between parts 123 and 1240. Because the term 
shellfish in its common usage, i.e., an edible mollusk or 
crustacean, includes crabs and lobsters, the agency believes that 
it is necessary to be more specific and accurate in its 
definition and consequent application of the requirements in its 
regulations. The proposed requirements for tagging do not apply 
to crabs and lobsters or to scallops when the final product is 
the shucked adductor muscle only. The agency is proposing to 
expand the definition in  1240.3(p) to include scallops to make 
it consistent with the definitions in proposed part 123 and with 
requirements under NSSP. 

The agency is proposing to define ``potable water'' in 
 123.3(k) as water that meets EPA's primary drinking water 
regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 141. Those regulations 
provide limits for certain microbiological, chemical, physical, 
and radiological contaminants that can render water unsafe for 
human consumption. 

The proposed definition is slightly different from the 
definition of ``potable water'' in   1240.3(k) and 1250.3(j) (21 
CFR 1250.3(j). That definition also references the regulations 
of EPA in 40 CFR part 141 but further includes FDA sanitation 
requirements in 21 CFR parts 1240 and 1250. Those sanitation 
requirements apply to interstate travel conveyances that must 
take on water at watering points. Such requirements are not 
relevant to these proposed regulations and thus were not included 
in the proposed definition. 

FDA is proposing to define ``processing'' and ``processor'' in 
 123.3(m) and (n) broadly to ensure the safety of seafood 
through the application of HACCP principles throughout the 
seafood industry. The definition of ``processor'' is intended to 
include all seafood processors that handle products in interstate 
commerce, such as shuckers and other processors of raw molluscan 
shellfish, factory ships, packers, repackers, wholesalers, and warehouses. Those who process low acid canned foods
are also 
included, even though they are subject to the HACCP controls of 
part 113. Those controls are targeted toward a limited number of 
safety hazards. These proposed regulations require that 
processors apply HACCP controls to all likely safety hazards.

Consistent with the regulations at part 113, the proposed 
definition of ``processor'' also includes persons engaged in the 
production of foods that are to be used in market or consumer 
tests. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP controls are 
needed for such products because the hazards associated with them 
are no different from those that can affect other commercial 
products. 

There are, however, certain handlers of seafood that are not 
included in the coverage of the proposed definition. Fishing 
vessels that essentially only harvest are not covered by the 
proposed HACCP regulations. As explained earlier, FDA has 
traditionally refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels. 
The agency anticipates that the regulations being proposed here 
would affect vessels indirectly through processor and importer 
controls over raw materials and imported shipments, e.g., 
preventive controls such as the purchasing of raw materials only 
from fishing vessels that engage in proper sanitation and 
time/temperature practices and that harvest only from approved 
areas. 

Transportation companies that carry, but do not otherwise 
process, fish and fishery products are also outside the scope of 
the proposed definition, although the agency expects that 
transporters will be affected indirectly in the same manner as 
fishing vessels (see also  110.93). FDA invites comment on this 
aspect of the coverage of the proposed regulations. Proper 
refrigeration during transport is important for the safety of 
scombroid species products and of cooked, ready-to-eat products. 
Time and temperature conditions during shipment can also affect 
decomposition related to other factors bearing on seafood 
quality. These proposed regulations will affect transportation 
companies indirectly through the preventive controls the 
processor or importer will need to impose to ensure that the raw 
materials or imported shipments that it receives are free of 
relevant hazards and have been appropriately handled. FDA 
invites public discussion on whether this approach is adequate, 
and, if not, whether HACCP requirements should be applied 
directly to transportation companies. This issue is complex, 
especially because it is not unusual for transporters to deliver 
a variety of food products, including seafood, to several 
consignees during a single shipment. 

The agency has also tentatively decided to exclude retail 
establishments from the definition of ``processor.'' As with 
fishing vessels, FDA has traditionally exercised enforcement 
discretion with regard to retail establishments. The number of 
retail establishments in this country_literally in the hundreds 
of thousands_would totally overwhelm any rational Federal 
inspection system. FDA has traditionally provided training and 
other forms of technical assistance to States and local 
governments to inspect retail food establishments through the 
agency's retail Federal/State cooperative program. A major part 
of that cooperative program involves the development of model 
codes, some of which have been widely adopted by State and local 
governments. FDA is now consolidating those model codes into a 
single, updated food code for the retail sector. Appropriate 
HACCP-based controls are included to address seafood hazards at 
retail. Consequently, FDA will continue to operate through the 
Federal/State cooperative mechanism and has not included a retail 
component in proposed part 123. FDA requests comments on this 
tentative approach. 

States are strongly encouraged, however, to consider how the 
principles in these regulations could be applied to seafood at 
retail and to shift to HACCP-type inspection systems as 
appropriate. Because of the high perishability of fresh seafood 
and the sometimes lengthy and complex distribution chain, these 
products can have relatively short shelf lives by the time they 
reach fresh fish counters and restaurants. In addition, seafood 
can be subject at retail both to cross-contamination because of 
poor handling practices and to species substitution. 

Improper handling of seafood and other problems at retail 
have been documented in recent years. NAS has concluded that a 
significant number of reported acute health problems were likely 
linked to handling and preparation practices in food service 
establishments (Ref. 7, p. 27). The February, 1992 edition of 
Consumer Reports magazine reported on a number of such problems 
with regard to seafood that were observed in retail 
establishments. A number of studies have found lack of adequate 
temperature controls in retail facilities (Ref. 48, p. 75). 

The agency is proposing to define ``shellfish control 
authority'' in  123.3(p) as the government entity responsible for 
implementing a comprehensive shellfish sanitation program. The 
shellfish control authority, among other things, is responsible 
for classifying shellfish growing waters, performing inspections 
of shellfish processors, and issuing certification numbers to 
shellfish processors. FDA relies on recognized governmental 
public health and food control agencies, both domestic and 
foreign, to carry out these functions. 

The agency is proposing to define ``shellstock'' in  123.3(q) 
as meaning raw, in-shell molluscan shellfish. This specific 
product form designation is needed because the applicability of 
the tagging, labeling, and recordkeeping requirements proposed in 
 123.28(b) and (c) is determined by whether the product is 
shellstock or shucked product, respectively.

The agency is proposing to define ``shucked shellfish'' in 
 123.3(s) as meaning molluscan shellfish that have one or both 
shells removed. The labeling and recordkeeping requirements 
proposed in  123.28(c) apply to shucked shellfish. 
The agency is proposing to define ``tag'' in  123.3(t) as a 
record of harvesting information attached to a container of 
shellstock by the harvester or processor. Under proposed 
 1240.60(b), the tag or bill-of-lading will identify the 
processor, harvester, date of harvest, and State, including the 
specific location of harvest. Most shellfish-producing States 
and countries currently require that shellfish harvested in their 
waters bear documentation with such information. This 
information is the minimum necessary to permit ready 
identification of site and time of harvest of the shellfish. 
Because raw molluscan shellfish directly reflect the quality of 
the harvesting area, this information is necessary to provide 
assurance that the shellfish were harvested from an area that was 
safe and open for harvesting. 


B. Purpose and Criteria 


Section 123.5(a) of the proposed regulations references the 
umbrella CGMP guidelines in part 110 as providing general 
guidance with regard to such matters as facility design, 
materials, personnel practices, and cleaning and sanitation 
procedures. Because part 110 provides guidance of general 
applicability to all foods, the agency intends that this guidance 
will continue to be valid for seafood processors when the 
proposed regulations at part 123 are issued in final form. 
Proposed  123.5(b) makes clear that the purpose of subpart A of 
part 123 is to set forth requirements specific to the processing 
and importation of fish and fishery products. 


C. HACCP Plans 


1. Summary 


FDA is proposing to require in  123.6 that commercial 
processors and importers of fish and fishery products develop and 
implement HACCP plans in keeping with Principle 6 of the NACMCF 
discussed previously. Development and implementation of an HACCP 
plan requires that processors think through the entire process 
flow from raw materials to finished product shipping to ensure 
that safety hazards are controlled by design, and that they 
operate that process as a matter of daily routine. For 
importers, the thought process will begin with a decision from 
whom and from where to buy fishery products and follow through to 
arrangements for shipment to the United States, storage in the 
United States, and end when the product leaves the control of the 
importer. The plan provides the structure for the preventive 
controls, including the recordkeeping associated with those 
controls, that a processor or importer is to employ. 
In summary, FDA has tentatively concluded that the essential 
elements of this structure must include: (1) The identification 
of hazards to ensure that the processor or importer knows what 
the hazards are, so that it controls them by design rather than 
by chance (proposed  123.6(b)(1)); (2) the identification of 
critical control points to ensure that the processor or importer 
knows where to monitor to prevent or minimize the occurrence of 
the relevant hazard (proposed  123.6(b)(2)); (3) the 
identification of critical limits that must be met at each 
critical control point, so that the processor or importer has 
objective standards in place by which to determine whether it is 
controlling the relevant hazard (proposed  123.6(b)(3)); (4) 
the identification of procedures for how and when the processor 
or importer will monitor the critical control points to ensure 
both that monitoring is done as a matter of routine, and that it 
is done in an appropriate manner and with sufficient frequency to 
establish preventive control (proposed  123.6(b)(4)); and (5) a 
recordkeeping system for that monitoring that will establish for 
the processor's or importer's benefit that it is effectively 
implementing a system of preventive controls, and record how 
those controls are operating over time (proposed 
 123.6(b)(5)). 
The recordkeeping system is the key to HACCP. As explained 
above, the records will enable the processor or importer, and 
ultimately the regulator, to see the operations of the processor 
or importer through time, rather than only how they are 
functioning at a particular moment in time. Among other things, 
HACCP records can reveal trends that might otherwise go 
undetected until significant problems occurred.

All of these requirements reflect the HACCP principles 
developed by NACMCF. 
FDA is not proposing to require that the HACCP plan be 
signed by any official of a company, but invites comment on the 
merits of such a requirement in the final regulations as a means 
of both ensuring and demonstrating formal adoption of the plan by 
that company. FDA also invites comment on who in the firm would 
be the appropriate individual to sign the plan. 


2. Guidelines and Other Assistance 


FDA recognizes that HACCP plans will vary in complexity, 
from those having many critical control points, such as plans for 
multicomponent, ready-to-eat products, to those having only a few 
critical control points, such as a plan for a fish filleting 
plant. Plan development can be facilitated by technical 
assistance from many sources and by the detailed advice provided 
in the literature. NACMCF, for example, has recommended that, to 
facilitate the development of HACCP plans, processors should 
create an HACCP team, identify the intended use and likely 
consumers of the food, and prepare a flow diagram of the entire 
manufacturing process to help identify critical control points. 
The agency favors simplicity and the rapid development of 
HACCP plans without undue expense. The appendices at the end of 
the proposed regulations are intended to facilitate plan 
development by setting forth certain critical control points, 
critical limits, controls, and records that, if incorporated into 
or prepared under a HACCP plan, would be acceptable to the agency 
for the types of products mentioned. To further facilitate the 
development of HACCP plans, FDA intends to issue separate HACCP 
guidance for seafood that will provide information on hazards and 
appropriate controls by species and by product type. 
The guidance will provide a broad spectrum of information 
from which firms will be able to identify likely hazards and 
critical control points that apply to them. The agency believes 
that the number of critical control points will range, roughly, 
between 2 and 12 per product. 
The guidance will also contain a fill-in-the-blank type of 
HACCP plan with instructions on how to complete the plan based on 
information in the guidance. The agency has tentatively 
concluded that a plan that follows this model is likely to be 
acceptable to FDA. The agency is including samples of the 
guidance it is developing in Appendix 1 to this document. FDA 
intends to issue a separate draft guidance document for public 
comment and to make the completed guidance available to the 
public at the time that the regulations are finalized.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, seafood trade associations, university Sea 
Grant extension offices, and others have already developed work 
sheets and other aids to facilitate HACCP planning for seafood. 
Industry members are encouraged to contact their trade 
associations and state universities or Sea Grant extension 
offices on such matters. 




3. Effective Date 




Even with these forms of assistance, however, FDA recognizes 
that HACCP plans cannot be written and implemented overnight. As 
has already been discussed, the HACCP system of controls can 
involve new ways of thinking and performing on a routine basis. 
Consequently, FDA is proposing that these regulations will become 
effective 1 year after issuance of the final rule in this 
proceeding. The agency has tentatively concluded that this 
period of time is sufficient to permit the development and 
implementation of HACCP plans by the industry. FDA specifically 
invites comment on whether 1 year will be adequate. The agency's 
objective is to provide enough time to permit processors and 
importers to understand HACCP, analyze the relevant hazards, and 
develop an appropriate HACCP plan, but also to avoid unnecessary 
delay. 


After the proposed effective date, inspection of HACCP plans 
will occur as part of routine, mandatory plant inspections and 
import examinations. FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP 
plans be submitted to FDA in advance, or that preapproval by FDA 
be a condition of their adoption or implementation. FDA is not 
requiring preapproval for two reasons. First, HACCP plans can 
only properly be judged in the context of the facility itself. 
Thus, while FDA investigators will consider the adequacy of the 
plan during their inspections, preapproval does not seem 
warranted. Second, the agency simply does not have the resources 
to make preapproval a requirement. Given the protections that 
are built into the HACCP approach, FDA tentatively finds that 
preapproval is not necessary to ensure that fish and fishery 
products are not produced under conditions whereby they may be 
adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act. 




4. Location and Product Type 




FDA is proposing in  123.6(a) to require that every 
processor and importer have and implement an HACCP plan that is 
specific both to each location where that processor engages in 
processing and to each kind of fish and fishery product being 
processed. A plan should be specific to each location because 
the likely hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and 
monitoring procedures can vary from one facility to the next 
depending on such factors as type of equipment, conditions and 
procedures, and location. A plan also should be specific to each 
type of fish and fishery product for the same kinds of reasons. 
Hazards can vary depending on species, location of catch, and 
other factors. 


FDA does not intend, however, to require a processor or 
importer to write a separate plan, or separate part of a plan, 
for each fish and fishery product it handles if the likely 
hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and monitoring 
procedures are identical for each of them. For example, the 
preventive controls necessary to ensure safety for most deep 
water species of finfish from the north Atlantic may be virtually 
identical. The agency has tentatively concluded that, in such 
cases, a processor or importer may group the fish or fish 
products together in an HACCP plan. 




5. Safety Hazards Only 




FDA is proposing to require at  123.6(b)(1) that HACCP 
plans identify the human food safety hazards that must be 
controlled for each fish and fishery product being processed by a 
processor or importer. There exists a range of opinion on 
whether HACCP should apply solely to safety hazards, as this 
provision proposes to require, or whether HACCP should apply to 
other types of hazards, such as decomposition not normally 
associated with illness in humans. One school of thought holds 
that HACCP should apply to safety hazards only in order to keep 
it focused and to not overwhelm operators with an unnecessarily 
large number of critical control points that have no bearing on 
the primary concern of safety. Another view holds that, for 
seafood at least, HACCP-type controls can be applied to various 
consumer risks without generating an excessive number of critical 
control points. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene came to the 
latter conclusion (Ref. 46), as did NOAA as a result of its 
experiences during the MSSP (Ref. 35, p. 70). Partly for that 
reason, the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs involved HACCP controls 
for safety and HACCP-type controls for other hazards as well. 


For purposes of these proposed regulations, however, FDA's 
application of HACCP is intended for the efficient enforcement of 
section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act, which applies to 
products that contain substances that may render the product 
injurious to health and to processing conditions that are 
insanitary and that could render a product injurious to health. 
Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that HACCP plans 
include identification of hazards that could affect human food 
safety only. To facilitate the production of such plans, FDA has 
listed in proposed  123.6(b)(1) the types of hazards that have 
been associated with seafood (see section II.C. of this document 
for a discussion of these hazards). All of these hazards are 
identified and discussed in the NAS report on seafood safety 
(Ref. 7).

Processors and importers should identify in their written 
plans only those safety hazards that are reasonably likely to 
occur, rather than every conceivable hazard no matter how 
theoretical or remote. This view is in keeping with NACMCF's 
recommendation that firms conduct a hazard analysis and then give 
no further consideration to hazards that are unlikely to occur 
(Ref. 34, p. 189). FDA has tentatively concluded that processors 
and importers should not be required to establish controls and 
regularly monitor for hazards that are highly unlikely to occur 
in the absence of those controls. If, for example, chemical 
contaminants have never been found, or have only been found in 
amounts significantly below levels of public health concern in a 
species from a particular location, processors and importers need 
not identify chemical contaminants as a hazard that must be 
controlled for that fish. 


As indicated earlier in this preamble, FDA intends to issue 
a guidance document that will cover possible environmental and 
processing hazards for fish and fishery products as well as types 
of controls that can be applied to those hazards. The agency 
anticipates that it will update that guidance periodically as new 
controls (or new hazards) are identified or established. 


FDA cannot reasonably expect processors and importers to 
exercise controls for hazards that are beyond the scope of 
current scientific knowledge. The agency does expect processors 
and importers to demonstrate that they are taking precautions 
that are reasonable in light of available information, and that 
they are adopting new controls as those controls are developed 
and accepted. 


For example, the controls for 

Vibrio 

bacteria in raw 
molluscan shellfish, which can cause serious illness and death in 
certain at-risk populations, are the subject of continuing 
research at FDA and elsewhere. Short of a complete ban on 
harvesting, there is no known control that would prevent the 
presence of 

Vibrios 

in molluscan shellfish. Moreover, the 
infectious dose, that is, the number of 

Vibrios 

necessary to 
cause illness, is unknown. Because these bacteria occur 
naturally in the environment and are ubiquitous, controls that 
are employed to prevent sewage-related viruses from entering 
molluscan shellfish are not relevant to 

Vibrios. 

It is known, 
however, that proper temperature controls from the time of 
harvest onward can at least limit the growth of these bacteria 
(Ref. 49). FDA believes that such controls are reasonable and 
should be applied now. (In fact, temperature controls have long 
been a feature of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program 
(NSSP).) 


Of the hazards listed in proposed  123.6(b), pesticides and 
drug residues (proposed  123.6(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v)) are 
forms of chemical contaminants (proposed  123.6(b)(1)(iii)) but 
are listed separately because they can be of special concern in 
aquaculture-raised species. These fish generally have a greater 
likelihood of being exposed to agricultural run-off than wild 
ocean stocks (Ref. 50, pp. 11 and 12). Aquaculture-raised fish 
are known to be fed drugs for various purposes. Drug residues in 
edible tissues can be a public health concern. 


Decomposition, listed in proposed  123.6(b)(1)(vi), is a 
known hazard in those species that can generate scombrotoxin when 
they decompose; otherwise, it is regarded as a quality problem. 
Parasites (proposed  123.6(b)(1)(vii)) are not a hazard if 
killed during cooking but can be a hazard in finfish consumed 
raw, unless that fish is commercially frozen. Unapproved direct 
and indirect food and color additives (proposed 
 123.6(b)(1)(viii)) are a potential hazard with most any food.

6. Critical Control Points 


Consistent with the HACCP principles identified by NACMCF, 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.6(b)(2) that critical 
control points be identified for each of the hazards that the 
processor or importer has identified. Hazards may be caused by 
improper processing or by events outside the processor's or 
importer's direct control. To control the latter type of hazard, 
that is, environmental hazards and hazards that may be caused by 
poor handling prior to receipt of fish or fishery products by the 
processor or importer, the point of receipt by the processor or 
importer represents a critical control point. As indicated 
previously in this preamble, the processor or importer may need 
to ensure that it obtains imported shipments or raw materials 
only from harvesters, transporters, and others who can 
demonstrate that they also have exercised appropriate controls. 
The hazards that may be caused by both improper processing and 
events outside the plant are controlled by the critical limits, 
monitoring, control procedures, and recordkeeping that are done 
as part of HACCP. 


7. Critical Limits 


In  123.6(b)(3), consistent with NACMCF principles, FDA is 
proposing that processors and importers identify critical limits 
in the plan that must be met at each critical control point. 
Critical limits must be met to ensure that the relevant hazard is 
avoided. Thus, some critical limits can be set to reflect 
regulatory levels established by FDA in the form of action 
levels, regulatory limits, and tolerances for such contaminants 
as pesticides, histamine, and other contaminants. FDA intends to 
compile all such levels in the guidance document described 
earlier. 
Other critical limits can be set in consultation with 
outside experts, in keeping with the longstanding practice for 
low acid canned foods. For example, as explained later in this 
preamble with respect to cooked, ready-to-eat products, there 
exist a range of possible cooking time-temperature combinations 
that will deactivate pathogens during the cooking step, depending 
on the type of equipment being used by the processor and the size 
and species of fish being cooked. The existence of a range of 
effective cooking time-temperature combinations convinced FDA 
not to establish specific cooking time-temperatures for industry 
in the regulations for low acid canned foods. Rather, FDA 
decided to rely on outside experts and on research within the 
scientific community to establish cooking times and temperatures 
for these products. FDA is not proposing specific cooking time-temperature requirements for most seafood products
(although FDA 
is providing guidance on time, temperature, and salinity 
parameters for smoked and smoke-flavored fish, as is fully 
explained in Appendix 1 to this document) for the same reason. 


8. Monitoring and Control Procedures 


Proposed  123.6(b)(4) requires that the processor or 
importer identify in the HACCP plan the procedures that it will 
use to control and monitor each critical control point. 
Monitoring steps are necessary to ensure that the critical 
control point is in fact under control and to produce an accurate 
record of what has occurred at the critical control point (Ref. 
34, p. 197). Among the procedures that are to be used under 
proposed  123.6(b)(4) is monitoring of the consumer complaints 
received by the processor. While the goal of an HACCP system is 
to prevent all likely hazards from occurring, no system is 
foolproof. Consumer complaints may be the first alert that a 
processor has that deviations are occurring that are not being 
prevented or uncovered by the processor's HACCP controls. FDA 
has tentatively concluded, therefore, that each HACCP system 
should take advantage of consumer complaints as they relate to 
the operation of critical control points. 
Proposed  123.6(b)(4) also requires that procedures for 
controlling and monitoring critical control points must include 
calibration of process control instruments and validation of 
software for computer control systems, as appropriate. For a 
processor's preventive controls to work, the instruments and 
equipment that it relies upon in monitoring critical control 
points, such as thermometers, temperature-recording devices, and 
computer software, must be accurate and reliable. FDA has 
tentatively concluded that the best way to ensure such accuracy 
and reliability is to require that the processor's monitoring 
procedures include steps necessary to verify the reliability of 
these instruments and devices.

9. Recordkeeping 


As explained above, a HACCP system will not work unless 
records are generated during the operation of the HACCP plan, and 
these records are maintained and are available for review (see 
section IV.A.6. of this document). Thus, FDA is requiring in 
proposed  123.6(b)(5) that the HACCP plan provide for a 
recordkeeping system that will document the processor's or 
importer's monitoring of the critical control points. Proposed 
 123.6(b)(5) also requires that HACCP records contain the actual 
values obtained during monitoring, such as the actual 
temperatures and times. FDA has tentatively concluded that it is 
not possible for the processor to derive the full benefits of its 
HACCP system, nor is it possible for FDA to verify the operation 
of the system, without actual values. Notations that 
refrigeration temperatures are satisfactory or unsatisfactory, 
without recording the actual temperatures, are vague and subject 
to varying interpretation and thus will not ensure that 
preventive controls are working. Also, it is not possible to 
discern trends without actual values. 
In addition, proposed  123.6(b)(5) requires that HACCP 
records include the actual consumer complaints that may have been 
received by the processor or importer relating to the operation 
of critical control points or possible critical limit deviations. 
FDA has tentatively concluded that it may be necessary on 
occasion for it to review these complaints in order to be able to 
validate whether the firm is taking necessary steps to review 
controls and correct deviations as necessary in response to 
consumer complaints. 
It is not FDA's intent to gain unlimited access to 
industry's consumer complaint files through this proposal or to 
engage in ``fishing expeditions'' through consumer complaint files. 
Only those consumer complaints relating to the operation of the 
HACCP critical control points need be included as HACCP records. 
FDA's interest is solely in verifying that the HACCP system is 
working as it should. The agency understands the sensitivities 
associated with consumer complaint records and invites comments 
on this aspect of the proposal. 


10. Nonsafety Hazards 


Proposed  123.6(c) encourages, but does not require, 
processors and importers to include in their plans controls for 
hazards other than hazards to health. Examples listed in 
 123.6(c)(1)(i) and (ii) are decomposition not associated with 
human illness and economic adulteration. FDA is not requiring 
processors and importers to include nonsafety hazards in their 
HACCP plans for reasons stated previously. However, the agency 
is encouraging processors and importers to apply HACCP principles 
to these nonsafety hazards, and to control them in the same 
manner that processors and importers control safety hazards (see 
proposed  123.6(c)(2)), because they are common problems in the 
seafood industry. FDA has included a guideline on economic 
adulteration with these proposed regulations (see Appendix D). 
Despite the fact that these proposed regulations do not 
require HACCP controls for nonsafety hazards, such hazards as 
economic adulteration, decomposition not normally associated with 
human illness, general unfitness for food, and misbranding, 
constitute violations of the act and are subject to regulatory 
action by FDA (see sections 402(a)(3) and 403 of the act (21 
U.S.C. 343). Inspections by FDA investigators will continue 
to consider and enforce these provisions of the act.

D. Corrective Actions 


FDA is proposing in  123.7 to require that deviations from 
critical limits trigger a prescribed series of actions by a 
processor or importer, including determining the significance of 
the deviation, taking appropriate remedial action, and 
documenting the actions taken. This proposed provision is 
consistent with the HACCP principles enunciated by NACMCF (Ref. 
34). First, under proposed  123.7(a)(1), any critical limit 
deviation will require the segregation and holding of the 
affected product until the significance of the deviation can be 
determined. This step is necessary to ensure that products that 
may be injurious to health do not enter commerce until the impact 
of the deviation on safety has been determined, and the safety of 
the product assured. Second, under proposed  123.7(a)(2), the 
processor or importer must actually determine the effect of the 
deviation on safety, and third, under proposed  123.7(a)(3), it 
must take whatever corrective actions are necessary with respect 
to both the affected product and the critical control point at 
which the deviation occurred, based on that determination. 
Some deviations, especially if they are caught quickly, will 
not adversely affect safety. For example, if a refrigeration 
unit fails, but product being stored there is moved to a 
functioning unit before any appreciable warming of the product 
can occur, safety will not have been affected. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.7(a)(2) that the safety 
determination be made by an individual who has successfully 
completed training in HACCP principles (see proposed  123.9). 
FDA has tentatively concluded that this requirement is necessary 
to ensure that the person who is reviewing the significance of 
the deviation understands the possible consequences of a 
processing deviation and knows how to take appropriate measures 
in response to a deviation. FDA does not expect that a processor 
or importer will be able, without assistance, to determine the 
public health consequences of every possible deviation. The 
required training will, however, provide the processor or 
importer with information about when and how to obtain the 
assistance of an analytical laboratory, outside expert, State 
regulatory authority, or FDA district office in determining the 
proper course of action. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.7(a)(4) and (a)(5) that 
the processor or importer review the process and the HACCP plan 
to determine whether the deviation reveals the need to modify the 
process or the plan, or both, and to make such modifications as 
may be needed. It is critically important that a processor or 
importer learn as much as possible from the occurrence of a 
deviation and take steps to ensure that it will not be repeated. 
The plan should be a living document that the processor or 
importer should modify and update as circumstances warrant. 
These proposed requirements will ensure that the processor and 
importer connect day-to-day processing and other operations to 
the plan. Each modification is required to be noted, dated, and 
maintained as part of their HACCP records. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.7(b) that when a 
processor or importer receives a consumer complaint that may be 
related to the performance of a critical control point or that 
may reflect a critical limit deviation, it take appropriate steps 
to determine whether a deviation or other system failure has 
occurred that warrants remedial action and take such remedial 
action that appears to be warranted under  123.7(a). The 
importance of consumer complaints has been discussed above. 
FDA recognizes that segregation and holding of the affected 
product will not always be feasible or warranted in response to a 
consumer complaint. In many cases, there will be no product to 
hold because all of the product in question will already be in 
commerce. In other cases, a processor or importer may be able to 
determine very quickly whether a deviation has actually occurred. 
FDA is proposing in  123.7(c) to require that processors 
and importers clearly document all of the steps that they take in 
response to a critical limit deviation or a consumer complaint 
and include that documentation as part of their HACCP 
records. FDA has tentatively concluded that the processor, the 
importer, and FDA will benefit from this requirement. 
Documentation helps processors and importers to think the whole 
process through in a thorough and methodical way and to establish 
to their own satisfaction that they have taken proper steps. 
Documentation enables the regulatory agency to determine whether 
the processor or importer is able to regain control once a 
deviation occurs and to ensure that potentially unsafe products 
are being prevented from entering commerce or at least quickly 
removed from commerce. 
The documentation that FDA is proposing to require of the 
processor's or importer's response to the consumer complaints 
covered by  123.7(b) will enable the processor, the importer, 
and FDA reviewers to determine whether those consumer complaints 
are receiving appropriate attention in a timely manner. The 
documentation should be clear enough to allow a determination of 
the nature of the complaint and of the time it took from the 
receipt of the complaint for processor or importer to review it 
and to take any necessary corrective actions. FDA may choose on 
occasion to review a limited number of consumer complaints to 
match against the documentation maintained by the processor or 
the importer.

There is a strong view in the HACCP literature (see e.g., 
Ref. 51), which is reflected in one of NACMCF's seven principles 
listed above, that processors should actually have a plan 
describing how they will handle deviations, and that this plan 
should be part of the overall HACCP plan. FDA believes that 
there is merit in this view and encourages processors and 
importers to think through how they will handle deviations that 
may occur. The agency has tentatively concluded, however, that 
the proposed requirements in  123.7 represent the minimum 
requirements necessary to ensure that processors and importers 
respond effectively to deviations that could affect safety, and 
that given these provisions, it is not necessary to require that 
a specific plan be formulated and adopted. FDA requests comments 
on this tentative conclusion. 


E. Records 


As discussed above, maintenance of appropriate records is 
fundamental to the success of an HACCP system (see section 
IV.A.6. of this document). In recognition of this fact, FDA is 
proposing to require in  123.8 that HACCP records contain 
certain necessary information; that processors review records of 
monitoring and related activities before distributing the 
products to which the records pertain; that processors and 
importers retain records for specific periods of time; and that 
FDA investigators be given access to HACCP records. 
FDA is proposing in  123.8(a) that records involving 
observations or measurements during processing, corrective 
actions, and related activities, contain the identity of the 
product, product code, and date that the record was made. The 
purpose of this provision is to ensure that both the processor or 
importer and the regulator can readily link a record to a product 
and to the timeframe in which the product was manufactured. The 
linkage of the record to product is especially important when 
there has been a deviation at a critical control point. The 
agency has tentatively concluded that including the identity of 
the product, product code, and date of the activity that the 
record reflects provide the minimum necessary information to 
enable the processor or the importer and, ultimately, the 
regulator to determine what product may have been affected and to 
take appropriate action, such as withholding the product from 
distribution or recalling it from distribution. Dates also help 
discern trends over time. Even when no deviation has occurred, 
the information will enable both the processor and the regulator 
to identify factors that may help prevent problems in the future. 
In  123.8(a), FDA is also proposing to require that 
information be recorded at the time that it is observed, and that 
each record be signed by the operator or observer. It is 
important that information relating to observations be recorded 
immediately to ensure accuracy. The record should be signed by 
the individual who made the observation to ensure responsibility 
and accountability. Also, if there is a question about the 
record, a signature ensures that the source of the record will be 
known. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.8(b) that records 
receive a second review by an individual trained in accordance 
with  123.9, for verification purposes, before the product is 
distributed into commerce. The purpose of this review is to 
ensure that the processor or importer verifies that employees are 
recording data in HACCP records, and that deviations from 
critical limits are being caught before products that may have 
been affected can enter commerce. The agency is proposing to 
require that this records verification be performed by a trained 
individual to ensure that the records are reviewed by a person 
who understands the HACCP system, understands the significance of 
a processing deviation, and knows how to respond if a deviation 
occurs. 
FDA is proposing in  123.8(c) to require that HACCP records 
be retained for at least 1 year after they are prepared for 
refrigerated products and for at least 2 years after they are 
prepared for frozen or preserved (i.e., shelf-stable) products. 
These timeframes are based on the length of time that these 
products can be expected to be in commercial distribution (Ref. 
52; Ref. 53, pp. 72-73) plus a reasonable time thereafter to 
ensure that the records are there when the FDA inspector performs 
the next inspection. They are the same timeframes as now 
provided for in the Manual of Operations of the NSSP for the 
retention of records for raw molluscan shellfish.

<TEXT>
 

Similarly, FDA is also proposing to require in  123.8(c) 
that the processor retain any records relating to the general 
adequacy of the equipment or processes being used by the 
processor, including the results of scientific studies and 
evaluations to determine adequacy, for 1 year beyond the 
applicability of these records to refrigerated products being 
produced by the processor, and for 2 years beyond the 
applicability of the records to frozen or preserved products 
being produced by the processor. The processor may need to 
obtain a written scientific evaluation of a process, such as a 
cooking, pasteurization, or cooling process, to ensure that the 
process it is using is adequate to destroy pathogens or to 
prevent their growth. Such an evaluation may also be necessary 
to ensure the adequacy of the cooking, pasteurizing, or 
refrigerating equipment that the processor is using. (See the 
preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products.) 
As with processing records, these records should be retained for 
a period of time that reflects the period that the products to 
which they relate can be expected to be in commercial 
distribution. 

FDA recognizes that some processing plants may be closed on 
a seasonal basis. Given the nature of the HACCP system, however, 
FDA may choose to inspect at least the records of a plant even if 
the plant is not in operation. Therefore, FDA is providing in 
proposed  123.8(c) that if a processing facility is closed 
between seasonal packs, the records may be transferred to some 
reasonably accessible location during the period of closure. 

FDA is proposing to require in  123.8(d) that HACCP plans 
and records be available for review and copying by authorized 
agency employees at reasonable times. As already discussed, the 
agency's access to HACCP records is essential to ensure that the 
HACCP system is working, and that the safety of seafood is being 
ensured by design. FDA's authority to require maintenance of 
these records, and to provide for agency access to them, is fully 
supported by the holding in 

National Confectioners Association

 v. 


Califano,

 569 F.2d 694-95 (D.C. Cir. 1978). In this case, the 
court recognized FDA's authority to impose recordkeeping 
requirements on firms that process foods when such requirements 
effectuate the goals of the act. See also 

Toilet Goods 
Association

 v. 

Gardner,

 387 U.S. 158, 163-164 (1967). The 
importance of the records in ensuring that fish and fishery 
products will not be rendered injurious to health has been fully 
discussed. FDA access to these records will expedite the 
agency's efforts to ensure that the fish and fishery products in 
interstate commerce are not adulterated and to identify any such 
products that are. 

FDA is aware that there is substantial public interest in 
the extent to which industry-generated HACCP records could or 
should be publicly available. As FDA understands it, the 
argument in favor of availability is that where an inspection 
system to protect the public health relies heavily on records, 
those records should be public to the maximum extent possible. 
The arguments in favor of protection of records, on the other 
hand, are based on concerns about advantages to competitors from 
disclosure and on the risk that the records will be otherwise 
misused if they become public. FDA invites comment on the 
general question of public disclosure of HACCP records and on the 
agency's preliminary analysis of their availability, as follows. 

FDA has longstanding explicit statutory access to certain 
industry records during inspections involving infant formula, 
drugs, and devices and has access by regulation to certain 
processing records during inspections of low acid canned food 
processors. The agency has the right to copy and take possession 
of these records but does not routinely do so. FDA typically 
copies and takes possession of records only when they may be 
needed for regulatory purposes. As a preliminary matter, FDA 
expects to continue that practice with regard to seafood HACCP 
records. 

The public availability of those HACCP records that FDA 
would possess as a result of copying during an inspection would 
be governed by section 301(j) of the act and by the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) and regulations issued pursuant to it by 
the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and FDA. 
Section 301(j) of the act expressly prohibits FDA from disclosing 
trade secret information obtained during the course of an 
inspection. The FOIA regulations also say that FDA will not 
divulge either trade secret or commercial confidential 
information. As a preliminary matter, HACCP plans and monitoring 
records appear to fall within these two categories of protected 
records. As a consequence, FDA may well have little discretion 
in this area. Moreover, under DHHS' FOIA regulations, processors 
may be entitled to challenge in court a pending disclosure of 
records on the grounds that the records to be disclosed are 
commercial confidential or trade secret. 

As an additional matter, there are significant legal and 
practical questions as to whether FDA has the authority to 
require disclosure of industry records that are not in FDA's 
possession. As discussed elsewhere in this document, FDA does 
not contemplate the submission of HACCP plans or other records to 
FDA under these proposed regulations. The preapproval of HACCP 
plans by FDA (and thus the submission of HACCP plans to FDA) is 
simply not practical. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
HACCP plans and monitoring records will be reviewed on site by 
agency investigators as part of FDA's normal inspection regime.

FDA is proposing in  123.8(e) to exempt tags as defined in 
 123.3(t) from the recordkeeping requirements of  123.8. While 
the information on tags must be saved in accordance with the 
proposed requirements of this section and  123.28(d), the agency 
has tentatively concluded that it would be burdensome for 
processors to be required to retain the tags themselves for 
extended periods of time. NSSP now provides that processors are 
to retain tags for 90 days. 



F. Training 



Proposed  123.9 requires that each processor and importer 
employ at least one individual who has successfully completed a 
training course on the application of HACCP to fish and fishery 
products processing. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
training is critical to the successful implementation of HACCP 
systems in the seafood industry. Based on experience obtained 
during the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs in 1991-92, the agency 
believes that a significant portion of the seafood industry will 
be unprepared to meet the requirements of a mandatory HACCP 
program without some training. As discussed earlier, the pilot 
program revealed a general lack of understanding of the 
preventive nature of HACCP, including misunderstandings about how 
to establish critical limits, control measures, corrective 
actions, and recordkeeping procedures (Ref. 40). 

A similar concern that the industry did not understand the 
application of HACCP principles formed the basis for the training 
requirements in the agency's regulations for low acid canned 
foods. Improvements in canning operations can be attributed in 
significant measure to the success of the training programs that 
were established to implement that requirement (Ref. 54). NAS 
concluded that the successful application of HACCP principles to 
low acid canned foods was substantially the result of the 
training requirement in the regulations for those products (Ref. 
36, p. 309). The CGMP regulations for foods in part 110 also 
call for training in appropriate food protection principles ( 
110.10(c)). 

The often seasonal nature, remote location, and small size 
of many seafood processors also support the need for formalized 
training. All of these conditions result in difficulty 
recruiting highly qualified management and supervisory staff. 
Thus, FDA has tentatively concluded that proposed  123.9 is 
necessary to ensure that seafood processors and importers employ 
at least one person who is familiar with HACCP. 

These regulations propose to require at  123.9 that the 
person or persons at each importing and processing establishment 
who has received training be responsible for reviewing records of 
critical control point monitoring, recognizing critical limit 
deficiencies, and assessing the need for corrective actions 
relative to the product in question and the HACCP plan itself. 
While it is the intent of the agency to provide as much guidance 
as possible to assist processors and importers, these activities 
require specialized training in the principles of HACCP, various 
aspects of food science, and the criteria of existing regulations 
and guidelines. 

The agency anticipates that 2- or 3-day training sessions, 
modeled after the Better Process Control Schools currently in 
place for low acid canned food and acidified food 
manufacturers, will be provided by various public and semiprivate 
institutions. The uniformity of this training can be assured by 
a review of their contents and by periodic onsite monitoring by 
the agency. Thus, FDA is proposing to require that the program 
of instruction be approved by the agency. 

While 2- or 3-day courses may well become the norm, FDA 
invites comment on whether the training requirement could be 
satisfied by different gradations of training, depending on the 
complexity or size of the operation, or on the degree of risk 
posed by the product being produced, without compromising the 
purposes for which training is proposed to be required. For 
example, could training for a small business with few hazards be 
accomplished in a shorter time and at a lower cost through the 
use of a video? FDA also invites comment on whether training in 
HACCP received before these proposed regulations become effective 
as final regulations should be ``grandfathered'' as fulfilling the 
training requirement.

G. Sanitation Control Procedures 


1. General 


FDA is proposing to require in  123.10 that processors and 
importers that engage in processing perform sanitation 
inspections at specified frequencies and maintain sanitation 
control records that document the results and frequency of those 
inspections. If these regulations are adopted, the sanitation 
control records will be subject to the recordkeeping requirements 
in  123.8, including review by FDA investigators. 
For seafood, sanitary practices affect most directly the 
safety of those products that do not receive any further cooking 
by the consumer. These products include raw molluscan shellfish; 
finfish destined to be consumed as sushi; cooked, ready-to-eat 
products; and certain smoked and salted products. Both finfish 
and shellfish are regarded as microbiologically sensitive foods 
based on the potential presence of pathogens, notably 

L. 
monocytogenes

 (Ref. 55, pp. 31 and 32). 


L. monocytogenes

 is a pathogenic bacterium that is 
widespread in the environment. Thus, the likelihood of finding 
it on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. Since 
1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have been 
linked to contaminated foods. Although it is a relatively rare 
illness, the exceptionally high mortality rate among susceptible 
individuals makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne 
diseases in the United States. 
Numerous seafood products have been shown to support growth 
of 

L. monocytogenes

 (Refs. 56 and 57), and seafoods have been 
epidemiologically linked to two outbreaks and one sporadic case 
of listeriosis (Ref. 58). Furthermore, several cooked seafood 
products have been recalled from the market in North America 
because of contamination with 

L. monocytogenes

 (Ref. 27). Seven 
of nine smoked fish processing facilities recently inspected by 
FDA in New York State had 

L. monocytogenes

 in the environment or 
in the products (Ref. 59). 
Good sanitation practices are critical to the prevention of 
listeriosis and other microbiologically related foodborne 
illnesses. FDA's CGMP regulations for food in part 110 set out 
general principles of sanitation that should be followed in 
plants that manufacture, package, label, or hold human food. 
They address such matters as personal hygiene and cleanliness 
among workers who handle food, the suitability of the plant 
design to sanitary operations, and the cleaning of food-contact 
surfaces. FDA inspections of seafood processors apply the 
principles in part 110. 
Nearly half of the consumer complaints relating to seafood 
that FDA receives in a typical year are related to plant or food 
hygiene (Ref. 60). The reasons, while not entirely clear, appear 
to be related to factors such as the age of processing 
facilities, the seasonal nature of operations that affect 
training, and the turnover of personnel. 
A representative cross section of those FDA establishment 
inspection reports (EIR's) for domestic seafood manufacturers 
that revealed CGMP deficiencies for fiscal years 1988-90 
demonstrates this point (Ref. 61). The cross section involves 
795 EIR's covering 561 facilities. (The number of EIR's exceeds 
the number of facilities because followup visits were made to 
check on the status of corrective actions.) The following 
percentages refer to EIR's with deficiencies where at least some 
of the deficiencies involved sanitation: 
(1) Twenty-three percent documented receiving area 
facilities that were not clean/orderly or in good repair. 
(2) Twenty-six percent documented facilities lacking 
effective insect and rodent control measures in the receiving 
area. 
(3) Sixteen percent documented failure to handle ice in a 
sanitary manner and to protect it properly.

(4) Thirty-five percent documented lack of adequate 
cleaning or sanitizing of processing equipment. 
(5) Twenty-one percent documented processing equipment that 
was not constructed so that it could be easily cleaned and 
sanitized. 
(6) Eighteen percent documented processing equipment that 
was not made of suitable materials. 
(7) Fifteen percent documented hand sanitizers that were 
not kept at proper sanitizing levels. 
(8) Eighteen percent documented failure to have hand 
sanitizers available in the processing area. 
(9) Thirty percent documented processing areas that were 
not maintained in a clean and sanitary manner. 
(10) Forty-two percent documented processing areas with 
exterior openings that were not sealed/covered properly to 
prevent the entrance of pests or insects. 
(11) Sixteen percent documented waste material not being 
collected/covered in suitable containers or not being disposed of 
properly. 
(12) Twenty-three percent documented handling of finished 
product in a manner that did not preclude contamination. 
(13) Twenty-two percent documented employees not taking 
necessary precautions to avoid food contamination. 
During fiscal years 1991-92, FDA conducted abbreviated 
inspections of nearly all domestic manufacturers in its seafood 
establishment inventory. These inspections provide data on 
sanitation practices and conditions that are generally consistent 
with the above findings (Ref. 62). Examples of these data are: 
(1) Sixteen percent of firms had problems with the general 
sanitation condition of their processing areas. (This percentage 
is lower than for item 9 above because the universe is all firms, 
not just firms with deficiencies.) 
(2) Nineteen percent of firms did not clean and sanitize 
their processing areas or equipment throughout the day's 
production. (This matches most closely with item 4 above but is 
lower, presumably for the reason stated in the previously 
numbered paragraph.) 
(3) Twenty-eight percent of firms had employees that were 
not following proper sanitation practices in processing 
activities. (This figure does not precisely match any of the 
items listed above because the EIR's break employee practices 
down into specific categories, such as the wearing of hair nets. 
Some categories involve relatively minor matters, others are more 
significant. Findings with respect to these employee practices 
were not listed above for the sake of brevity.) 
(4) Twenty percent had employees that were not following 
proper sanitation practices for packaging and finished product 
storage. (The parenthetical observations in the previously 
numbered paragraph apply here as well.) 
(5) Thirty-six percent of firms either lacked hand 
sanitizers in their processing areas or had sanitizers that were 
not kept at proper sanitizing levels. (This finding is 
equivalent to a combination of items 7 and 8 above. 
Surprisingly, this finding is roughly the same as 7 and 8 added 
together, even though it includes all processors rather than 
processors with deficiencies.) 
Sanitation problems found by NMFS during the operation of 
its fee-for-service inspection program for seafood manufacturers, 
as described earlier, are generally consistent with FDA's 
findings. Entrants into the NMFS program undergo initial 
sanitation surveys by NMFS and are checked for sanitation 
practices thereafter. NMFS' data show significant sanitation 
deficiencies during the initial surveys (Ref. 35, p. 40). Some 
of the most common for 1989 include: 
(1) Sixty-four percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
to proper cleaning and sanitizing of product contact surfaces or 
equipment, containers, or utensils after use. 
(2) Fifty-one percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
to design, materials, or construction that prevented their being 
maintained in a sanitary manner. 
(3) Forty-five percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
to design of equipment, containers, and utensils so that they did 
not provide protection from contaminants and could not be readily 
cleaned and effectively sanitized. 
(4) Forty-three percent of plants had discrepancies 
relating to improper storage of equipment, litter, waste, uncut 
weeds, and grass.

(5) Forty percent had discrepancies relating to storage 
facilities that were not clean, sanitary, or in good repair. 


 For established participants in the NMFS program (as opposed 
to entrants), the percentages with discrepancies in the above 
areas for 1989 were: 49 percent; 47 percent; 25 percent; 49 
percent; and 33 percent (Ref. 35, p. 42). 


 FDA has tentatively concluded on the basis of all of these 
findings that HACCP-type controls for sanitation as proposed 
below are needed. The sanitation measures required under 
proposed  123.10 are fundamental to good sanitation practices 
and can have a bearing on human safety. The agency recognizes, 
however, that depending on the conditions in a facility, 
additional measures may be necessary (see, e.g., part 110). FDA 
will expect processors to include those measures in their 
sanitation practices but tentatively concludes that it is not 
necessary to include them in the fundamental core of required 
steps. 


 FDA acknowledges the conclusion of the MSSP project that, 
for seafood at least, it is possible to include sanitation within 
an HACCP system without unduly overburdening that system with 
large numbers of critical control points. The FDA/NOAA HACCP-based seafood pilot program included critical control
points for 
sanitation. For these regulations, however, FDA has tentatively 
decided to propose specific HACCP-type requirements for 
sanitation, rather than require that processors identify critical 
control points for sanitation in their HACCP plans. The proposed 
requirements in  123.10 potentially relate to an entire 
facility, not just to a limited number of critical control 
points. FDA tentatively concludes that this step is necessary to 
fully implement section 402(a)(4) of the act and yet at the same 
time not overload the HACCP system. FDA invites comments on this 
approach. 


 In particular, FDA invites comment on whether sanitation 
requirements should be enumerated as in proposed  123.10. The 
logical alternative would be to leave sanitation as one of the 
procedures that is to be identified and addressed in HACCP plans 
for the control of microbiological and physical hazards (see 
proposed  123.6(b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(ix), and (b)(4)), but not to 
have specific provisions in the regulations as to how sanitation 
is to be achieved. Good sanitation blocks avenues for the 
introduction of pathogens, harmful chemicals, and physical 
objects and is an essential preventive control for safety. Even 
if a product is to be cooked by the consumer, the load of 
microbiological pathogens on that product when received by the 
consumer is still relevant to safety. FDA's prescriptive 
approach to sanitation in proposed  123.10 is intended to assist 
processors to provide the greatest protection for consumers. 
Nonetheless, FDA invites comment on whether an alternative 
approach as described above would ensure this protection at less 
cost. 


 FDA is proposing in  123.10(a) to require that processors 
conduct sanitation inspections to ensure that the sanitation 
conditions in  123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) are met. FDA 
recognizes that the nature of the operations conducted by a 
processor affects the hazards that may be presented by the 
product. Processing other than storing usually involves 
manipulation of exposed, i.e., unpackaged, fish and fishery 
products. Both the manipulation and the exposure subject the 
product to all the hazards that can occur from unsanitary 
practices. Storage, on the other hand, can subject the product 
to some, but nowhere near all, of the hazards associated with 
insanitation. Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that 
processors of fish and fishery products inspect for those 
conditions in  123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) that are appropriate 
to their circumstances. FDA expects that, at a minimum, in, for 
example, storage facilities, such inspections will include 
ensuring against the presence of vermin, because this is a 
frequent problem in warehouses that can affect products even when 
they are being stored in a packaged state. 


 In  123.10(a)(1), the agency is proposing to require that 
processors ensure that water that contacts the product or food-contact surfaces, or that is used in the manufacture
of ice, is 
derived from a safe and sanitary source or is treated to render 
it of safe and sanitary quality. Water is used in virtually all 
fish and fishery product processing facilities for washing raw 
materials, product contact surfaces, and employees' hands. It is 
used to transport fish through the plant in water flumes. In 
addition, water is often an ingredient, as in soups and glazes. 
Contaminated water can serve as a vehicle for contamination of 
the product, both directly and indirectly (Refs. 63, 64; 65, p. 
49; 66, 67, and 68, pp. 1 and 2). It can also serve as a vehicle 
for contamination as the ice in which the product is stored. 


 The safety and sanitary quality of water from United States 
and some foreign public water systems is generally ensured 
through public water treatment, chlorination, or monitoring and 
control by local health authorities. Where this assurance 
exists, FDA does not anticipate that processors will need to 
implement any additional controls.

Private sources of water, particularly surface waters or 
water from shallow wells, may be subject to microbiological, 
chemical, or radiological contamination attributable to the 
source itself or to surface contamination at the well head or 
intake. Private sources are also frequently untreated or 
minimally treated (Refs. 69, p. 15; and 70). Where the processor 
uses a private source of water, it will need to take steps to 
ensure that the water is of a safe and sanitary quality. These 
steps may include retaining a copy of the initial local health 
authority well design approval and copies of the local health 
authority fecal coliform test results; obtaining and maintaining 
copies of private coliform test results; performing and recording 
periodic inspections of the sanitary condition of the well head 
or source intake; and performing and monitoring appropriate water 
treatment procedures, including filtration, sedimentation, and 
chlorination. 


 The type and frequency of controls exercised by the 
processor should be based upon the type of source water and its 
historic safety and sanitary quality. Consequently, the agency 
is proposing to require, in  123.10(c)(3), that such controls be 
performed and documented at such frequency as necessary to ensure 
control. In  123.10(a)(2), as a means of ensuring that potable 
water does not become contaminated, the agency is proposing to 
require that the processor ensure that there are no cross 
connections between the potable water system and any nonpotable 
systems. Nonpotable systems include waste water and sewage. 
Cross connections, which include situations that allow for back 
siphonage into a potable system from a nonpotable system under 
negative pressure conditions, can result in the chemical or 
microbiological contamination of the potable water system (Refs. 
64; 65, pp. 50 and 51; 68, 71, and 72). For example, if a hose 
from a potable water system is left in a thawing tank with water 
and frozen fish, and if negative pressure occurs that draws water 
from the tank back through the hose to the potable water system, 
both the potable water line and the water source itself, i.e., 
the municipal or private water system, can become contaminated. 


 Cross connections can best be controlled by performing 
periodic inspections of the potable and nonpotable systems. 
These inspections should be performed at least every time that 
there is a change in the plumbing of the systems and with 
sufficient additional frequency to ensure that unintentional 
cross connections do not develop. Consequently, in 
 123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that such 
inspections be performed and documented at such frequency as 
necessary to ensure control. 


 FDA is proposing in  123.10(a)(3) to require that the 
processor ensure that all food-contact surfaces are designed, 
constructed, and maintained in a manner that minimizes the 
potential for chemical and microbiological contamination of the 
product. Utensils and equipment can be vehicles for microbial 
contamination of both the raw and finished products. Utensils, 
equipment, and other food-contact surfaces that are made of 
corrosive material or wood, or that contain breaks, pits, cuts, 
or grooves, may harbor pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate 
to the product and contaminate it. These kinds of surfaces are 
difficult to clean, with the pores and crevices shielding the 
microorganisms from the action of cleaning and sanitizing agents 
(Refs. 65, pp. 20, 36-48; 72, pp. 166 and 167; and 73).

Additionally, where food-contact surfaces are constructed of 
toxic materials (e.g., lead shucking blocks), the product may be 
directly contaminated with the toxic material (Ref. 74). 
Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that it is necessary to 
require that processors take affirmative steps to minimize the 
possibility that any risks will be created by the utensils and 
equipment they use. 

Proper construction of the equipment should be ensured at 
the time it is received, and whenever it is modified or repaired. 
The frequency of subsequent inspections necessary to ensure that 
the sanitary condition of the equipment has not declined with 
time will depend on the frequency of its use, the materials and 
construction methods, and the nature of its use. In 
 123.10(c)(3) the agency is proposing to require that such 
controls be performed and documented with such frequency as is 
necessary to ensure control. 

In  123.10(a)(4), the agency is proposing to require that 
the processor ensure that food-contact surfaces are regularly 
cleaned and sanitized with cleaning and sanitizing preparations 
that are suitable for this purpose. Surfaces that are not 
adequately cleaned and sanitized can be a source of filth to 
subsequent products produced on the equipment, an attractant for 
vermin, and a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms. 
Infrequent cleaning of equipment can result in the formation of 
biofilms, microscopic films in which microorganisms can be 
entrapped, shielded from the action of sanitizers, and physically 
bound to the food-contact surface of the equipment. 

An effective cleaning compound is one that will lower the 
surface tension of water so that spills can be lifted and flushed 
away. Ordinary soap is generally ineffective for equipment 
washing because of its limited ability to solubilize fats, oils, 
and proteins. Mildly alkaline detergents are generally suitable 
for cleaning seafood processing plants, but high alkaline 
detergents are often necessary for heavy buildups of fats and 
proteins. Mineral deposits will frequently require the use of 
acid cleaners. 

An effective sanitizing agent is one that has a good 
bacteriocidal effect on the types of pathogens normally present 
in the plant environment and is safe, stable, and convenient for 
use. Examples include hypochlorites, iodophors, and quaternary 
ammonium compounds (Refs. 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77). 

To eliminate the product residue that accumulates on 
product contact surfaces during production, FDA is proposing in 
 123.10(a)(4)(i) to require that utensils and surfaces of 
equipment that contact food during processing be thoroughly 
washed at the end of the day's operations. FDA is also proposing 
in  123.10(a)(4)(iii) that sanitizing be performed on the same 
utensils and equipment immediately before the beginning of 
production, so that any recontamination that occurs between 
cleaning and production can be eliminated.

FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(a)(4)(ii) that, in 
those operations in which microbiological contamination can 
adversely affect the safety of the product (e.g., the processing 
of cooked, ready-to-eat products), the equipment also be washed 
and sanitized at least every 4 hours during processing. Washing 
and sanitizing with this frequency is necessary to inactivate 
mesophilic pathogens, such as 

Salmonella spp.

, before they leave 
the lag phase of growth and enter the rapid log phase (Ref. 23). 
Temperatures in fish and fishery product processing plants are 
generally not low enough to control the growth of such 
microorganisms and are certainly not low enough to control the 
growth of such psychrotropic pathogens as 

L. monocytogenes

 (Refs. 
23, 78, 79, and 80). Therefore, FDA tentatively finds that 
washing and sanitizing equipment every 4 hours is necessary. 

FDA is proposing to require both cleaning and sanitizing 
because neither step is fully effective without the other. When 
sanitizing occurs without benefit of cleaning, pathogenic 
microorganisms can be protected from the action of the sanitizer 
by food residue. Conversely, while cleaning can effectively 
remove product residue and a portion of the microorganisms, 
sanitizing is generally needed to remove the remaining 
microorganisms (Refs. 81 and 82). 

FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(c)(2) that the 
processor inspect the condition of the utensils and surfaces of 
equipment that contact food immediately after each cleaning and 
sanitizing. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure the 
adequacy of the cleaning and sanitizing operations, and to ensure 
that the equipment is in a condition that is suitable for further 
operations. 

The agency is also proposing in  123.10(c)(2) that the 
processor document the time of each cleaning and sanitizing, the 
concentration of the sanitizer, and the condition of the 
equipment. Documentation of the time of each cleaning and 
sanitizing will facilitate an assessment of compliance with the 
frequency requirement of  123.10(a)(4). Documentation of the 
concentration of the sanitizer will facilitate an assessment of 
the adequacy of the sanitizing operation. Sanitizers must be of 
sufficient strength to be effective, while excessive sanitizer 
concentrations can contaminate the product with indirect food 
additives (21 CFR part 178) (Ref. 82). Documentation of the 
condition of the equipment is necessary to ensure that it is 
examined after cleaning and sanitizing to make sure that these 
processes were done properly. 

The agency is proposing in  123.10(a)(5) to require that 
the processor ensure that gloves and outer garments that contact 
the food or food-contact surfaces are made of an impermeable 
material and are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. 
Gloves or aprons that are made of cloth or other porous materials 
are difficult to clean and may serve as a reservoir for 
pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate to the food during 
processing, in much the same manner as previously described for 
processing equipment (Refs. 65 and 83). Gloves and aprons that 
are not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition can also 
house pathogens that can migrate to the food. Therefore, FDA 
tentatively finds that it is appropriate to require the measures 
set out in  123.10(a)(5). 

At  123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that, 
like most of the other sanitation measures that FDA is proposing, 
the sanitary condition and impermeability of gloves and outer 
garments that may contact the food or food-contact surfaces be 
checked at least daily while processing operations are occurring. 
Such checking will ensure that employees arriving for work are 
equipped with gloves and outer garments that will not serve as a 
source of contamination to the product. It will also ensure that 
employees are never using personally owned gloves and garments 
that are made of materials that are unsuitable for the processing 
environment. Proposed  123.10(c) also requires that such 
checking be documented on a daily basis to provide a record that 
such checking has occurred. 

Under proposed  123.10(a)(6), the processor must ensure 
that employees' hands, gloves, outer garments, utensils, and 
food-contact surfaces that come into contact with insanitary 
objects are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before contacting 
fish or fishery products. Under proposed  123.10(a)(7), the 
processor must also ensure that employees' hands, gloves, outer 
garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces that contact raw 
products are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before they contact 
cooked product. 

Employees and food-contact surfaces can serve as vectors in 
the transmission of filth and pathogenic microorganisms to the 
food. Filth and pathogenic microorganisms can be brought into 
the processing environment on the employees' hands from outside 
areas, restrooms, contaminated raw materials, waste or waste 
receptacles, floors, and other insanitary objects (Refs. 63, 64, 
73, 74, 84, and 85). 

Bacteria naturally present on fresh fish skin and gills and 
in the gastrointestinal tract reflect the microbial content of 
the water from which the fish were harvested. Typical 
microorganisms found on and in fresh fish include 

C. botulinum

, 
enteric bacteria, 

Vibrio parahaemolyticus

, salmonella, shigella, 
hepatitis A, and other microorganisms that pollute harvest waters 
(Ref. 7). These microorganisms contaminate the environment in 
processing plants and cannot, using reasonable methods, be 
completely eliminated. 

Proper precautions, such as proper hand and equipment 
cleaning and sanitizing, must be taken to minimize opportunities 
for contamination of the finished product (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 
and 84). Therefore, FDA is proposing in  123.10 (a)(6) and 
(a)(7) that such precautions be taken with respect to hands, 
gloves, garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces.

The agency recognizes that not all processing activities 
will require hand washing and sanitizing. Activities that would 
not require such steps include the handling of raw fish and 
fishery products prior to the initial washing step (i.e., 
directly from the fisherman) and the handling of finished 
products in shipping cases. These activities are exceptions, 
however, to the general rule that employees must thoroughly wash 
and sanitize their hands after each contact with an insanitary 
surface. Additionally, when insanitary objects come into contact 
with product contact surfaces, they must be thoroughly cleaned 
and sanitized. 
In the processing of cooked products, the raw material may 
also serve as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms. For this 
reason, employees or equipment that handle or touch the raw 
material must be cleaned and sanitized before being used with 
cooked product or ice, or they could convey the microorganisms to 
these foods (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 84, 87, and 88). 
In  123.10(c)(1), the agency is proposing to require that 
the sanitary practices of the employees, especially as they 
relate to hand washing, sanitizing practices, and the potential 
for cross contamination, be checked and recorded at least every 4 
hours during processing. This monitoring will ensure that 
employees arriving for work and returning from the midshift break 
have properly washed and sanitized their hands. The 
concentration of hand sanitizing solutions tends to be reduced 
over the course of a production day because of the reaction of 
the sanitizer with organic matter and dissipation as a gas (Ref. 
82). It will also cause a regular assessment of the adequacy of 
the normal operating procedures. Finally, recording will provide 
assurance that appropriate procedures are being followed. 
In  123.10(a)(8)(i), FDA is proposing to require that hand 
washing facilities be located in all processing areas in which 
washing and sanitizing is required by CGMP's so that these 
facilities are readily accessible to employees who work in 
processing areas. The agency has tentatively concluded that proper sanitization is such an important part of preventing
the 
spread of disease as to warrant a requirement that hand washing 
equipment be conveniently located to facilitate their use. Where 
these facilities are not conveniently located, they may not be 
frequented by the employees. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(a)(8)(ii) that these 
facilities be equipped with hand cleaning and effective 
sanitizing preparations and single-service towels or suitable 
hand drying devices. Ordinary soap is acceptable for hand 
washing. Hand sanitizers need to be fast acting because of the 
short contact time involved. In contrast to the sanitizing of 
equipment, which can involve leaving a sanitizing spray on the 
equipment for extended periods of time, hand sanitizing usually 
involves a quick dip in and out of the sanitizer. Of the 
sanitizers described previously (see discussion of proposed 
 123.10(a)(4)), quaternary ammonium is not fast acting and is 
not suitable as a hand sanitizer. The others are appropriate as 
hand sanitizers.

The agency is proposing to require single-service towels or 
suitable hand drying devices to ensure that microbiological 
contamination does not occur though the repeated use of the same 
towel by several individuals. A hot-air blower is an example of 
a suitable hand drying device because contamination from 
individual to individual is eliminated. 
In  123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that 
inspection and documentation of the location of hand washing 
facilities be performed at sufficient frequency to ensure that 
there is compliance with  123.10(a)(8)(i). Generally, this 
procedure will be necessary only after construction or any 
significant building or process modification. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(c) that the 
processor inspect, and document that it has inspected, the hand 
washing and hand sanitizing facilities to ensure that they are 
properly equipped no less than once per day. This procedure will 
ensure that cleaning and sanitizing preparations, as well as 
towels or hand drying devices, are present whenever needed by 
employees. 
FDA is proposing to require at  123.10 (a)(9) and (a)(10) 
that the processor protect the food, food-contact surfaces, and 
food packaging materials against adulteration by chemical and 
physical contaminants. Such protection is necessary to ensure 
that the food produced by the processor is safe. The use of 
toxic compounds (e.g., pesticides, cleaning and sanitizing 
agents, and lubricants) is frequently necessary in the processing 
environment. For example, lubricants and fuel are necessary to 
operate equipment. Improper use of these compounds is a frequent 
cause of product adulteration throughout the food industry (Ref. 
74). Thus, it is necessary to ensure that food, food-contact 
surfaces, and food packaging materials are not contaminated by 
these toxic compounds. Food and food packaging material should 
be protected or removed from areas where pesticides are used, and 
caustic cleaning compounds should be thoroughly removed from 
food-contact surfaces before processing begins. Finally, as an 
additional protection, FDA is proposing to require in 
 123.10(a)(10) that toxic compounds be labeled, held, and used 
in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination of the 
product. 
FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(c) that the 
processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the food is 
protected from toxic compounds, and that this inspection be 
documented. This check should normally be performed before the 
start of operations, at a time when the equipment can be 
effectively inspected, and in time to prevent adulteration of the 
product. Because processing conditions vary on a day-to-day 
basis, FDA has tentatively concluded that daily inspection is 
necessary. 
FDA is proposing to require at  123.10(a)(11) that the 
processor ensure that products are not exposed to contaminants 
that may drip, drain, or be drawn into the food. An example of 
such a contaminant is condensate, which may form on the ceilings 
and equipment in a processing plant. If the condensate forms on 
an insanitary surface and then falls on the product, it may carry 
with it filth and microbiological contaminants from that surface 
to the food (Ref. 65, pp. 24 and 25). 
In  123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that the 
processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the potential 
for such contamination is minimized, and that this inspection be 
documented. This check should normally be performed during the 
actual operations, at a time when condensate or other such 
contaminating conditions are likely to be present. As explained 
above, the agency has tentatively concluded that daily variations 
in processing and climatic conditions necessitate daily 
inspection. 
In  123.10(a)(12), the agency is proposing to require that 
the processor ensure that compressed gases that contact food or 
food-contact surfaces of equipment are filtered or treated in 
such a way that the food is not contaminated with unapproved 
indirect food additives or other chemical, physical, or 
microbiological contaminants. Compressed gases can be 
contaminated with oil from the compressor, filth and 
microbiological contaminants from the air intake, and rust or 
other physical contaminants from the compression, storage, and 
distribution equipment. Filtration at the air intake and after 
compression, storage, and distribution is an effective means of 
reducing the risk of such contaminants entering the food (Ref. 
89).

FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(c)(3) that the 
filtration and other equipment used to protect the food from such 
contaminants be inspected, and the inspection documented, with 
such frequency as is necessary to ensure control. Normally, this 
frequency will be directed by the manufacturer of the filtration 
equipment. FDA is not proposing to require daily inspection 
because the filter and related equipment do not normally need 
cleaning or replacement on a daily basis. 



FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(a)(13) that the 
processor take action to ensure that unprotected cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products,
raw molluscan 
shellfish, and raw fish and fishery products are physically 
separated from each other during refrigerated storage. Cooked, 
ready-to-eat products are products that will not normally receive 
a cooking by the consumer adequate enough to kill pathogens. 
Therefore, any microbiological recontamination of the product 
after cooking can subject the consumer to health risks. Raw 
molluscan shellfish may contain pathogens that can cause severe 
illness to certain at-risk individuals, e.g., those who are 
immunocompromised. These individuals might know to avoid eating 
raw molluscan shellfish but would not expect the same health risk 
from cooked, ready-to-eat products. Similarly, raw fish and 
fishery products may contain filth and pathogenic microorganisms 
not normally associated with raw molluscan shellfish or cooked, 
ready-to-eat products (Refs. 63 and 84). 



In  123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that 
refrigerated storage areas be inspected at least daily to ensure 
that the three types of products are physically separated from 
each other. This check should normally be performed during 
actual operations, at a time when commingling of these products 
is likely to take place. The agency has tentatively concluded 
that daily inspection is necessary because products are normally 
moved in and out of refrigerated storage areas on a regular 
basis, creating an ongoing threat that problems will occur. 



FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(a)(14) that 
refrigerated storage units operate at 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below 
when storing raw materials, in-process or finished cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products,
and fish and 
fishery products made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin 
forming species. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure 
that processors control microbiological hazards associated with 
refrigerated storage for these products (Refs. 85 and 86). 
Cooked, ready-to-eat products as defined in proposed  123.3(b) 
and smoked fishery products (see Appendix 1) are not shelf-stable 
and must be kept refrigerated to retard the growth of 
microorganisms. As stated above, these products will not 
normally be cooked by the consumer at a sufficient temperature to 
destroy any pathogens that may be present. Scombroid toxin 
forming species are addressed in considerable detail later in 
this document. These species can form a toxin harmful to humans 
if subjected to time/temperature abuse after capture. 



Proper refrigeration is essential for fish and fishery 
products that include these species. Maintaining product 
temperatures during storage in a range that will minimize the 
growth of mesophilic and psychrotropic pathogens is necessary to 
ensure product safety throughout the shelf life of these products 
(Ref. 85). It is uniformly more convenient to control 
refrigeration unit temperatures than to control and monitor the 
internal temperatures of the various products under refrigerated 
storage, particularly when these products are in sealed 
containers. For these reasons, FDA is proposing that 
refrigeration units be operated at or below 40 
 F (4.4 
 C). FDA 
tentatively finds that this temperature is appropriate because it 
is adequate to minimize the growth of pathogens (Refs. 85 and 
86.) The agency also strongly recommends this temperature or 
lower for all fish and fishery products that need refrigeration, 
regardless of whether safety is an issue. The agency is also 
especially interested in obtaining comment on the appropriateness 
of this temperature. 



In  123.10(c)(4) the agency is proposing to require that 
the processor use instruments that monitor the temperature of 
refrigeration units on a continuous basis. The measurements from 
those instruments must be checked and documented with such 
frequency as is necessary to ensure control.

Continuous monitoring ensures that temperature fluctuations 
above 40 
 F (4.4 
 C), if any, as a result of circumstances such 
as heavy cooler loading, frequent cooler entry, or power 
failures, are quickly detected. The guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat 
products, in Appendix A, section 6, describes alternative ways to continuously monitor the temperature. A temperature-recording
device can show both the high temperature and the length of time that refrigeration unit was operating at that temperature.
Maximum-indicating thermometers and high 
temperature alarms also show that the critical limit has been 
exceeded but cannot show the duration of the deviation. 
Consequently, when a maximum-indicating thermometer or high 
temperature alarm reveals a deviation, the processor will need to 
assume loss of control since the last time that the measurements 
displayed by the instruments were checked, unless reasonable 
evidence exists to the contrary. The more frequent such checks 
are made, the lower the risk to which the processor is exposed. 
During periods when the refrigeration unit is not frequently 
entered and the load is constant, such as overnight, it is 
reasonable to reduce the frequency. However, during periods of 
heavy use and frequent entry, the frequency should be increased. 



FDA is proposing to require in  123.10(a)(15) that the 
processor ensure that persons with sores or illnesses that 
present an increased risk for product contamination are excluded 
from those areas of processing where such contamination is 
likely. Employees can serve as a reservoir of foodborne 
diseases, such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and hepatitis, that 
can be passed on to the consumer through the fecal-oral route. 
Additionally, open sores, boils, or infected wounds present the 
potential for contamination of the food with such pathogenic 
microorganisms as 

Staphylococcus aureus. 

Employees with 
suspicious illnesses or sores can be effectively screened upon 
arrival at the processing facility with minimal personal 
intrusion (Refs. 22, 74, and 84). 



In  123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that such 
screening, and documentation of the screening, take place daily. 
This frequency will ensure that changing health conditions of the 
employees are not missed. 



In  123.10(a)(16), the agency is proposing to require that 
the processor ensure that toilet facilities are available and 
maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair, and that 
these facilities provide for proper disposal of the sewage. 
Toilet facilities eliminate from the processing environment 
pathogenic microorganisms shed in fecal material. Where fecal 
material is not properly conveyed from the processing plant to an 
acceptable treatment facility, restroom floors and grounds around 
the processing facility can become contaminated with pathogens. 
Foot traffic over the affected areas can introduce pathogens to 
the processing room and cause product contamination. Insanitary 
toilet facilities can also increase the potential for 
contamination of employees' hands and, ultimately, the product 
(Refs. 64 and 74). 



FDA is proposing to require at  123.10(c) that the toilet 
facilities be inspected, and the inspection be documented, to 
ensure that they function properly and are in a sanitary 
condition at least every day. Ordinarily this inspection should 
be performed before each day's operation to ensure that the 
facility is ready at the beginning of the day. 



In  123.10(a)(17), the agency is proposing to require that 
the processor ensure that no pests are present in the processing 
area. Pests, such as rodents, birds, and insects carry a variety 
of human disease agents, which they can introduce to the 
processing environment (Refs. 63, 64, 73, and 84). Additionally, 
their feces constitutes filth which can contaminate the food. A 
daily inspection of the processing facility, as proposed in 
 123.10(c), serves to assess the effectiveness of the 
processor's pest control activities and redirect them where 
necessary. 



In  123.10(a)(18), the agency is proposing to require that 
the processor ensure that the plant is designed to minimize risk 
of contamination of the food. Proper construction is essential 
if the other sanitary measures that FDA is proposing to require 
are to be successful. It includes the isolation of incompatible 
operations, such as the handling of raw materials and the 
processing of cooked products (Refs. 71, 74, 87, and 88). A 
periodic inspection of the facility for structural defects, 
product flow, and general building condition is necessary to 
ensure that these attributes do not pose an increased potential 
for product contamination. In  123.10(c)(3), the agency is 
proposing to require that such controls be performed and 
documented with sufficient frequency to ensure control.

FDA is proposing to require at  123.10(b) that processors 
maintain sanitation control records that document the occurrence 
and findings of the inspections required by  123.10(a) as well 
as the frequency required by  123.10(c). FDA is also proposing 
to require that the problems found during these inspections be 
corrected, and the corrections recorded in accordance with 
proposed  123.10(d). Such corrections are essential to the 
proper working of the HACCP system. The records that are 
produced are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of 
proposed  123.8, including being subject to inspection by FDA 
investigators. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP-type 
preventive controls, including recordkeeping, will ensure that 
the hazards caused by insanitation are controlled by design. 
Recordkeeping is the key to an HACCP-type system. The agency's 
access to these records is essential to ensuring that the system 
is working. 
In addition to these proposed requirements, FDA is 
encouraging processors in  123.10(e) to have a written standard 
operating procedure for sanitation. The details of many 
sanitation procedures can differ from plant to plant depending 
upon the type of operation and other conditions. For example, 
how a piece of equipment should be cleaned can differ from plant 
to plant. In one plant, it may be necessary to disassemble all 
or part of the equipment in order to clean it. In other plants, 
breaking down the equipment may not be necessary. Likewise, 
different cleaning compounds may be needed from one plant to 
another in order to solve specialized problems such as buildups 
of mineral deposits. FDA is therefore encouraging each processor 
to study its own plant and develop a procedure that is tailored 
to that processor's needs and circumstances. 


2. Evisceration of Raw Fish 


In 1988, following botulism outbreaks traced to consumption 
of kapchunka, FDA published compliance policy guide (CPG) 7108.17 
for salt-cured, air-dried, uneviscerated fish (53 FR 44949 
November 7, 1988). In this CPG, FDA stated that the processing 
and sale of smoked and salted uneviscerated fish products pose a 
potential health hazard, and that it would consider such products 
to be adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act in that they 
have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions 
whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health (Ref. 
175). FDA issued this CPG in an effort to prevent further 
outbreaks, as well as other potential health hazards, related to 
the consumption of ungutted fish products. The agency recognized 
only two exceptions: (1) Small species, such as anchovies and 
herring pieces (sprats), provided that they are processed by a 
method that will ensure a water-phase salt content of at least 
10 percent, a water activity below 0.85, or a pH of 4.6 or less; 
and (2) fish that are fully cooked before further processing. 
As previously noted, 

C. botulinum

, as well as other 
microorganisms, are naturally present in the intestinal tract of 
both fresh-water fish and marine fish. Therefore, it is 
essential not only to remove the viscera but to do so in a manner 
that does not contaminate the fish flesh with viscera contents. 
It is the viscera that can contain the majority of the hazardous 
microorganisms (e.g., 

C. botulinum

 and 

L. monocytogenes

) that 
pose the potential health hazard (Refs. 165 through 167). After 
the viscera is removed, it must be discarded immediately to a 
segregated area, using a method that minimizes the potential for 
contamination or cross-contamination of utensils, equipment, raw 
materials, and other processed products. 
Uneviscerated fish that have been smoked, smoke-flavored, or 
salted, and that are intended to be filleted after processing, 
pose the same potential health hazard as those products sold as 
uneviscerated whole fish. The potential health hazard is created 
when the viscera is removed after processing. As the fish are 
being filleted, the viscera may be cut, and its contents may 
spill out, contaminating the processed fish. As a result, the 
opportunity arises for 

C. botulinum

 spore outgrowth and toxin 
production as well as for growth of other food spoilage 
microorganisms in these types of products. 
Therefore, the agency is proposing to require in  123.10(f) 
that, subject to the same limitations that were set forth in the 
CPG: (1) All fish for smoking or salting be eviscerated prior 
to processing, and (2) the process of evisceration must be 
performed in an area that is segregated and separate from other 
processing operations. 


H. Imported Seafood 


As stated earlier, imports make up over half of the seafood 
consumed in this country, in sharp contrast to meat and poultry, 
which are primarily domestically produced. Many of the hazards 
that can affect imported seafood are likely to occur before it 
enters the United States. These hazards include those that can 
be acquired from the environment before harvest and those that 
are process-induced. Detection of these hazards is the focus of 
the current regulatory system, and thus FDA tries to ensure 
safety by testing imported product. 
However, product testing places a substantial burden on the 
agency. The system currently is overburdened because of limits 
on the number of government personnel available to collect and 
analyze samples of imported product. In addition, FDA is 
concerned because this system does not promote industry 
responsibility and accountability the way an HACCP-based problem 
prevention system would. Given when most problems with imported 
seafood occur, these problems can be more efficiently controlled 
if the seafood is subject to HACCP controls before it is offered 
for import into this country than if the product is simply tested 
at the time that it is offered for sale. Therefore, FDA has 
tentatively concluded that these HACCP regulations should cover 
imported products in the same manner, to the extent possible, 
that they cover domestic products.

Accordingly, FDA is proposing to make importers subject to 
the general provisions of subpart A. Thus, FDA is proposing in 
 123.11(a) to require that products that are offered for import 
be produced under the same HACCP and sanitation controls that it 
is proposing to apply to domestically produced seafood. FDA is 
proposing to require that importers adopt an HACCP plan that 
includes the criteria for how they will decide to purchase and 
then handle seafood while it is under their control. They must 
also establish ways to determine that these requirements are 
being met. 
More specifically, the plan must include hazard analysis, 
critical control points, and critical limits for each type of 
product imported as well as a copy of each supplier's HACCP plan 
for those products, as required in  123.11(b). Under proposed 
 123.11(b), these plans must be available on file at the 
importer's U.S. place of business. As stated above, the agency 
is developing a hazard analysis book to assist importers, as well 
as processors, in designing their individual plans. 
Because of the proposed requirement of  123.11(b) that 
importers must have on file an HACCP plan from each of their 
foreign suppliers, foreign processors who wish to offer their 
products for import into the United States after the 
implementation of this regulation will have to operate under 
valid HACCP plans and sanitation control procedures and furnish 
copies of those plans to the U.S. importers. The foreign 
processors should maintain appropriate monitoring records, as dictated by the principles of HACCP already discussed.
These 
records should be kept at the foreign processors' places of 
business. 
Importers will be required under proposed  123.11(c) to 
take affirmative steps to monitor that their suppliers are in 
fact operating under their HACCP plans. Thus, under this 
proposal, the importer will need to take such steps as: (1) 
Obtaining records from the foreign processors' facilities; (2) 
obtaining certification from foreign governments that the 
suppliers are operating under valid HACCP plans or obtain 
certification lot by lot; (3) visiting the facilities to inspect 
them on a regular basis; or (4) taking some similar type of 
action, e.g., end product testing. 
For example, importers of swordfish may specify to their 
suppliers that the mercury level in the swordfish that they 
purchase cannot exceed FDA's action level of 1 part per million 
methyl mercury. The importers may decide to require certificates 
of analysis for methyl mercury on a regular basis from their 
suppliers as a means of ensuring that the swordfish that they 
offer for import into the United States is not adulterated. 
Section 123.11(d) provides an option for those importing 
from a country that has an active memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) or similar agreement with FDA. If the MOU is current, and 
if there is equivalency between the inspection system of the 
foreign country and the U.S. system, the importer will be able to 
rely on the MOU in lieu of the actions required under 
 123.11(c). An active MOU must accurately reflect the current 
situation between the signing parties and be functioning and 
enforceable in its entirety. It is the importer's responsibility 
to determine whether the MOU is in fact active, and whether it 
covers the products that the importer intends to receive from 
that country. 
Finally, the agency strongly encourages importers (as 
reflected in proposed  123.11(e)) to require their suppliers to 
obtain HACCP training such as is required in  123.9. 
Proposed  123.12 provides that there must be evidence that 
seafood offered for import has been produced in accordance with 
part 123, subpart A. As stated previously, FDA is including this 
requirement to ensure that there is equivalent treatment of 
imported and domestic products. FDA can ensure that domestic 
product is being produced in accordance with the HACCP plan and 
the sanitation controls in  123.10 through direct observation 
and review of records. Similar inspection of foreign processors 
would be prohibitively expensive. However, FDA tentatively finds 
that mere reliance on the existence of an HACCP plan is not 
enough, and that additional evidence of compliance must be 
provided. FDA tentatively finds that this evidence can be 
provided by the means listed in proposed  123.12(a). 
One of the ways that the agency contemplates obtaining this 
evidence would be by inspecting, at the importers' U.S. place of 
business, the importers' and foreign suppliers' HACCP plans, 
sanitation procedures, and records associated with the importers' 
plans. If these records demonstrate that the foreign processor and the importer are operating in accordance with
adequate HACCP 
plans, agency will have assurance that the food is not 
adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act. 
FDA also intends to pursue MOU's with countries that 
demonstrate that their inspection systems are and continue to be 
substantially equivalent to those in the United States (proposed 
 123.12(a)(2)). The existence of an active MOU between FDA and 
the country of origin covering the seafood products being offered 
for import will provide assurance that these products covered by 
the MOU are being produced under appropriate conditions. 
If there is no MOU, the agency will take into consideration, 
for purposes of verifying the compliance of imported seafood, 
knowledge that a foreign country has an advanced seafood 
inspection system that provides for plans that are HACCP based, 
as provided in proposed  123.12(a)(3). The existence of such a 
regulatory system and its enforcement will provide assurance 
about the conditions under which products exported from that 
country are being produced. 
Proposed  123.12(a)(4) provides that inspection of foreign 
processors by the agency or other organization designated by FDA 
may also be used to establish compliance with these regulations. 
Finally, the agency intends to use other measures as it 
finds appropriate to make determinations about the acceptability 
of the product being offered for import, including but not 
limited to end product testing, as in proposed  123.12(a)(5).

If assurances do not exist, as described in  123.12(a), 
that the product has been produced under an HACCP plan and under 
sanitation controls that are equivalent to those required of 
domestic processors, the agency will deny entry to the products 
as provided in proposed  123.12(b) because the product will 
appear to be adulterated (see section 801(a) of the act). 




I. Raw Molluscan Shellfish 





FDA is proposing to require in part 123, subpart C that 
processors of raw molluscan shellfish include in their HACCP 
plans how they control the origin of the molluscan shellfish that 
they process. Proposed  123.28 requires that these controls 
include obtaining raw shellfish only from approved growing waters 
through harvesters or processors licensed by a shellfish control 
authority. FDA is proposing to require that processors maintain 
records to document that each lot of raw molluscan shellfish 
meets these requirements. Under this proposal, these records 
will constitute HACCP records subject to the requirements of 
proposed  123.8. 



The agency is also proposing to establish a system of 
tagging or other labeling that provides information about the 
origin of all shellstock and shucked molluscan shellfish received 
by a processor. FDA is proposing to amend  1240.60 (21 CFR 
1240.60) to provide for such a tagging system. 


Raw molluscan shellfish are molluscan shellfish that have 
not been subject to a treatment sufficient to kill pathogens of 
public health significance. Shellfish that have been subjected 
to any form of treatment, such as steam, hot water, or dry heat, 
for a short period of time before shucking to facilitate removal 
of the meat from the shell are still considered to be raw.


Molluscan shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked pose 
unique public health risks. They probably cause the majority of 
all seafood-related illnesses in the United States (Refs. 6; and 
7, p. 330). The safety of raw molluscan shellfish directly 
reflects the cleanliness of its aquatic environment. Of all 
edible species of fish, molluscan shellfish are unique in that 
they are nonmotile, filter feeding organisms. They pump large 
quantities of water through their bodies during the normal 
feeding process (Refs. 7, p. 331; and 90, p. c-4). The positive 
relationship between harvesting areas contaminated by sewage 
pollution and shellfish-borne enteric disease has been 
demonstrated many times (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91 and 92). During 
feeding, the shellfish may concentrate pathogenic microorganisms, 
deadly toxins associated with naturally occurring marine plankton 
(Ref. 93), or forms of agricultural and industrial pollution 
(Ref. 94). Among the pathogenic microorganisms is the Norwalk 
virus, probably the most common cause of seafood-borne illness. 
This virus commonly occurs in waters contaminated by sewage 
effluent (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91, 92, and 95). 



Before the adoption of the current public health controls in 
the United States, shellfish commonly transmitted many serious 
communicable diseases. Consumption of raw or undercooked seafood 
from polluted waters can be a mode of transmission for typhoid 
fever, infectious hepatitis, and cholera (Ref. 67). These 
diseases are still commonly associated with raw shellfish 
consumption in lesser developed countries (Ref. 7, p. 73). 
However, the incidence of these diseases in the United States has 
been largely controlled under section 361 of the PHS Act (42 
U.S.C. 264). This statute was enacted to prevent the 
introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. 
Under provisions of the PHS Act, FDA is empowered to accept 
assistance from the States to protect public health. 
Accordingly, FDA participates in a Federal/State cooperative 
program called NSSP. 



Established in 1925, the NSSP provides water quality 
criteria for assessing the safety of shellfish growing areas. 
These criteria are applied by the States under the authority of 
their own laws. The NSSP ``Manual of Operations'' provides the 
basis (Refs. 90 and 96) for State regulation in 23 shellfish-producing States and 6 nations. Each participating State
or 
nation classifies and monitors its shellfish growing waters, 
controls harvesting, inspects shellfish packing and shucking 
facilities, and issues certificates to individual shellfish 
processors that meet the State or foreign government's shellfish 
control criteria.

To assist themselves in the implementation of their 
shellfish laws, the States have formed the ISSC. The ISSC is an 
organization of State officials, representatives of Federal 
agencies, and representatives of the shellfish industry. It 
provides guidance to the States and provides a forum for them to 
discuss their problems in attempting to ensure the sanitary 
control of shellfish handling and production (Ref. 97, p. 3). 



FDA evaluates State and international shellfish sanitation 
programs (Ref. 98, part I, p. 2). When it finds that the program 
is consistent with the NSSP, FDA accepts the State's or country's 
shipper certifications. FDA publishes the ``Interstate Certified 
Shellfish Shippers List'' monthly, in which it lists the 
approximately 2,000 shellfish dealers that have been certified by 
participating States. 



While FDA continues to believe in the cooperative 
partnership that it has established with the States, there is 
evidence that this system is not protecting the public health as 
well as it might (Refs. 7, p. 331; 99, p. iii; and 100). 
Problems can originate anywhere. As explained in the discussion 
above of the term ``lot of molluscan shellfish,'' the water from 
which shellfish are harvested plays a significant role in 
determining their safety. If they are harvested from 
unclassified or polluted waters, shellfish can be a vector of 
communicable disease. Problems can also occur as a result of 
conditions under which the shellfish are held on the harvest 
vessel, in the processing plant, or by subsequent handlers or 
repackers of shucked products. 



Given the current situation, FDA has tentatively determined 
that it is necessary for it to take steps to strengthen and 
provide additional support for the existing cooperative program. 
Thus, FDA is proposing two measures. 



First, FDA is proposing to add  1240.60(b), which will 
require that all shellfish offered for transport or transported 
in interstate commerce bear a tag that lists the date, place, 
type, and quantity of shellfish, and by whom it was harvested, 
including the harvester's identification number. FDA is 
proposing this requirement because it has determined that a tag 
is the only means by which the agency can ensure that it will be 
possible to determine whether the shellfish have been taken from 
safe water. FDA is proposing to require that the place where the 
shellfish were harvested be listed because it will enable a 
processor who receives the shellfish, or a regulatory official 
who inspects them, to determine whether they were taken from safe 
water. 



FDA is proposing to require that the date when the shellfish 
were harvested be listed because, as discussed above, the 
shifting conditions in shellfish harvesting waters make shellfish 
safety virtually a day-to-day proposition. Therefore, when the 
shellfish are harvested becomes a critical factor. 



FDA is proposing that the type of shellfish e.g., oysters, 
clams, mussels, or scallops, and quantity be shown on the tag or 
bill of lading to ensure that the tag is applied only to the 
product to which it was initially affixed. Information on type 
and quantity of shellfish describes that product. FDA is 
proposing to require that the person by whom the shellfish were 
harvested be listed because that person has the most direct 
knowledge of where and when the shellfish were harvested and 
should be readily identifiable in case there are problems with 
the shellfish, so that quick action can be taken to meet the 
effect of any problem. 



Finally, FDA is proposing that the harvester identification 
number issued by the shellfish control authority be included to 
provide a means to confirm the harvester's identity and to obtain 
the harvester's local address in case of an illness investigation 
or followup to tagging and labeling discrepancies. 



FDA is proposing this tagging requirement under section 361 
of the PHS Act. Under this section, the Surgeon General and, by 
delegation, FDA, is authorized to make and enforce such 
regulations as in FDA's judgment are necessary to prevent the 
introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease. 
FDA tentatively finds that requiring a tag is a measure necessary 
to prevent the spread of communicable diseases because the tag 
will readily permit identification of those raw shellfish that 
were harvested from properly classified waters, and thus that 
will not be vectors of communicable disease in interstate 
commerce, and those that were not harvested from properly 
classified waters and thus that may be vectors of disease. 



Under the PHS Act, FDA is also authorized to provide for 
such measures which in its judgment may be necessary to enforce 
the regulations that it adopts to prevent the spread of 
communicable diseases (section 361(a) of the PHS Act). 
Therefore, FDA is proposing to provide in  1240.60(b) for the 
seizure and destruction of any shellfish that are not properly 
tagged. Without the assurances provided by the tag, the 
shellfish may bear a microorganism that may render them injurious 
to health. Thus, they are unfit for consumption and must be

FDA recognizes that all shellfish-producing States have laws 
that require the tagging of shellfish. This proposal is intended 
to support those laws, not supersede them. The proposed tagging 
requirement is necessary for two reasons. First, there is no 
assurance that untagged shellfish come from safe waters. Illegal 
harvesting of molluscan shellfish from contaminated or 
unclassified waters is known to occur (Ref. 7, p. 331). It is 
also known that illegally harvested shellfish find their way into 
commercial channels. States and FDA find untagged or improperly 
tagged shellfish during their inspections of shellfish processors 
under the cooperative program (Refs. 101 through 109). FDA 
frequently lacks a basis for taking action against untagged 
shellfish (Ref. 110). Proposed  1240.60 will provide a basis. 
Second, State tagging requirements and sanctions are not uniform, 
and the sanctions provided under some State laws have little 
deterrent effect (Refs. 102, 103, and 109). The establishment of 
a Federal sanction will provide illegal harvesters with sure knowledge that if their catch enters interstate commerce
and 
comes to the attention of FDA, it will be destroyed. 
If  1240.60(b) is adopted, as a practical matter, product 
identification will begin at the harvesting site. FDA is 
proposing to amend  1240.60 to require that the first handler of 
live molluscan shellfish, be it the licensed harvester, licensed 
aquaculturist, or certified shellfish shipper, affix a tag to 
each container of shellfish. The tag will then provide the means 
for processors to ensure that the shellfish that they buy is from 
properly classified water. 
Moreover, the tag will provide all information that is 
necessary to trace the product to its source, e.g., date of 
harvest, location of harvest, quantity and type of shellfish, and 
the harvester's name and identification number assigned by the 
shellfish control authority. The product traceability that 
results will enhance epidemiological investigations in the event 
of shellfish-borne illness. It will also facilitate prompt 
remedial actions necessary to reestablish public health controls. 
The safety concerns about shucked molluscan shellfish are 
substantially the same as those discussed above for in-shell 
molluscan shellfish. Because shucked shellfish are packaged in a 
container that can be labeled, the agency is proposing to require 
in  1240.60(c) that for these shellfish, a label may be 
substituted that bears information equivalent to that found on 
the tag. Another reason for allowing labeling in lieu of a tag 
is the fact that one bag of unshucked molluscan shellfish bearing 
a single tag can typically be processed into more than one 
container of shucked molluscan shellfish. 
The second measure that FDA is proposing is based on its 
experience with the NSSP and the ISSC. FDA has tentatively 
concluded that the system for protecting the safety of shellfish 
can be significantly strengthened if the agency were to require 
that certain limited steps be taken as part of the processing of 
shellfish that are intended for interstate commerce. FDA 
believes that these measures, like the proposed tagging 
requirement, will serve to strengthen the Federal-State 
cooperative program as well as the shellfish safety programs of 
each of the States and countries that participate in NSSP. 
Many of the pathogens in shellfish, such as the Norwalk 
virus, are virtually undetectable. Moreover, from a technical 
and practical perspective, end product testing cannot be used in 
the processing of shellfish to ensure that they are not 
contaminated with one of the myriad of possible domestic, 
industrial, and agricultural contaminants that have been found in 
shellfish harvesting areas. Therefore, State classification of 
growing waters is a necessary first step to ensure the safety of 
shellfish. These classifications, as detailed in NSSP, address 
all actual and potential pollutants in deciding whether an area 
is suitable for harvesting (Ref. 90, pp. c-5 and c-6). 


FDA is proposing in  123.28(a) that each processor of 
shellfish have an HACCP plan that ensures that the molluscan 
shellfish that it processes come only from areas that have been 
classified by a shellfish control authority as satisfactory for 
harvesting. As noted above, the safety of molluscan shellfish 
consumed raw or partly cooked is predicated on the cleanliness of 
the growing area waters from which they are obtained. Ensuring 
that shellfish come from properly classified growing areas is 
where shellfish safety begins. 
Under proposed  123.28(b), processors are to process only 
shellfish that originate from growing waters that have been 
approved for harvesting by a shellfish control authority as shown 
by product tags or labels with specific information that 
establishes that they were harvested from appropriate waters. 
FDA is proposing this requirement under both section 361 of the 
PHS Act, to prevent the spread of communicable disease, and 
sections 402(a)(1), 402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the act to ensure 
that the food does not contain any added substances that may 
render it injurious to health and is not prepared, packed, or 
held under insanitary conditions whereby it may be rendered 
injurious to health.

Under proposed  123.28(b)(2) and (b)(3), the shellstock tag 
from a licensed harvester or certified processor, or the bill of 
lading accompanying bulk shipments, will contain the information 
required under proposed  1240.60(b) and thus document whether 
the shellfish are from an acceptable source. 
The proposed requirement  123.28(b) that only shellfish 
drawn from such acceptable sources can be processed will place a 
premium on properly tagged products from shellfish dealers that 
States or nations that participate in NSSP have certified. 
The agency is further proposing to require in  123.28(c) 
that shucked products be subject to the same requirements that 
apply to shellstock. FDA is doing so because the safety of 
shucked shellfish products, like shellstock, depends on the 
quality of the water where they are grown. Therefore, the same 
requirements are needed. 
FDA is further proposing to require in  123.28(d) that the 
processor maintain records that document that each lot of 
shellfish meets the tagging or labeling requirements in 
 123.28 (b) or (c) (see Refs. 104 and 108). The information that 
FDA is proposing to require to be maintained in records simply 
reflects these requirements. Permanent records are needed to 
demonstrate that processors are controlling the origin of the 
shellfish they process. In addition, permanent records will 
facilitate epidemiological investigations by allowing complete 
product traceability to the source of origin. 
The protection of shellfish consumers also requires that 
domestic and imported products be treated equally. While 
imported raw molluscan shellfish are subject to the same 
standards as domestic shellfish with regard to adulteration and 
misbranding, Federal law does not require that imported shellfish 
come from waters that were classified by a public health 
authority. This double standard is unfair to domestic 
processors, and both ISSC and industry representatives have urged 
the Federal Government to address this problem (Refs. 111 and 
112). While virtually all States have chosen to reject imported 
shellfish that are not tagged as coming from classified waters 
(Ref. 113), it is known that such shellfish nonetheless enter 
interstate commerce (Ref. 107). Untagged imports originating 
from uncertified producers compromise the effectiveness of 
seafood safety programs (Ref. 7, p. 73) and product traceability. 
Therefore, FDA is proposing that all raw shellfish products 
either from domestic or foreign origin must comply with the 
requirements in part 123 and  1240.60. 
Thus, if  123.28(b), for example, is adopted, it will mean 
that only those molluscan shellfish that are harvested in a 
foreign country that has a program that incorporates the type of 
measures set out in the NSSP for approving growing waters will be 
appropriate for processing. Such a program will need to include 
measures that provide for water classification, monitoring, and 
other related activities if it is to ensure that the growing 
waters that it approves are safe, and thus that the shellfish 
that are drawn from such waters are not adulterated. FDA has 
found that the best way to establish that a foreign country's 
program meets this standard is through the development of an MOU 
between the agency and that country. Currently, such agreements 
exist with Australia, Canada, Chile, England, Iceland, Japan, 
Republic of Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand. 
In summary, FDA anticipates that these proposed requirements 
will improve the safety of raw molluscan shellfish by 
establishing uniform requirements for domestic and imported 
products and prohibiting interstate movement of shellfish that is 
not properly tagged to demonstrate that it came from an 
appropriate harvesting area. 
The effectiveness of State shellfish sanitation programs and 
the NSSP will be strengthened by the proposed mandatory tagging, 
labeling, and recordkeeping requirements, which will allow 
complete product traceability to its source of origin. Should 
illnesses occur, product traceability will facilitate a rapid 
determination of when a problem occurred and allow immediate 
remedial actions to restore public health controls. Also, 
requiring proper tagging or labeling will place a premium on 
State and foreign shellfish sanitation and processor 
certification programs.

J. Guideline for Cooked, Ready-to-Eat Fishery Products 


FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix A for cooked, 
ready-to-eat fishery products. These products possess an 
elevated microbiological risk relative to most other seafood 
products because they are cooked as part of processing and do not 
normally receive any additional cooking by consumers before 
consumption. Consequently, to be safe, these products must be 
essentially pathogen-free by the time they leave the processing 
facility. Immediate refrigeration at proper temperatures to 
prevent the growth of pathogens is also essential for these 
products, which are not shelf-stable. 
The guideline addresses critical control points that apply 
to these products as a class and that thus will typically be 
identified in the HACCP plans of most processors of cooked, 
ready-to-eat products. The guideline also addresses ways of 
controlling hazards at each critical control point. Processors 
of cooked, ready-to-eat products that are also smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products should apply the controls
set forth in 
Appendix 1. If FDA adopts that regulation, it will codify it in 
reserved subpart B of part 123. 
This guideline is not relevant to most of the cooked, ready-to-eat products that are processed as low acid canned foods
under 
part 113. However, the recommendations in Appendix A, section 
4. a., b., and d. for cooling, processing after cooking, and refrigerated storage, will apply to those low acid canned
foods 
that are cooked, processed, and then cooked again. 
The guideline provides information on how to control the 
growth of 

S. aureus 

during the processing step between cooks. It 
also addresses the control of microbiological hazards that can 
occur within the processing environment for cooked, ready-to-eat 
products. It does not address nonprocessing hazards, because 
they are not relevant to this class of products. FDA intends to 
publish separate guidance that will, among other things, address 
nonprocessing hazards. Likewise, this guideline will not address 
the nonsafety hazards, such as decomposition that is not 
associated with human illness and economic adulteration, that FDA 
has suggested in proposed  123.6(c) should be covered by the 
HACCP plan. These hazards will also be covered in the separately 
published guidance. Economic adulteration, for example, is 
addressed in Appendix D. 
FDA has tentatively decided to address the processing 
controls for cooked, ready-to-eat products in a guideline, rather 
than by regulation, to permit flexibility in the face of changing 
processing technologies and knowledge. As stated earlier in this 
preamble, the guidelines are intended to advise processors about 
what FDA believes will be acceptable in a HACCP plan. The agency 
acknowledges, however, that there are basic processing norms to 
which conscientious processors adhere, and that these norms are 
not likely to change for the foreseeable future. FDA therefore 
invites comments on whether any or all of the guideline on the 
cooked, ready-to-eat products ought to be codified as 
requirements in part 123 if it is adopted as a final regulation. 


1. Thermal Processing: Cooking and Pasteurization 
Processes and Equipment 


The proposed guideline in Appendix A, section 4 advises 
processors on how to ensure that: (1) Their cooking and 
pasteurization processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens; 
and (2) their cooking and pasteurization equipment is adequate 
to deliver their cooking and pasteurization processes. A cooking 
process is, in essence, the temperature and time at that 
temperature that will both kill pathogens and create a marketable 
product. A pasteurization process is the temperature and time at 
temperature that is necessary to reduce the numbers of pathogens 
to the point where they will not cause harm over the shelf life 
of a refrigerated product. It is essential that 

C. botulinum 


type E not survive the pasteurization process for cooked, ready-to-eat products that are packed in hermetically
sealed containers 
and held at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 52). Such containers 
are typically vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged and thus can 
provide a good environment for the growth of 

C. botulinum 

type E. 
To meet the requirements in part 123, subpart A, processors 
must have assurance that their cooking and pasteurization 
processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens and must document 
this assurance in their HACCP records. This approach is similar 
to that in the regulations for low acid canned foods, which 
require that processors of those products know that their thermal 
processes are adequate to destroy 

C. botulinum

. The low acid 
canned food regulations do not specify to processors what their 
time/temperature parameters must be in order to destroy those 
pathogens. There are simply too many variables and possibilities 
with regard to thermal processing parameters for this kind of 
specificity in those regulations to be practical or appropriate. 
Rather, the regulations require that processors use a thermal 
process that is at least equivalent to one established by a 
competent process authority, i.e., a third party who has the 
expertise to determine the parameters of a thermal process that 
will destroy pathogens (Ref. 85). 
This approach has served the consuming public, the agency, 
and the industry well over the years. FDA is therefore 
recommending in proposed Appendix A, section 4. a.1. and b.1. that 
processors utilize the services of process authorities to 
establish the parameters of their cooking and pasteurization 
processes.

<TEXT>
 

A process authority could be a private individual, a member 
of academia, or an agency of government. Processors can find 
competent process authorities through their trade associations, 
local Sea Grant extension offices, or State universities. 
The procedures that are used in establishing a cooking or 
pasteurization process should be generally recognized and 
accepted. Such procedures may include thermal death time, heat 
penetration, and inoculated pack studies, as necessary, to 
establish the minimum process necessary to destroy pathogens. In 
cases where the cooking process or pasteurization process is 
standardized and not unique to a specific processor, articles in 
journals; Federal, State, or local regulations and guidelines; or 
other appropriate vehicles could provide process parameters (Ref. 
52). Whatever the source, processors must retain the 
documentation from the process authority that the process will be 
effective as part of their HACCP records, in accordance with 
proposed  123.8(c). 
The process established by a process authority should 
include values for those aspects of the process that can affect 
the destruction of pathogens. The most notable of these are 
cooking times and temperatures. Others may include the initial 
internal temperature of the cooking medium before the cooking, 
the product size and species, and the viscosity of formulated 
products such as soups. 
FDA is already aware that the cooking processes necessary to 
create a marketable product for several types of cooked, ready-
to-eat products are many times more lethal than necessary to 
inactivate pathogens (Ref. 114). The products are the several 
types of crabs listed in the guidelines at proposed Appendix A, 
section 4.a.4. FDA has tentatively concluded that, for these 
products, the adequacy of both the cooking process and cooking 
equipment can be assumed. 
It is likely that other products could be added to this 
list. The agency invites comments on this point. Comments should 
be accompanied by data that will enable the agency to determine 
that the minimum cooking process necessary to achieve a 
marketable product, e.g., heat penetration data and data on the 
range of cooking processes (times and temperatures) applied to 
that product, will produce a safe product. 
The same general principles also apply to the design of the 
cooking and pasteurization equipment. It is necessary that this 
equipment be designed and operated so that every unit of product 
receives the established minimum cooking or pasteurization 
process proposed (Appendix A, section 4. a.2. and b.2.) (Ref. 85). 
FDA recommends that the equipment be evaluated for design and 
operation by a process authority who is familiar with the 
dynamics of temperature distribution in processing equipment. In 
some instances, temperature distribution studies may be necessary 
to establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances, 
existing literature should be sufficient. Processors must obtain 
and retain documentation that the equipment will provide the 
minimum process as part of their HACCP records in accordance with 
 123.8. 


2. Container Integrity 


The proposed guidelines advise in Appendix A, section 3. c. 
and d. that HACCP plans prepared in accordance with part 123, 
subpart A will normally identify finished product container 
sealing for pasteurized products and postpasteurizing cooling as 
critical control points. Contamination with 

C. botulinum 

type E 
during the postpasteurization cooling step is a special food 
safety hazard that must be controlled for pasteurized products. 
Two potential causes of recontamination are poor container seams 
and contaminated cooling water. Consequently, the guidelines, at 
Appendix A, section 5, recommend controls that processors can 
utilize that are likely to meet the requirements of subpart A. 
Appendix A, section 5.a. advises processors how to inspect 
finished product containers of pasteurized products for container 
integrity to ensure a consistently reliable hermetic seal. At 
proposed Appendix A, section 5.b., the guidelines advise about 
testing for the presence of sanitizer in cooling water. 
Seam inspections should determine whether the seams conform 
to the manufacturer's guidelines. Additionally, because of 
variations from seaming head to seaming head, from closing 
machine to closing machine, and over time for any one machine or 
head, FDA recommends that processors conduct inspections for each 
machine and head at least every 4 hours. Visual seam inspections 
are not adequate to fully assess the integrity of the seam. 
Physical testing and, in the case of double seams, seam teardown 
and measurement, are necessary parts of the inspection, as 
presently required for low acid canned foods in part 113. 
The presence of sanitizer in cooling water provides a 
control for the risk of microbiologically contaminated water 
being drawn into the can. A vacuum created by a collapse in the 
cooling vat of the steam head in the container, generated during 
the heating step, can draw in a minute amount of cooling water 
and any pathogens contained in that cooling water. Seams are in 
a particularly stressed condition at that time. Sanitizer 
strength levels should be checked periodically because there is a 
tendency for variation in strength to occur, particularly in 
batch-type systems.

3. Time and Temperature 


The guidelines advise, in proposed Appendix A, section 3. e., f., g., and h., that HACCP plans prepared in accordance
with 
subpart A of part 123 will normally identify cooling after 
cooking, processing after cooking, final product cooling, and 
refrigerated storage, as critical control points. The potential 
exists for some pathogenic microorganisms to survive the cooking 
process, regardless of the controls that are in place at that 
step. Likewise, despite a processor's efforts to minimize 
recontamination of the cooked product with pathogens, the 
potential exists for some pathogens to be reintroduced. For 
these reasons, it is imperative that exposure of the product 
after the cooking process to temperatures that permit the growth 
of pathogens be kept to a minimum, since larger numbers are 
frequently associated with a greater potential for disease. 
To control hazards as required by part 123, subpart A, the 
process must take steps to restrict time/temperature abuse of the 
cooked product to the point that pathogens such as 

Salmonella 
spp. 

do not enter the rapid (logarithmic) phase of growth. By 
restricting pathogen growth to the slow (lag) phase, pathogen 
numbers should remain constant or increase only slightly. 
Proposed Appendix A, section 6.a. provides a way to control 
the growth of pathogens immediately after cooking. It advises 
that, after cooking, the product should be cooled from 140 
 F (60 

 C) to 70 
 F (21.1 
 C) within two hours. This time/temperature 
combination is based on the upper limit for growth (i.e., 140 
 F) 
and the lower limit for rapid growth (i.e., 70 
 F) of such 
mesophilic pathogens as 

Salmonella spp.

 and 

S. aureus

, and the 
typical length of the lag phase for the former microorganism 
(Refs. 23, 85, and 115). However, 70 
 F (21.1 
 C) will not fully 
control the growth of psychrotrophic pathogens. Consequently, 
further cooling from 70 
 F (21.1 
 C) to 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) within 4 
additional hours is advisable, based on the minimum growth 
temperatures of such psychrotropic pathogens as 

L. monocytogenes, 
Salmonella spp.

, and 

S. aureus

, and the lag time of 

Salmonella 
spp.

 (Refs. 23, 78, and 79). 
These cooling recommendations are generally consistent with 
those of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of USDA 
(Ref. 115) and the National Food Processors Association (NFPA) 
(Ref. 78). FDA invites comments on the specifics in App. A, 
section 6.a. In those instances where further processing takes place 
before the achievement of the 70 
 F (21.1 
 C) or the 40 
 F (4.4 

 C) temperatures, further reduction in temperature need not take 
place. There is no need for production delays when in-process 
storage times are normally less than the 2 or 6 hours needed to 
achieve each of these temperatures. 
The time/temperature parameters employed to control the 
microbiological hazards associated with cooling after cooking can 
be confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature 
monitoring (Appendix A, section 6.a.1.). Real time documentation 
of this monitoring should be done to facilitate management and 
regulatory review. 
Alternately, the ability of the firm's processing procedures 
to consistently achieve the appropriate time/temperature 
parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted 
time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range 
of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of 
processing variations include product size, e.g., the range of 
shrimp sizes that the firm typically processes; the temperature 
of the cooling medium, e.g., the highest temperature normally 
experienced in the firm's cooling unit; and the amount of product 
normally placed in the cooling unit. 
In some instances in-process time/temperature monitoring may 
be impractical or needlessly redundant, particularly in 
continuous processing systems. A scientifically conducted study 
is especially appropriate for such situations, where it can be 
assured that in all plausible situations the time/temperature 
parameters will be met. Documentation and retention of the 
conduct and results of this study is required by  123.8. 
Appendix A, section 6.b. advises how processors can ensure 
that microbiological hazards associated with postcooking 
processing can be controlled. It advises that products not be 
exposed to ambient temperatures of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or higher for 
more than 4 hours during postcooking processing, again based on 
the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as 


L. monocytogenes

 and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic 
pathogens as 

Salmonella spp.

 The agency recognizes that, for 
many products, manipulation of the product after cooking, while 
undesirable from the standpoint of microbiological 
recontamination, is necessary for many cooked, ready-to-eat 
products. It is often impractical to perform this manipulation 
under refrigerated conditions. Consequently, the product will be 
exposed to some combination of time and temperature that may 
allow for microbiological growth. The recommended conditions 
will minimize the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and the 
production of heat stable toxins (e.g., staphylococcal 
enterotoxin). 
The ability of the firm's processing procedures to 
consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be 
confirmed by monitoring the length of time that the product is 
exposed to such ambient temperatures. Documentation of 
time/temperature monitoring must be in accordance with  123.8. 
to facilitate management and regulatory review.

Appendix A, section 6.c. advises how processors can ensure 
that microbiological hazards associated with final product 
cooling can be controlled. Following the manipulation of the 
product during postcooking processing, it will be necessary for 
the processor to cool the product to a temperature that will not 
support the further growth of mesophilic or psychrotropic 
pathogens. This result can be achieved by cooling the finished 
product to an internal temperature of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) within 4 
hours of either placing it in the finished product container or 
completing pasteurization. Again, the recommendation is based on 
the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as 


L. monocytogenes

 and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic 
pathogens as 

Salmonella spp

. Of specific concern to the 
pasteurization process is the reduction of the internal 
temperature of the product to a level that will not support the 
growth of any surviving spores of 

C. botulinum

, type E. 
The ability of the firm's processing procedures to 
consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be 
confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature monitoring 
designed to address the particulars of the firm's processing 
system. Real time documentation of this monitoring should be 
done to facilitate management and regulatory review. 
Alternately, the firm's ability to consistently meet its 
parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted 
time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range 
of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of 
these processing variations include container size, the 
temperature of the cooling medium, and the amount of product 
normally placed in the cooling unit. In many instances, in-process time/temperature monitoring may be impractical
and 
expensive for sealed finished product containers. A 
scientifically conducted study is especially appropriate in such 
situations, where it can be assured that in all plausible 
situations the time/temperature constraints will be met. 
Documentation of the conduct and results of the study is required 
under proposed  123.8 to facilitate management and regulatory 
review. 
Temperature control during refrigerated storage is best 
achieved through the use of temperature indicating and recording 
devices and recordkeeping, as stated in Appendix A, section 
6.d.2. (Ref. 85). However, FDA recognizes that some processors 
may desire to manually monitor the temperature of the 
refrigeration unit, using only a temperature-indicating device 
and a logbook. When coupled with a high temperature alarm or a 
maximum-indicating thermometer, the agency feels that this 
practice represents an acceptable alternative. 
The guideline advises, in Appendix A, section 3.i., that 
HACCP plans prepared in accordance with subpart A of part 123 
will normally identify distribution as a critical control point. 
Distribution of perishable products encompasses the same hazards 
as associated with refrigerated storage. For this reason, in 
Appendix A, section 6.e., the agency is recommending a critical 
limit of an internal temperature maximum of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) and is 
encouraging the shipper and consignee to arrange for appropriate 
control measures. 
The agency recognizes that distribution patterns vary 
considerably from single shipments to pooled and multiple 
delivery shipments, from iced shipments to refrigerated 
shipments, and from shipments on the consignee's truck to 
shipments on the shipper's truck to common carrier shipments. 
Each mode presents different opportunities and impediments for 
control. 


4. Temperature Monitoring Equipment 


Processors must monitor and control the temperature of their 
refrigeration units in order to ensure that microorganisms of 
public health concern do not increase in numbers. Likewise, 
processors must control the times and temperatures of their 
thermal processes in order to ensure that the minimum thermal 
process is consistently delivered to the product. The guidelines 
address the outfitting of cooking, pasteurization, and 
refrigeration equipment with temperature indicating and recording 
devices (Appendix A, sections 4. a.2.ii. and b.2.ii., and section 
6.d.2., respectively). A temperature-recording device provides a 
complete history of the temperature throughout the thermal 
process by continuously recording it on a chart. As has been 
demonstrated for low acid canned foods, the chart itself provides 
an excellent HACCP record for the benefit of both processor and 
regulator. For this record to be meaningful, it is critical that 
the temperature-recording device sensor be installed so as to 
accurately represent the temperature of the heating or cooling 
medium.

<TEXT>
 

Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred and rendered 
inaccurate. They can be calibrated and corrected against a 
temperature-indicating device (e.g., a thermometer) quite easily, 
however. Processors should do so at least at the beginning and 
end of each production day in order to determine whether the 
instrument was accurate throughout the day's production. In this 
situation, the temperature-indicating device serves as reference 
instrument since it is much more reliable. Consequently, the 
temperature-recording device should never show a higher 
temperature than the temperature-indicating device. 


 Temperature-indicating devices are generally reliable and 
need only be calibrated upon installation and annually 
thereafter. Calibration should be against a standardized (i.e., 
traceable to the National Bureau of Standards) thermometer that 
is not subject to the rigors of the processing environment (Ref. 
85). Temperature-indicating devices must often be read under 
less than ideal plant conditions, so they should be installed in 
a location that facilitates easy reading. As with the 
temperature-recording device, the sensor on the temperature-indicating device should be installed so as to accurately

represent the temperature of the heating or cooling medium. 


 

5. Corrective Actions 


 

Appendix A, section 8. advises processors about corrective 
action steps that they should consider to comply with the 
proposed corrective action requirements in  123.7 of subpart A. 
Because the evaluation of critical limit failures relating to the 
cooking step and the terminal heat treatment step of cooked, 
ready-to-eat products may well require an understanding of the 
technical aspects of thermal process calculations, Appendix A, 
section 8. recommends additional controls to those required by 
 123.7 in this regard. Of primary importance is the 
recommendation that any corrective action other than processing 
to eliminate the hazard or destruction must be assessed by a 
competent process authority. For this purpose, a process 
authority may be a representative of the firm or may be an 
outside source, so long as the process authority has a scientific 
background that is adequate to make the assessment. 


 

6. Sanitary Zones 


 

Section 123.10 of subpart A establishes requirements for all 
processors for sanitation within the processing environment. In 
addition to these requirements, this guideline recommends in 
Appendix A, section 8. that processors of cooked, ready-to-eat 
products establish sanitary zones in their facilities. The 
agency invites comments on the merits of this concept and on 
whether it should be codified in the regulations. 


 The importance of good sanitation in the processing of 
cooked, ready-to-eat products cannot be overemphasized. While, 
as has been stated earlier, plant sanitation has no real bearing 
on human food safety for many foods, the safety of cooked, ready-to-eat products can be easily jeopardized by pathogens
that are 
introduced through poor sanitation practices. Consequently, FDA 
is recommending that processors establish sanitary zones around 
areas where products that have already been cooked are being 
handled or stored. The primary purpose of a sanitary zone is to 
physically separate insanitary objects from cooked products. 
Sanitary zones can also minimize the likelihood of airborne contamination through proper filtration and positive
air pressure 
in the zone. 


 A sanitary zone is a separation of operations by location, 
partition, air flow, or enclosed systems. In most cases, it 
requires procedural changes to minimize the risk of contamination 
but not large-scale structural changes. Canada has successfully 
incorporated the concept of sanitary zones for seafood processing 
as part of its HACCP-based inspection program (Ref. 116). 


 

K. Guideline For Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 


 

FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix B for handling of 
the species in which scombroid toxin can form. This problem is 
primarily, but not exclusively, associated with members of the 
family Scombridae. The fish involved contain significant levels 
of naturally occurring free histidine in their flesh, which 
certain bacteria can decarboxylate into histamine. Significant 
histamine levels occur when the fish are exposed after death to 
times and temperatures that permit the growth of these bacteria. 
Histamine can result in a mild to severe allergic response in 
humans. Scombrotoxin poisoning is one of the three most common 
seafood-related illnesses (Ref. 5, p. 24). The scombrotoxic 
species that have been associated with foodborne illness include 
tuna, bluefish, mahi, mackerel, sardines, herring, kahawai, 
anchovies, and marlin. 


 This HACCP guidance is intended to maximize the use of 
controls to ensure proper handling of scombrotoxic species and 
thus to minimize the possibility of a problem. It also 
recognizes the often complex pathways of movement and ownership 
through which such fish may pass. Failure to ensure safe 
handling at any point in the chain may render the fish injurious 
to health. 


 There is a basis for concern about the safety of the fish as 
soon as histamine begins to form. Once the histamine-forming 
process has begun, it is like a chain reaction. Lowering the 
temperature of, or freezing, the fish will slow or arrest the 
process, but only cooking and prevention of recontamination can 
stop it (Refs. 9 and 117). 


 The guideline describes a HACCP system that emphasizes 
reliance upon accurate recordkeeping to show continuity of proper 
handling. Accurate knowledge of the time/temperature history of 
the fish is very important in determining the likelihood that the 
fish are unsafe or may become unsafe. The guideline also calls 
for more stringent processor controls to be applied to lots for 
which records are inadequate. While this guideline is designed 
to prevent problems, nothing in it should be construed as meaning 
that the agency will not take regulatory action if it finds 
decomposed fish. 


 The guideline in Appendix B, section 2. identifies receipt 
of raw materials, which include imported shipments, as a critical 
control point for processors of scombroid toxin forming species. 
Time/temperature abuse by the fisherman can result in 
decomposition and the resultant production of histamine.

<TEXT>
 

Decomposition can also occur before the fish are removed from 
the harvest water if the fish dies in capture nets or on long 
lines. In such an event, the degree of decomposition will 
reflect the sea temperature, time in the water, and particular 
species (Ref. 118). It is not uncommon to encounter water 
temperatures of 80 
 F to 90 
 F in tropical waters, which can 
produce rapid decomposition. 


 Thus, rapid cooling of fish when they are captured is very 
important to prevent initiation of the process by which histamine 
is produced. Fish subjected to 68 
 F for periods as short as one 
day, a practice which can happen in warm climates on fishing 
vessels, will yield high levels of histamine, even if the fish 
are later stored at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 117). 


 For these reasons, the guideline advises that processors of 
fish and fishery products from scombroid toxin forming species 
must ensure that their raw materials are essentially free of 
decomposition and histamine as a result of time/temperature abuse 
that occurred before the processor received them. The guideline 
provides for three interrelated controls for the processor to 
apply with regard to raw materials. For the first processor that 
takes ownership after harvest, these are: (1) Time/temperature 
records from the harvesting vessel (Appendix B, section 3.a.1.); 
(2) organoleptic examination of the fish from the harvesting 
vessel for decomposition (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.); and (3) 
histamine analysis, if warranted by the time/temperature history 
of the fish as revealed by the time/temperature record from the 
vessel or by the results of the organoleptic examination 
(Appendix B, section 3.a.3.), or both. Time/temperature records 
from the vessel indicate whether entire lots from the vessel may 
be suspect, and thus in need of a histamine examination, because 
of unusual events on the vessel. Such records would not normally 
reveal, however, whether there are individual fish in the lot 
that may have decomposition. An organoleptic examination for 
decomposition serves to screen individual fish. It also serves 
as a way to verify the time/temperature records from the vessel 
with regard to an entire lot. If organoleptic examination 
reveals an unusually high number of fish with decomposition, the 
entire lot should be considered suspect and subjected to 
histamine analysis. 


 Appendix B, section 3.a.1. provides for how the first 
processor can take measures to determine whether the fish were 
properly harvested and handled on board the harvesting vessel. 
Certification of the mode of capture, including information on 
the time between physical capture and bringing the fish on board, 
handling techniques, and the use of temperature logs onboard the 
vessel that record that time/temperature history of the fish (for 
example, catch date and time, means and rate of cooling, storage 
temperature, and refrigerated brine or seawater temperature) 
provide documentation to the processor and to regulatory 
authorities that the fish were properly handled. Such records on 
the handling of the fish should be part of an HACCP system and 
can be used in the specific HACCP plans of processors.

The harvester's goal should be to bring the fish to an 
internal temperature of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below as soon as 
possible after the fish dies to minimize the risk of histamine 
production. Cooling fish below 59 
 F (15 
 C), and preferably 
below 50 
 F (10 
 C), greatly reduces the growth of populations of 
the bacteria that are most likely to cause histamine formation 
(Ref. 7, p. 95). Once bacterial growth has begun, temperature at 
or below 41 
 F (5 
 C) halts bacterial growth, although enzymatic 
histamine formation may slowly continue (Ref. 7, p. 95). 
Consequently, in proposed Appendix B, section 3.a.1., the agency 
is recommending a slightly lower flesh temperature of 40 
 F (4.4 

 C) or below. This temperature is consistent with 
recommendations of safe temperatures in other sections of the 
proposed regulation. Nonetheless, FDA specifically invites 
comments on the appropriateness of this temperature. 


Appendix B, section 3.a.1. recommends that the 
time/temperature history from the vessel be on a lot-by-lot basis 
and defines a lot as a discrete storage compartment on the vessel 
in keeping with industry practice. A lot typically reflects a 
day's catch. Because a boat's catch can be subject to varying 
conditions and treatment from day-to-day, the time/temperature 
records should be specific to each lot. 


If the time/temperature records suggest that, for a 
particular lot, the conditions on the vessel were likely to 
cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine 
in the fish, or if no adequate time/temperature records exist for 
that lot, the guideline provides that a representative sample of 
fish from the lot be analyzed for histamine Appendix B, section 
3.a.2.ii.B.). The samples should be collected on a statistically 
valid sample schedule because variations in time/temperature 
abuse are likely at various points in a ship's hold. 


The second control, organoleptic examination by the 
processor for decomposition, should be performed regardless of 
what the time/temperature records show (Appendix B, section 
3.a.2.). First, decomposition is a form of adulteration under 
403(a)(3) of the act. Second, as indicated earlier, an 
organoleptic examination provides a screening mechanism for 
individual fish. It is possible for the conditions on the vessel 
to be good but for some fish to develop decomposition anyway. 
Third, also as stated earlier, an examination for decomposition 
provides a way to verify the time/temperature records. 


FDA recognizes that an organoleptic examination of each fish 
can be highly impractical. Consequently, the guideline calls for 
an examination of a representative number of fish to achieve a 95 
percent certainty that the total number of fish in the lot that 
exhibit decomposition does not exceed 2.5 percent. (The 
significance of 2.5 percent is addressed in the preamble 
discussion of Appendix B, section 3. a.2.iii. and a.2.iv.) Using 
this approach, the number of fish examined will be reasonably 
close to the total number of fish, so that the goal of screening 
individual fish is preserved to the maximum extent practicable. 
Additionally, FDA expects that this representative sample will be 
large enough so as to provide a sufficient verification of the 
time/temperature records for the entire lot. 


Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides that no fish flesh 
that exhibits any organoleptically detectable decomposition 
should be used for food. Aside from the clear violation of 
402(a)(3) of the act presented by such decomposition, the public 
health risk presented by decomposition in scombrotoxin forming 
species is unacceptable. While the existence of decomposition 
does not mean that scombrotoxin is present, it does mean that a 
process has begun that can lead to the presence of scombrotoxin 
over the shelf life of the fish or fishery product. 


In some instances, e.g., large fish such as tuna, isolated 
parts of the fish will exhibit decomposition but other parts will 
be free of decomposition. FDA recognizes that it is possible to 
remove those parts of a fish that have decomposition and salvage 
the remainder. Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides for such 
reconditioning so long as a histamine examination is performed on 
the flesh that is free of decomposition. FDA believes that a 
histamine test is prudent under such circumstances to verify that 
scombrotoxin forming processes are not at work in that flesh. 


The guideline also provides for how the processor should use 
organoleptic examination and time/temperature records in tandem 
to determine whether fish or fishery products from scombroid 
forming species are fit for further processing or should first be 
subject to a histamine examination. If no decomposition is 
found, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on 
the vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute 
to, the formation of histamine in the fish, all the fish from 
that lot may be further processed or directly entered into 
commerce (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.ii.). If, as stated earlier, 
the time/temperature records are inadequate or indicate 
conditions that could cause histamine, the processor should 
always conduct a histamine analysis on a representative sample 
regardless of the decomposition findings.

If decomposition is found in less than 2.5 percent of the 
lot, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on the 
vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute to, 
the formation of histamine in the fish, Appendix B, section 
3.a.2.iii. provides that the decomposed fish should be removed in 
accordance with the procedure outlined in Appendix B, section 
3.a.2.i., but that it is not necessary to subject the lot to a 
histamine examination. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
decomposition below 2.5 percent is not significant in terms of 
the acceptability of the entire lot. Under the best conditions, 
it is possible that some fish in a large lot will experience some 
minimal decomposition. Under these circumstances, so long as the 
fish with decomposition are culled from the lot, there is no 
reason to suspect that the lot has been subject to unusual 
conditions that could cause histamine or scombrotoxin to form. 
The agency is aware that the canned tuna industry uses the 2.5 
percent value to determine whether special handling of a lot is 
warranted (Ref. 119). The canned tuna industry has concluded, 
just as FDA tentatively concludes, that levels above 2.5 percent 
represent likely exposure of the fish in a lot to conditions that 
are out of the ordinary and potentially dangerous. 


For these reasons, if the processor finds decomposition in 
more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, those fish must be 
removed from the lot, and a histamine examination needs to be 
performed on a representative sample of the remaining fish in 
that lot (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.iv.). 


It is important to recognize that where the time/temperature 
records are inadequate for all the fish on a vessel, or show poor 
conditions for all the fish from a vessel, histamine analyses 
should be performed on representative samples from each lot on 
the vessel. Although an appropriate number of fish for sampling 
could possibly be provided from a single lot, the results would 
not be representative of the vessel as a whole. 


Appendix B, section 3.a.3. describes how fish should be 
disposed of depending on the results of a histamine examination. 
In keeping with current policy, the agency expects that any fish 
that is found to have histamine above a defect action level or 
other regulatory level or limit for histamine established by FDA 
will not be used for food. Moreover, the agency expects, as 
reflected in Appendix B, section 3.a.3.i., that a finding of 
histamine over such level or limit in any fish in a lot from the 
vessel will result in the destruction of that entire lot, 
regardless of the percentage of decomposition that was 
organoleptically detected or the conditions on the vessel as 
indicated by the time/temperature records. Such a histamine 
finding strongly indicates that neither the records from the 
vessel nor the decomposition test (if the results were below 2.5 
percent) are reliable. Histamine may be present in the absence 
of organoleptically detectable decomposition. 


Similarly, the agency expects, as reflected in 
Appendix B, section 3.a.3.ii., that a finding of histamine below 
the action level, but higher than is normally found in fresh fish 
(Refs. 120 and 121), in any fish in a lot will result in the 
immediate cooking of all the fish in the lot to ensure that 
scombrotoxin will not form over the shelf life of the fish. 
Cooking stops the histamine forming process once it has started. 
Without this cooking, any elevated temperatures later in the 
distribution system or in the home can result in a rapid 
elevation of histamine levels to hazardous levels (Ref. 117, p. 
341). 


Appendix B, section 3.b. addresses raw materials controls 
that can be exercised by subsequent processors, i.e., those other 
than the first processor to take possession of scombroid toxin 
forming fish and fish products from a harvester. Assuming that 
the first processor has met its responsibilities with regard to 
raw materials as explained above, and has not caused a problem 
through improper handling during processing, subsequent 
processors should determine whether decomposition occurred during 
transfer from the previous processor. Consequently, the 
guideline provides, at Appendix B, section 3.b.1., that 
subsequent processors that do processing other than simply 
storing, should subject a representative sample of fish or fish 
products from each lot to an organoleptic examination. Any 
finding of decomposition in that sample should lead to 
organoleptic examination of the entire lot. If decomposition is 
found in more than 2.5 percent of the fish in the lot, the 
processor should perform a histamine examination on a 
representative sample of fish from the lot. These gradations are 
consistent with the expectations reflected in the guidelines for 
first processors. 


FDA has tentatively concluded these measures need not be 
taken by those who only store fish and fishery products. While 
time/temperature abuse can occur during storage, and thus 
scombroid toxin forming species must be  held  at  appropriate 
 temperatures (40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below), the hazard of 
scombrotoxin in the finished product can be controlled by those 
who own the product or manipulate it during processing.

<TEXT>
 

As suggested above, time/temperature abuse can occur during processing as well as before the raw materials are received.
It is important that processors identify critical control points and suitable controls that will protect fish and
fish products that can form scombrotoxin from time/temperature abuse. As the guideline for scombrotoxin states
in Appendix B, section 5., many of the controls for time and temperature in the guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat
products should be applicable to the processing of scombrotoxin forming species. Such handling conditions are necessary
to control histamine production. In addition, Appendix B, section 4. provides that products that are undergoing
processing not be exposed to ambient temperatures of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or higher for more than 4 hours during that processing. The agency recognizes that for many products, manipulation
under unrefrigerated conditions is necessary. The processor must be aware, however, that during such periods the
product will be exposed to conditions that can lead to histamine formation. Appendix B, section 4. describes how to
minimize this possibility. 
To comply with Appendix B, section 4., the processor should monitor the length of time that the product is exposed to
ambient temperatures of 40 
 F or higher. Documentation of the time/temperature monitoring controls will facilitate management and regulatory
review. 


L. Guideline for Product Integrity 


1. Economic Adulteration 


Economic adulteration occurs when a consumer is misled about the worth, amount, or identity of a food product and,
therefore, unknowingly pays for value not received. Economically deceptive practices in the representation of
a food's value may occur in a number of ways. Sections 402(b) and 403 of the act define the conditions and practices that
result, respectively, in the economic adulteration and misbranding of a food. In addition, the Fair Packaging and
Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1451 

et seq., 

requires that food packages and their labeling provide consumers with accurate information about the identity and
net quantity of the contents, so that consumers can make fair value comparisons among products. 
While any food may be subjected to economic adulteration or to misbranding, fish and fishery products present distinctive
characteristics and processing procedures that make them more susceptible to abusive economic practices than most
foods. The great variety of finfish, shellfish, and crustacean species, as well as the multiplicity of products prepared
from them, including fabricated surimi-based products that imitate actual seafoods, provide ample opportunity
for both inadvertent and deliberate economic adulteration and misbranding practices that result in economic loss
to the consumer. 
Most important among the characteristics that make seafoods vulnerable to abuse is the similar appearance of many
finfish, in the whole, raw state, in the form of fillets, or as ingredients. Unlike the situation with the limited types
of red meats and fowl, it is very difficult for most consumers to detect the substitution of an economically inferior
species for a more valuable one that is declared on the label or in labeling (e.g., the substitution of rockfish for
red snapper). 
Irrespective of the relative economic value of the substitute species, section 403(a)(1) of the act states that a
food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is false and misleading in any particular. More specifically,
a food is misbranded under section 403(b) of the act if it is offered for sale under the name of another food. If the substituted
fish is less valuable than the species represented on the label or labeling, the product is also adulterated under
section 402(b)(2) of the act, which states that a food shall be deemed to be adulterated if any substance has been substituted
wholly or in part therefor. Consequently, it is a clear violation of the act when a finfish, shellfish, or crustacean
is not correctly identified on its label or in its labeling. 
Furthermore, the misidentification of species may also have adverse public health consequences. Should an illness
or outbreak occur from a seafood product, it is essential for proper diagnoses and treatment that public health investigators
not be prevented from quickly identifying the exact cause or agent responsible in the food, and from tracing it back
to the correct source of the food to prevent further sale and consumption. 
For example, in a seafood related incident that occurred in 1982, in New York, two men became ill shortly after eating
a fish dinner in a restaurant. Species substitution caused investigators to erroneously suspect that the illnesses
were caused by ciguatoxin because the food was identified as being red snapper, a species which could cause that illness.
The food actually was mahi, a fish which is often associated with scombroid poisoning (Ref. 122). Scombroid poisoning
is associated with high levels of histamine.

<TEXT>
 

FDA found that the fish mislabeled as red snapper had been shipped from Ecuador and processed in Panama. Had the fish
been labeled as mahi, it would not have been permitted entry into the United States because FDA had an automatic detention
for mahi from Ecuador at the time because of problems with high levels of histamine. 
Another instance involving species substitution resulting in a negative public health consequence occurred in
Hawaii in 1987. Fifty illnesses, 32 of which required medical attention, were attributed to the consumption of limpets
misbranded as ``Baby Abalone.'' The symptoms displayed were those of a histamine-type reaction. Because abalone
is not one of the species expected to form histamine, substituting limpets for abalone put consumers at risk from a
food that they had not intended to eat. Thus, accurate identification of species is essential to public health protection
and prompt accurate diagnosis and treatment of illness when that protection fails. 
Processing practices traditionally used in the seafood industry also are easily abused to increase a product's weight,
in the form of ice or water. For instance, frozen fillets, shrimp, crab legs, and other products are normally protected
from dehydration (freezer burn) while frozen by the application of a light glaze of ice. A packer then includes added
product in the package to compensate for the weight of the glaze. Excessive amounts of glaze, however, not compensated
for in this manner, can deliberately be used to increase the apparent weight, and therefore the apparent value, of
the product delivered. Percentage weight increases from overglazing are most dramatic for foods with high surface
area to volume ratios, such as shrimp. Overglazing is a practice that violates section 402(b)(4) of the act because
a substance has been added to increase a food's weight or to make it appear of greater value than it is. 
A similar type of fraud frequently results from oversoaking fish and shellfish meats in dip solutions. Dip solutions
are customarily used to retard the natural loss of moisture (drip loss) from products such as scallops, which are particularly
susceptible to drip loss. However, exposure to the dip may deliberately be prolonged to add weight in the form of water.
Dip solutions may contain chemicals, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, that can greatly enhance the amount of water
absorbed by the scallops. The net effect of such practices is to mislead the consumer into purchasing added water at
scallop prices. 
Seafoods generally represent a high dollar value per unit weight compared with other foods, particularly crab, lobster,
shrimp, and certain shellfish. Thus, even relatively modest percentage weight increases from abusive glazing or
water uptake from dip solutions represent a substantial loss of value to the consumer. 
For the same reason, the potential fraudulent profit from similar practices of adding less valuable ingredients,
such as breading on shrimp and fish sticks or water to shucked oysters, to increase the size or weight of products are
enticing to unscrupulous processors.

The agency believes that economic adulteration occurs with 
sufficient frequency in various seafood products to result in 
substantial losses to the consumer. Evidence of such economic 
adulteration usually comes to light indirectly, as a result of 
investigations that are carried out for other purposes. 



Fourteen and one-half percent of the samples of seafoods 
reported in 1986 as having adverse findings by eight FDA district 
offices were so listed because of product misrepresentation (Ref. 
123). 



Similarly, FDA found that in fiscal years 1991 and 1992, 
14.8 and 11.7 percent, respectively, of all consumer complaints 
involved complaints of economic problems (Ref. 60). 



Imported seafood products also are subject to significant 
levels of economic misrepresentation. In 1992, approximately 13 
percent of all detentions of imported seafood involved some form 
of misbranding, such as false or misleading labeling, short fill, 
short weight, standard of identity, and omitted labeling (Ref. 
124). 



Specific data on species substitution are available from The 
National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL) of NMFS, Department 
of Commerce. Data gathered for the 3-year period of 1990-1992 by 
the laboratory in conducting species verification tests requested 
by industry show that 59 percent of the samples labeled as cod, 
57 percent of the product labeled as haddock, 56 percent of the 
product labeled as flounder or sole, and 51 percent of the 
product labeled as red snapper were not the species claimed on 
the label. While these data cannot be regarded as representative 
of industry-wide misbranding practices because the testing was 
not random, the results indicate a remarkably high incidence of 
species substitution. Moreover, these findings are consistent 
with other surveys (Ref. 35, p. 45). 



For example, a survey conducted in Florida to determine the 
extent of retail species substitution in the case of red snapper 
found that 64 percent of the fish fillets labeled for retail sale 
as red snapper were misbranded (Ref. 125). The prevalence of 
misbranding just this one desirable species is underscored by the 
observation: ``If all of the red snapper sold in the United 
States were genuine, the seas would long since have been swept 
absolutely clean of this species'' (Ref. 126, p. 41). 



While most States' regulations follow FDA nomenclature 
policy and regulations, misbranding practices are exacerbated by 
the failure of some States to require these common names for some 
species sold within the State. Red snapper again provides a case 
study in the extent of variation in acceptable nomenclature 
allowed for a species. Although not permitted when sold in 
interstate commerce, California regulations allow 12 species of 
rockfish to be labeled as ``Pacific red snapper'' within the State. 
Similarly, Oregon and Washington regulations also allow rockfish 
to be called ``snapper'' (Ref. 126, p. 305). Moreover, an even 
greater variety of imported species may be misrepresented as ``red 
snapper.''

Many in the seafood industry believe that economic abuse is 
one its most significant problems. A survey conducted by the 
National Fisheries Institute found that the Institute's 
membership supported mandatory inspection as a means of 
overcoming practices that pose a threat to the reputation of 
processors and packers adhering to scrupulous practices in the 
representation of their products (Ref. 127). General agreement 
was found to exist among processors, distributors, and importers, 
as well as retailers and restaurateurs, that abusive economic 
practices are widespread, including overglazing and overbreading 
of fishery products, inaccurate net weight measurement, and the 
substitution of inferior species for more valuable fish. 



In a similar industry study by the Southeastern Fisheries 
Association, members ranked problems with economic fraud (such as 
species identification, overglazing, and the use of phosphates) 
above all other seafood industry problems, except vessel handling 
practices (Ref. 128). 




2. Recommended Adoption of HACCP-Based Methods 





Although the agency recognizes that HACCP was developed 
primarily to address safety, FDA believes that the proposed 
requirement in  123.6, for seafood processors to adopt HACCP 
methods to ensure the safety of seafoods provides an opportunity 
for processors to develop and apply effective control point 
procedures that they can use to ensure that seafoods comply with 
the provisions of sections 402(b) and 403 of the act, The Fair 
Packaging and Labeling Act, the seafood standards of identity 
promulgated in 21 CFR, and applicable compliance policy guides 
issued by the agency (Compliance Policy Guides 7108.01, 7108.03, 
7108.04, 7108.12, 7108.13, 7108.14, 7108.21, and 7108.23). 
Consequently, the agency is proposing in Appendix D to establish 
a guideline for HACCP-based procedures to avoid economic 
adulteration and misbranding of seafoods. Following this 
guideline will enable processors to develop procedures and 
records that will establish that they are not engaged in any 
practices that would render their products economically 
adulterated. Clearly, however, guidelines cannot prevent 
economic fraud. 



The following guideline for product integrity lists critical 
control points covering raw material receipt, processing, and 
labels and labeling that processors and importers can incorporate 
in their HACCP plans. The agency believes that proper control 
begins with verification of the raw materials received by a 
processor. Therefore, in Appendix D, section 2.a., the agency is 
suggesting that, as part of their HACCP plan, processors and 
importers should include critical control points beginning with 
the receipt of raw materials. Ensuring that raw materials meet 
critical limits (e.g., correct species identification, net 
weight, additive identification) at the point they enter a 
processor's or importer's control is crucial. 



There are a number of ways to ensure that species are 
properly identified. Physical examination, as indicated in 
Appendix D, section 2.a.1. is the typical method of determining 
the identity of a species. The agency believes that most seafood 
processors and importers are knowledgeable about the species that 
they handle and would have personnel available at the point of 
receipt who could monitor the incoming shipments for species 
substitution. Expert consultation is another option for 
correctly identifying species. 



Processors or importers can also check the identity of 
seafood by employing laboratory services, as provided for in 
Appendix D, section 2.a.2. Protein chromatography is a 
laboratory method that can accurately establish the species of 
fish and fishery products (Ref. 50). Another option, Appendix D, 
section 2.a.3., is to receive raw materials certified by 
suppliers under either limited or general and continuing 
guaranties (section 303(c)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)(2)) 
and 21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13). 



In Appendix D, section 2.b., the agency points out that 
processors must ensure that the labels, labeling, and invoices of 
their finished products accurately list weight, count, size, and 
product identity, as well as the content of valuable constituents 
(i.e., that ingredient that the consumer identifies as providing 
the reason to purchase the product, for example, the shrimp in 
breaded shrimp). The content of the valuable constituents must 
be maintained as required by FDA's standards of identity 
regulations (21 CFR part 161, including: oysters, Pacific 
salmon, canned wet packed shrimp in transparent or nontransparent 
containers, frozen raw breaded shrimp, frozen raw lightly breaded 
shrimp, and canned tuna) or in accordance with FDA's compliance 
policy guides. 



More specifically, as in Appendix D, section 2.b.1., the 
species must be correctly identified by its common or usual name 
and be so represented on the label and labeling. To assist 
processors and consumers, FDA has developed both printed and 
database versions of the ``FDA Fish List'' to provide such 
guidance. Also specific requirements for such labeling are 
listed in Standards of Identity and the Common or Usual Name 
regulations (21 CFR, parts 161 and 102). 



Appendix D, sections 2.b.2. through b.5. are based on 
section 402(b) of the act. Under Appendix D, section 2.b.2., the 
processor needs to ensure that valuable constituents of the 
product are not omitted or abstracted. For example, breaded 
shrimp must contain the required weight ratio of shrimp to 
breading. Similarly, shrimp must be of the size and/or weight 
specified on the label or labeling.

Under Appendix D, section 2.b.3., the processor needs to 
ensure that no substance is substituted wholly or in part for a 
valuable constituent. For example, substitution of crab flavored 
surimi cannot be used in whole or in part instead of crab meat in 
a product labeled as crab cake. 

Under Appendix D, section 2.b.4., the processor needs to 
ensure that damage or inferiority is not concealed in any manner. 
This means, for example, that bleaching or coloring of product to 
conceal its true nature or condition of wholesomeness is not 
acceptable.

M. Additional Guidance_FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide Including Specific Guidance on
Smoked Fishery Products



As an adjunct to its rulemaking to require HACCP procedures 
in the seafood industry, FDA is drafting an extensive guidance 
for processors to use in understanding and implementing HACCP 
principles for their operations. This guidance will provide 
information that processors and importers can use in the 
development of their HACCP plans. This information consists 
largely of an identification of hazards that can affect the 
safety of seafood and a review of control measures that can keep 
the hazards from actually occurring, or that can at least 
minimize the likelihood of their occurrence. 

FDA has included selected portions of the draft HACCP 
guidance as Appendix 1 to this proposal, so as to better inform 
the public about how this guidance will be structured and about 
the kinds of assistance that will be available to processors and 
importers who implement HACCP. The agency emphasizes, however, 
that this guidance is a work-in-progress and still being developed by FDA. Nonetheless, the agency seeks comment
on the 
need for this guidance and the usefulness of the format the 
agency proposes to adopt. 

In addition, FDA is including in Appendix 1 specific 
guidance on time-temperature and salinity parameters and other 
matters for use in the HACCP plans of processors of smoked and 
smoke-flavored fishery products. While FDA is seeking comment on 
the guidance generally, it particularly seeks comment on the 
guidance on smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. Material 
relevant to the safe processing of smoked and smoke-flavored 
fishery products is found in various sections of the HACCP 
guidance because this general guidance is primarily organized by 
hazard rather than by commodity type. However, the agency has 
gathered the materials relating to smoked and smoke-flavored 
fishery products into a single section of the guidance to 
facilitate use of this guidance by this industry, and to 
facilitate obtaining public comment on it. As stated above, FDA 
seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the materials 
relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products as 
guidance, on their validity as guidelines, and on whether they 
should be made mandatory by incorporating them into any final 
regulation that results from this rulemaking. 

While no known outbreaks of botulism attributed to smoked 
fish have been reported since 1963, FDA believes that the failure 
by manufacturers to obtain information about the composition of 
hot- and cold-process products represents a potential health hazard. Without analytical results from the testing
for 
water-phase salt and sodium nitrite levels, a manufacturer cannot 
determine whether the fish have been adequately processed to 
inhibit 

C. botulinum 

spore outgrowth and toxin production. The 
agency's concerns are underscored by the diversity of processing 
temperatures and salt levels used in the manufacture of these 
products, particularly the lower range temperatures and 
water-phase salt levels (Ref. 24). 

Finally, as stated above, the use of modified atmosphere and 
vacuum packaging with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products is 
also a source of concern. These types of packaging provide an 
anaerobic environment in which

 C. botulinum

 spores can grow out 
and produce botulin, the causative agent in botulism. When 
consumed, the toxin attacks the central nervous system and may 
cause death if untreated within 3 to 6 days. 

For all these reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that 
some type of guidance that defines the procedures for the safe 
processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fish is necessary. 

Historically, fish have been smoked in order to preserve 
them. Today, the primary reason for smoking is to impart certain 
taste and texture qualities to the fish. There are essentially 
two types of smoked fish: (1) Those that are subjected to a 
``cold process'' that leaves the fish soft and moist, with a 
delicate smoke flavor, such as lox, and (2) those that are 
subjected to a ``hot process'' that produces a less moist, firmer 
product with heavier smoke flavor, such as smoked whitefish.

<TEXT>
 

The processing of these fish basically involves: (1) 
Cleaning and gutting followed by (2) immersion in a brine 
solution or dry salt in order to salt them, (3) drying in a cool 
temperature to avoid bacterial growth, (4) smoking in a smoking 
chamber at a temperature and for a time necessary to achieve the 
desired ``cold process'' or ``hot process'' effect, and (5) 
packaging and cooling. The taste and texture qualities 
attributable to ``cold process'' smoked fish require much lower 
temperatures during the smoking phase of the process than those 
attributable to ``hot process.'' Salted fish may not be smoked at 
all. 
As with virtually all fish, the species used to make smoked 
fish are exposed during their lives to 

C. botulinum

, a spore- 
forming bacterium that is ubiquitous in the marine and freshwater 
environment. Type E is the predominant type of 

C. botulinum

 
found in fish, other aquatic animals, water, and sediment, 
although other types such as A, proteolytic and nonproteolytic B, 
C, D, and F also have been found in fish (Refs. 148 through 152). 
The concentration of 

C. botulinum

 spores that may be expected in 
and on a naturally contaminated fish is unknown, although it is reported to vary from one spore per 16 g of fish to one
spore per 
200 g (Refs. 153 and 180). 
Under certain conditions, 

C. botulinum

 can produce a toxin 
that causes botulism, a disease that attacks the central nervous 
system of humans and can cause death within 3 to 6 days of 
ingestion if not properly treated (Ref. 193). 

C. botulinum's

 
ability to form spores means that in a dormant state, it can 
survive environments that are otherwise hostile to it. 

C. 
botulinum

 is ``anaerobic,'' meaning that air constitutes a hostile 
environment. When conditions become favorable, that is, when no 
air is present, the spores experience ``outgrowth'' during which 
toxin can be produced. In fish, 

C. botulinum

 spores are found in 
the intestines and can also adhere to the surface of fish. 
For these reasons, 

C. botulinum

 can be found in the 
environment of most any fish processor and cannot be totally 
eliminated using reasonable means. Moreover, even though a fish 
might be cleaned, gutted, and air packaged, some risk will still 
exist because 

C. botulinum

 spores can find their way into muscle 
tissue during processing. Muscle tissue below the surface of the 
fish can provide an anaerobic environment where outgrowth and 
toxin production can occur if time and temperature permit. 
Although the processing procedures in Appendix 1 are based 
on studies of the time-temperature and salinity conditions 
required to prevent the outgrowth of botulinum spores, these 
practices are also effective in the elimination of risk from 
other pathogenic bacteria such as 

L. monocytogenes. L. 
monocytogenes

 is a pathogenic bacterium that is widespread in the 
environment and that is commonly isolated from surface waters and 
other environmental samples. Thus the likelihood of finding this 
pathogen on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. 
Since 1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have 
been linked to the consumption of contaminated foods (Refs. 130, 
131, and 132), thereby demonstrating the etiologic importance of 
foodborne transmission of this disease in humans. 
Although listeriosis is a relatively rare illness 
(approximately 2,000 reported cases per year in the United 
States), the exceptionally high mortality rate, as high as 34 
percent, makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne 
diseases in the United States. The highest incidence of 
listeriosis generally occurs in neonates, the elderly, pregnant 
women, and individuals suffering from compromised immune systems. 
However, there are instances in which apparently healthy 
individuals have contracted listeriosis (Refs. 130 and 133). 
The incidence of 

Listeria

 species (including 

L. 
monocytogenes

) in frozen raw and cooked seafood products is 
reportedly as high as 61 percent (Ref. 136). Indeed, numerous 
seafood products have been shown to support growth of 

L. 
monocytogenes

 (Refs. 137 and 138). 

L. monocytogenes

 is capable 
of prolific growth on smoked salmon stored at 4 
 C, even when 
test inocula as low as 6 organisms per gram (g) are applied to 
the surface of fish samples (Ref. 139). Seafoods other than 
smoked or smoke-flavored fish have been epidemiologically linked 
to two outbreaks and one sporadic case of listeriosis (Ref. 140). 
Furthermore, several cooked seafood products have been recalled 
from the market in North America because of contamination with 

L. 
monocytogenes

, but these crises did not involve smoked or smoke- 
flavored fish products.

A recent survey of smoked fish and smoked fish products in 
Iceland has shown that 29 percent of samples tested were 
contaminated with 

Listeria

 species, including 

L. monocytogenes

 
(Ref. 141). Another survey revealed that 8.9 percent and 13.6 
percent of hot- and cold-smoked fish, respectively, were 
contaminated with 

L. monocytogenes

 (Ref. 142). Cold-smoked fish 
may pose a significant health risk, particularly when stored for 
extended periods. When raw salmon was inoculated with known 
populations of 

L. monocytogenes

 and smoked at 78.8 to 86 
 F (26 
to 30 
 C) for 6 hours, and the finished product stored at 39.2 
and 50 
 F (4 and 10 
 C) for up to 30 days, investigators observed 
substantial increases in 

L. monocytogenes

 populations at both 
incubation temperatures (Ref. 143). No known cases of listeriosis have been linked to smoked seafood consumption
in the 
United States. 
In contrast, studies have shown that properly controlled 
hot-smoking processes effectively eliminate 

L. monocytogenes

 
contamination (Ref. 144). In raw trout inoculated with high doses of 

L. monocytogenes

, stored for 12 hours in a marinade 
containing 10 percent NaCl, and then subjected to a hot-smoke 
process (dried for 30 minutes at 140 
 F (60 
 C), cooked at 230 
 F 
(110 
 C) until an internal temperature of 149 
 F (65 
 C) was 
maintained for 20 minutes, and finally smoked for 45 minutes at 
140 
 F), 

L. monocytogenes

 did not survive the smoking process. 
However, when fish were inoculated after smoking and stored at 
46.4 to 50 
 F (8 to 10 
 C), a significant increase in 

L. 
monocytogenes

 populations was observed after up to 20 days of 
storage. These findings further emphasize the importance of 
preventing the contamination of processed fish. 
Studies have also shown the importance of controlling the 
salt concentration in smoked fish. Although 

L. monocytogenes

 can 
survive in environments containing up to 20 percent NaCl (Ref. 
145), it has been demonstrated that the organism becomes 
increasingly more sensitive to NaCl when it is exposed to heat 
processing (Ref. 146). 
Because of the prevalence of 

L. monocytogenes

 in the 
environment, it may be impossible to completely eliminate the 
organism from all foods. However, use of the sanitary practices 
and processing practices proposed in this document should prevent 
cross-contamination and growth of the organism in smoked and 
smoke-flavored seafoods. 
Smoking fish is a delicate process, involving a number of 
interrelated variables including times, temperatures, and 
exposure to smoke, salt, and sodium nitrite, when used. However, 
FDA believes that, by its very nature, this process involves 
certain inherent risks, risks that, if not attended to, can have 
very significant consequences. 
For example, the times/temperatures involved in the ``hot 
process'' can injure but not kill

 C. botulinum

 spores while 
killing spoilage microorganisms. Thus, during the period when 
the spoilage microorganisms are becoming reestablished, surviving 


C. botulinum

 spores would be presented with an optimum growth 
environment because of the lack of competition. Yet, because of 
the absence of spoilage microorganisms, spoilage odors that would 
warn consumers away from potentially dangerous products would not 
be present. Botulism toxin alone is not detectable by sensory 
examination. 
In addition, because of the number and types of steps 
involved, the processing of smoked fish involves an unusual 
amount of handling of the product relative to other seafood 
processing procedures. Increased handling presents increased 
opportunities for contamination during the process than would 
otherwise be the case.

The finished product also is inherently more risky than most other seafood products because it is a ready-to-eat product
that is generally not cooked before eating. However, the present evidence indicates that smoked fish has caused no
more cases of botulism in the United States than any other type of seafood product. In contrast, fresh fillets that
are not smoked are intended to be cooked before consumption. Cooking is lethal to bacteria and will deactivate botulism
toxin. Thus, smoked fish products usually do not get the benefit of an additional processing step that protects against
most bacteriological risks.
In addition to these inherent characteristics, FDA believes that smoked fish present special risks because both
domestic and foreign processors are now using vacuum packaging to a substantial extent_much more so than are other
segments of the seafood industry. A 1988-1989 FDA and New York State survey of domestic processing plants, for
example, showed that 45 percent of the firms visited vacuum-packaged smoked fish. However, there is no evidence to
show a linkage between vacuum packaging of smoked fish and illness in the 5 years since this survey was completed.
An economic incentive for use of vacuum packaging is the extended shelf-life of the product, made possible by the anaerobic
environment in the package that prevents the growth of some spoilage microorganisms and slows the growth of others.
Because this anaerobic environment cannot prevent spoilage altogether, vacuum-packaged products must still be
refrigerated.
Unfortunately, the anaerobic environment greatly favors the outgrowth of any 

C. botulinum

 spores that may be present over the development of telltale spoilage microorganisms. Thus, 

C. botulinum

 outgrowth can occur before spoilage if a vacuum-packaged product is temperature abused, i.e., not refrigerated.
Moreover, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the growth of 

L. monocytogenes

 and 

C. botulinum

 type E and nonproteolytic type B is possible even at refrigeration temperatures below 40 
 F (4.4 
 C). FDA believes that strict controls are needed to overcome this risk.
In 1970, FDA issued a final rule for smoked fish in response to outbreaks of botulism attributed to vacuum-packaged
smoked fish products (35 FR 17401, November 13, 1970). Among other things, the rule attempted to control the risk of
botulism by setting conservative processing parameters for time, temperature, and salinity that would minimize
the opportunity for 

C. botulinum

 spore outgrowth. These parameters were based on the relatively limited research that had been conducted up to that
time with one species of fish. Many processors claimed that these parameters would have resulted in a product that
was too salty and too dry in texture to be marketable.
The rule was overturned in court due to procedural problems (

United States

 v. 

Nova Scotia Food Products Corp.

, 568 F.2d 240 (2d Cir. 1977)). However, in rethinking this rule after the remand, FDA decided that research was needed
into the relationships among time, temperature, and salinity to develop processing parameters that would provide
safety without producing an undesirable product that consumers would not buy.

This research has been successfully conducted by FDA, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the industry. FDA
has prepared the time, temperature, and salinity parameters in the Hazard Assessment Guide based on the results of
this research.


1. Need for Guidance


FDA routinely inspects smoked fish processing establishments for sanitary conditions using the guidance in 21 CFR
part 110, ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Human Food'' (Ref. 196) and
in the FDA Inspection Operations Manual, Chapter 5, Establishment Inspection and section 616.6 Smoked Fish inspection
methods (Ref. 197). In addition to the Establishment Inspection Reports (EIR's) discussed in section G, EIR's for
smoked fish processing establishments over the past few years (1985 to the present) show evidence that the use of manufacturing
procedures are not in line with CGMP's. The EIR's also show that processing parameters and controlled processing
and storage techniques, commonly recognized as appropriate in the industry (Ref. 182) are not being used (Ref. 169).
Typical observations by FDA officials in these inspections include: (1) Live flies in production areas providing
a vehicle for contamination and recontamination of products; (2) standing water in production rooms providing a
medium for microbial growth and contamination from splashed water; (3) utensils not sanitized prior to use; (4) open
bags of raw materials in storage areas exposing products to flying insects and potential microbial contamination;
(5) smoke racks encrusted with pieces of fish from previous processes, thus providing an opportunity for microbial
growth; (6) refrigerators being used for both raw and finished products, thus providing an environment for microbial
growth through cross-contamination between unprocessed and processed products; (7) overcrowded fish in brine
tanks, whereby some fish are not fully submerged in brine, resulting in lower and uneven levels of salt uptake that
would not be effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth; (8) salinity and microbiologic testing not performed on products;
(9) low minimum water-phase salt levels (0.88 to 1.79 percent) that would not inhibit 

C. botulinum

 spore outgrowth and toxin production; and (10) poor employee practices that foster microbial contamination, including
spitting into sinks adjacent to sinks used to thaw product, not washing or sanitizing hands, and street clothes in
contact with product (Ref. 169). (See also Ref. 200.)
As part of its Fiscal Year (FY) 91 Domestic Fish and Fishery Products Inspection Assignment, FDA conducted food safety
inspections of smoked fish establishments. These inspections revealed a continuing pattern of problems in these
facilities. In over half of these inspections FDA found violations that required action, ranging from minor violations,
which are normally handled by informing the firm's official during the inspection, to more serious violations that
prompted some form of official agency action (Ref. 200).
In addition, several States, working through AFDO, have expressed concern that a potential health hazard exists
with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products and have stated that a Federal regulation is necessary for uniform regulation
of the production and distribution of these foods (Refs. 170 and 189). AFDO is an organization of Federal, State, and
local regulatory officials with membership representing all 50 states, as well as FDA and other Federal agencies.
AFDO's Central States Regional organization held a meeting in 1988, attended by public health officials from 6 states
in which the smoked fish industry is concentrated, Canada, and NMFS, to discuss a Federal regulation governing the
processing, storage, and distribution of smoked and smoke-flavored fish products. In December, 1989, AFDO first
passed a resolution requesting that FDA expedite the rulemaking process to establish uniform Federal regulations
to ensure that safe smoked fish processing methods are utilized for fish products sold in the United States. In December,
1990, AFDO passed resolution 8, which strongly encouraged FDA to ``accelerate the promulgation of smoked fish CGMP's
so that concerned States can move forward with their efforts to ensure the safety of smoked fish'' (Ref. 170). FDA recognizes
the need to address the hazards associated with smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products and therefore is setting
forth the procedures in Appendix 1 in the interest of protecting the public health.

The need for some type of agency guidance on smoked fish is 
also evidenced by several other factors. First, the 1970 final 
rule, which covered only hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish and the processing parameters that they required,
is still 
being used as a guideline by some States. These earlier 
parameters could result in commercially undesirable products. 
These parameters ought to be updated with the current 
technological understanding and processing flexibility for both 
hot and cold smoked products. The guidance in this document can 
provide the basis on which such updating can occur. 
Second, the manufacture or sale of cold-processed fish 
products is not permitted in at least two States because there 
are no regulations or regulatory guidelines for these products 
(Ref. 170). There is some pressure, however, to permit the sale 
of these products. The Canadian Government, for example, has 
urged these States, Minnesota and Michigan, to permit the sale of 
these products so that Canadian products may be exported to the 
United States (Ref. 170). Some type of guidance that helps to 
define the processing parameters and techniques that reduce human 
health risks from cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish 
products would provide State, as well as federal, public health 
officials with the tools necessary to evaluate the safety of cold 
processed products manufactured in the United States, as well as 
those imported into the United States. 
Third, in 1988 FDA conducted a survey of processing 
parameters used by fish smoking plants in the United States. 
Seventy five percent of the firms surveyed did not do final 
product testing to ascertain whether their products met commonly recognized (Ref. 182) parameters for their products
(Ref. 24). 
The information collected in this survey augmented information 
obtained from the New York State Department of Agriculture and 
Marketing (Ref. 24), which had conducted a similar survey of fish 
smoking establishments in that State at approximately the same 
time. A total of 64 establishments were surveyed by FDA and New 
York State, representing over 90 percent of the smoked fish 
manufacturers in the United States. Among the species of fish 
included in the survey were chubs, bluefish, trout, carp, salmon, 
whitefish, and herring. Processing information was collected 
from manufacturers, and samples were collected for laboratory 
analysis.

The following chart summarizes the results of these surveys 
and compares them to proposed processing parameters:

Oven temperatures for hot processing ranged from 90 to 240 

 F (32 to 116 
 C) and from 38 to 125 
 F (4.4 to 52 
 C) for cold 
processing. Water-phase salt content in hot-process products 
ranged from 0.88 to 27.5 percent and in cold-process products 
from 1.33 to 18.1 percent. Twenty-eight firms (43.7 percent) 
vacuum packed cold-process products, but 60.7 percent of those 
firms did not test final products for water-phase salt content or 
for residual sodium nitrite. Twenty-five firms (39.1 percent) 
vacuum packed hot-process products, but 68 percent of those firms 
did not test final products for water-phase salt content or for 
residual sodium nitrite. Seventy-five percent of the firms 
surveyed did not test final products for water-phase salt content 
or for residual sodium nitrite, where used. Since this survey 
was conducted, the frequency of FDA inspections of smoked fish 
establishments has been increased over 50 percent each year. 

Therefore, FDA is providing guidance on the appropriate 
parameters for processing smoked fishery products in Appendix 1 
to this document. 


The guidance addresses critical control points that apply to 
these products as a class and that will typically be identified 
in the HACCP plans of most processors of smoke and smoke-flavored 
products. The guidance also addresses ways of controlling 
hazards at these critical control points. 

The key processing parameters that must be controlled to 
ensure the safety of these products involve time, temperature, 
and salinity. While a range of time-temperature-salinity (TTS) 
values will provide a safe product, there are now known safety 
minimums for these values that have been developed through years 
of research. Processors whose TTS values fall below these 
minimums do not produce a safe product and shift much of the 
burden of preventing botulism toxin outgrowth to those who take 
possession of these products after they leave the processing 
plant, including the ultimate consumer. This burden includes, 
among other things, maintaining strict temperature control at 
40 
 F or lower even though it is known that many commercial and 
home refrigerators are unable to maintain this temperature (Ref. 
201). 

These TTS minimums are known to produce a marketable 
product, because there are processors that operate in conformance 
with them. Moreover, because they are minimums, these values 
allow for the production of a variety of products, such as 
different types of lox with varying amounts of saltiness, to suit 
different tastes. 

These minimum TTS values provide the only scientifically 
valid way developed to date of ensuring that no botulism toxin 
will be produced over the shelf life of the product under proper 
refrigeration conditions or under conditions of moderate 
temperature abuse. The minimum values, coupled with the 
sanitation practices proposed in this document, should also 
ensure against the presence of detectable 

L. monocytogenes. 

These minimum TTS values are being issued at this time as 
proposed guidance to ensure maximum flexibility. If these values 
are reflected in the HACCP plans that are required by proposed 
subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, and are being effectively 
implemented by the processor, the agency is likely to find that 
the plan and its implementation are adequate with regard to those 
critical limits and critical control points. The same holds true 
for the other types of controls recommended in the guidance. 

The agency is requesting comment on this approach, and on 
the following alternatives: 

(1) Issue all or part of the materials relating to smoked 
and smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 as regulations, 
rather than guidance. Given the public health concerns 
associated with these products and the scientific basis for the 
TTS minimums, it may well be appropriate to issue them as 
regulations. Such regulations would take into account advances 
in knowledge and technology by allowing processors to use 
alternative processing parameters so long as these alternatives were scientifically demonstrated to produce an
equivalent level 
of safety. (Section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and 
smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 contains such a 
feature.) 

(2) Issue a performance standard as a regulation, while 
leaving the materials in Appendix 1 as guidelines on how 
processors could meet the performance standard. The likely 
performance standard would be, as suggested above (and included 
in section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and smoke- 
flavored fishery products in Appendix 1): (a) for botulism, zero 
toxin production in the product during a time period through_and 
slightly beyond_the shelf life of the product, demonstrated 
through inoculated pack studies under normal and moderate abuse 
conditions; and (b) no detectable L. monocytogenes 

in the final 
product. 

(3) Maintain the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products in the FDA Fish and Fishery Products

Hazards and Controls Guide and control safety through the HACCP 
requirements for all seafood in proposed subpart A. 

FDA requests comment on which of these alternatives is most 
likely to ensure that smoked fish will be safe and is most 
consistent with the agency's obligations under the act. In the 
absence of a regulation or guideline, how can the agency best 
ensure that the results of the research that it has conducted 
will be available for use by the industry? FDA solicits comments 
on these and the matters raised above. 



N. Verification Issues 



As described in section IV.A. of this document, one of the 
NACMCF's seven HACCP principles involves verification that the 
HACCP system is working. NACMCF recommends that HACCP plans 
include procedures for verification of the HACCP system (Ref. 34, 
p. 200). FDA advises processors to consider adopting this 
recommendation, but has not proposed to require it because the 
agency expects verification to occur through: (1) A firm's 
consistency with the controls and limits to be provided by FDA in 
the HACCP guidance described in section VII.C. and M. of this 
document; (2) third-party technical assistance provided through 
trade associations, universities and government agencies; and (3) 
review of all HACCP monitoring records by trained individuals 
before distribution of product (see proposed  123.8(b)); the 
proposed corrective action requirements (see proposed  123.7), 
especially the provision for assessment of HACCP plans as a 
consequence of deviations ( 123.7(a)(4)); the recommended use of 
process authorities for cooked, ready-to-eat products (see 
Appendix A); the proposed general training requirements (see 
proposed  123.9); and inspector review during routine agency 
inspections. FDA invites comment on whether this approach is 
adequate to ensure that the NACMCF verification principle is 
being properly addressed, both for individual firms and for the 
overall HACCP program. 

For individual firms, NACMCF specifically discourages the sole reliance on end-product sampling for verification
purposes 
(Ref. 34, p. 201). FDA also has questions concerning the 
efficacy of end-product sampling as the only way to measure the 
success of HACCP. These caveats notwithstanding, FDA invites 
comment on what tests should be used to measure success, both in 
terms of individual firms and the program as a whole, and how 
frequently such tests should be administered. 



VIII. Other Approaches to HACCP 



This preamble has described in great detail the HACCP system 
that is being proposed and the reasoning behind each proposed 
provision. While the agency is inviting comment on the merits of 
each provision, FDA also invites comment on the overall system, 
including whether some other approach to HACCP or some variation 
of the proposed approach might be preferable. Variations on the 
proposed approach include, but are not limited to: (1) 
Requiring HACCP only for higher risk seafood products; (2) 
exempting small firms from HACCP requirements; (3) staggering the 
effective date for implementation based on size of firm or risk; 
and (4) deleting or altering some of the requirements in this 
proposal in order to facilitate implementation and lower costs. 
A brief discussion of each of these variations follows: 



A. Higher Risk Only 



An alternative to requiring HACCP for all commercial seafood 
products would be to require it for products or processes that 
have been linked to significant numbers reported seafood-borne 
illnesses. As section II.B. of this document explains in detail, 
many of the reported illnesses from seafood involve raw molluscan 
shellfish and certain species of finfish that can accumulate 
scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin. Other seafood products cause 
illness but are not as commonly reported. FDA invites comment on 
whether this proposed regulation should apply only to molluscan 
shellfish and the species responsible for scombrotoxin and 
ciguatoxin poisonings. 

A variation on this approach would be to have the proposed 
regulation apply to those species and processes with a higher 
potential for harm, even if actual illnesses from them cannot be 
documented from the foodborne illness reporting system. As 
described earlier in the preamble, the fact that the system is 
not recording illnesses from a particular food does not mean that 
illnesses are not occurring. Also, potential for harm need not 
always be measured in terms of the number of illnesses that are 
actually occurring. For example, some problems, like botulism, 
may occur infrequently, but when they do, the consequences can be 
devastating. Based on the potential for harm, other candidates 
for inclusion would be: (1) Hot-process smoked and hot-process 
smoke-flavored fish, cold-process smoked and cold-process smoke- 
flavored fish, because of the hazards of botulism and listeria; 
(2) cooked, ready-to-eat products, because of the 
microbiological hazards associated with products that are not 
intended to be cooked by the consumer; (3) low acid canned 
foods, because of the hazard of botulism and general complexity 
of the processing operation; (4) raw, ready-to-eat products, 
because of the risk of parasites; and (5) species that require a 
judgment as to appropriate location of harvest to avoid unsafe 
pesticide or industrial contaminant levels.

FDA also invites comment on the effect of using a modified 
approach on the regulation of imports, especially with regard to 
the types of products described in item (5) above. 



B. Exempting Small Firms 



FDA invites comment on whether small firms should be exempt 
from the proposed regulation. Even if exempted, these firms 
would still be subject to the requirements of current food safety 
law and to inspection by FDA and State authorities. 

As stated earlier in this preamble, small operations are the 
norm in the seafood industry. A significant majority of 
processors have total revenues of under 1 million dollars. If 
small firms are to be exempted, FDA invites comment on the 
criteria that should be used for exempting them, including how a 
small firm should be defined for purposes of an exemption. 

The implementation of HACCP may be more burdensome for small 
firms than for large firms. Large firms tend to have quality 
control personnel already in place. In addition, many regulatory 
requirements are less burdensome for a large firm in proportion 
to output than they are for a small firm. On the other hand, FDA 
is taking steps, such as the preparation of its HACCP guidance, 
to minimize the cost of these regulations for small businesses. 
Thus, such an exemption may not be needed. 

The agency also points out that, because many large firms 
already have quality control systems, an exemption for small 
business would appear to result in requiring HACCP for that 
segment of the industry (i.e., large firms) that needs it the 
least. Large processors, moreover, tend to process relatively 
low risk products, such as breaded fish and shrimp and raw fish 
blocks. Many high-risk processors, such as processors of 
cooked, ready-to-eat products, tend to be small, and processors 
of raw molluscan shellfish tend to be very small. 

Nonetheless, an exemption for small business could be 
limited to those small businesses that produce low risk products, 
and FDA invites comment on this approach. As stated earlier, 
however, the criteria for determining low as well as high risk 
are not clear, due largely to the limitations of the U.S. 
foodborne illness reporting system. Moreover, a case can be made 
that risk also relates to the margin for error in a processing 
operation and to the consequences of failure as well as to the 
actual occurrence of illness. 

With these points in mind, FDA invites comment on how to 
define ``low risk.'' FDA also invites comment on what the nature 
of the exemption should be. Should a firm be exempt from all or 
part of the HACCP requirements? As circumstances change, a 
HACCP-based analysis of risk by a firm might reveal that the firm 
has become a high risk processor rather than a low risk 
processor. In addition, FDA invites comment on whether such an 
exemption should be obtained by petitioning the agency. 

Finally, even if an exemption were to be adopted in the 
final rule based on the comments received, the agency would still 
encourage voluntary adoption of HACCP systems by exempted firms. 
The advantages that HACCP is expected to provide in terms of 
consumer confidence, control of process, and access to 
international markets warrant adoption of this system.

FDA also invites comment on the effect of a small business 
exemption on the regulation of imports. How would HACCP be 
applied to imports under a tiered approach? Would it be possible 
to treat domestic and imported products equally under such an 
approach? 


C. Staggered Phase-in 



The proposed regulations include an effective date of 1 year 
from the publication of a final rule. FDA has explained the 
reasoning behind this proposed effective date and has invited 
comment on it elsewhere in this preamble. In addition, comments 
are invited on the merits of a staggered phase-in instead of a 
single implementation date for all affected entities. 

The two most obvious ways of accomplishing a staggered 
phase-in would be to differentiate on the basis of size or on the 
basis of risk. Differentiating on the basis of size would 
presumably allow small businesses to have a longer time or times 
for implementation than would be allowed for larger firms. As 
suggested earlier, large firms are probably much more able to 
implement a HACCP system than are small firms. Theoretically, 
the longer lead time for small firms would allow the private 
sector to develop an infrastructure that could help small firms 
implement HACCP. Such an infrastructure could include process 
authorities (see the preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat 
products), testing facilities, and consulting services from trade 
associations, academia, and others. 

As an additional consideration, FDA will likely learn 
lessons from its experiences in implementing the regulation that 
it could apply to the benefit of those that would have to 
implement it at a later date. For example, FDA is considering 
whether it should make the first review of HACCP plans by agency 
investigators a nonregulatory evaluation to facilitate plan 
development by the processor (although the overall inspection of 
the plant would be regulatory). The agency invites comment on 
this approach. Presumably, the more experience the agency has, 
the better this evaluation will be. 

On the other hand, as noted above, small firms are involved 
in the processing of higher risk products. How does this fact 
bear on the possibility of longer implementation times for small 
firms? 

Differentiation solely on the basis of risk appears to be 
more complex than differentiation on the basis of size. If high 
risk products were to be phased in first, it would appear that 
those with the most complex plans to develop and implement would 
receive the shortest lead time, while those with the simplest 
plans would receive the longest lead time. 

Also, the criteria for determining risk would have to be 
carefully considered. FDA asks for comment on whether a 
staggered start should begin with raw molluscan shellfish and 
certain species of finfish that can accumulate scombrotoxin and 
ciguatoxin, or whether other criteria should apply, as discussed 
previously. 

FDA invites comment on all these matters. FDA also invites 
comment on the effect of a phase-in approach on the regulation of 
imports. How could this approach be applied to imported 
products? 



D. Deleting or Modifying Aspects of This Proposal, or Taking 
Some Other Step, to Reduce the Burden of Implementation 




As has already been explained in this preamble, FDA has 
proposed only the basics of HACCP in order to keep the regulatory 
burden to a minimum. Several features of HACCP included within 
the NACMCF's seven principles, such as flow charts and the 
establishment of ``HACCP teams,'' are noted in this preamble, but 
FDA has not proposed to require them. Nonetheless, FDA 
acknowledges that, theoretically, there are a number of ways in 
which this proposal could be scaled back even further. FDA 
invites comments on whether such scaling back would be desirable, 
and, if so, how it could be done. Possible areas for scale-back 
include, but are not limited to: 

(1) Requiring only negative, rather than positive records. 
Negative records note only deviations from critical limits and 
how they are corrected. If a critical control point is under 
control, no record is made. Admittedly, FDA has reservations 
about such an approach. For example, it is virtually impossible 
for firms or for FDA to spot trends that could lead to problems 
if only negative records are being kept. Nonetheless, FDA 
invites comment on this approach.

<TEXT>
 

(2) Developing generic plans by FDA that list critical 
control points and contain other information for various industry 
segments. 
(3) Deleting some or all of the proposed specific 
sanitation requirements. 
(4) Requiring HACCP only for the domestic industry. The 
HACCP requirements would become the basis for negotiating 
agreements with other countries relating to the equivalency of 
regulatory programs. 
(5) Deleting or modifying the proposed training 
requirements. 
(6) Requiring HACCP for processing hazards only. The 
Canadian HACCP system does not involve species-related safety 
hazards. 
(7) Exempting warehouses. 
(8) Although only in guidelines (Appendix B, Scombroid 
Toxin-Forming Species), sanctioning the receipt by a processor 
from a harvester of an assurance of good handling practices, 
rather than detailed time/temperature records. Such an 
assurance, without further verification, would be acceptable only 
from harvesters with histories of delivering acceptable products. 
These four alternative approaches to implementing these 
regulations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Comments are 
invited on them in combination as well as on them individually. 


E. Information and Consumer Awareness 


In addition to requesting comment on alternative approaches 
to HACCP, FDA is taking the opportunity to invite comment on the 
general subject of complementary risk reduction activities, 
primarily directed toward postprocessing handling. Elsewhere in 
this document, FDA invited comment on the advisability of 
applying HACCP or alternative regulatory approaches to commercial 
entities that are not directly subject to these proposed 
regulations, i.e., harvesting vessels, common carriers, and 
retail establishments (although not necessarily doing so as part 
of this rulemaking). In addition, FDA seeks comment on 
appropriate education and information that should be directed 
toward consumers and recreational fishermen. The commercial 
application of HACCP principles can mitigate somewhat the effects 
of poor consumer handling practices by helping to ensure that a 
safe product reaches the home, but no such program can prevent 
illnesses caused by improper home handling. Similarly, HACCP 
practiced by processors can have no effect on recreational 
fishermen who consume their own catch. 

Education has always been an important part of FDA's 
comprehensive seafood safety program, but the agency believes 
that more can be done. Recent FDA education projects include the 
initiation of a seafood hotline, which has been consulted by over 
26,000 individuals on a wide range of seafood safety issues since 
it began in October 1992. (The hotline can be reached by calling 
toll-free, 1-800-FDA-4010.) FDA also recently developed 
brochures aimed at advising certain medically compromised 
populations that they should not eat molluscan shellfish without 
adequate cooking. FDA invites comment on other types of 
education and information activities that might be useful, 
including more information that might be made available through 
grocery stores, pharmacies, and other establishments, through the 
media, and through other means, including labeling. FDA is 
considering the merits of labeling information for consumers of 
molluscan shellfish, and will address this issue in proceedings 
separate from these regulations. FDA notes that several states 
have already mandated, or are in the process of mandating, point- 
of-purchase information for raw molluscan shellfish. 

The agency also invites comment on whether FDA should 
consider proposing to require handling instructions for consumers 
on the labeling of seafood. The Department of Agriculture has 
proposed such requirements for meat and poultry (58 FR 58922, 
November 4, 1993). 

FDA has a longstanding program to control the levels of 
microorganisms of public health concern in seafood. This program 
includes compliance policies on such levels, including zero 
levels (i.e., none detectable based upon official methods) for 
such pathogens as 

Listeria monocytogenes 

in cooked, ready-to-eat 
products and 

Salmonella 

in all foods. These proposed regulations 
require control of microbial pathogens through HACCP principles, 
including specific sanitation controls. Even so, FDA recognizes 
that no system can reduce all risks to zero. Because all foods 
in the home, including seafood, are subject to mishandling and 
cross contamination from other sources, FDA invites comment on 
the general subject of handling instructions. Should FDA decide 
to propose handling instructions, it would do so as a regulatory 
proposal separate from the proposed HACCP requirements for 
seafood. 


IX. Paperwork Reduction Act


This proposed rule contains requirements for information 
collections which are subject to review by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980. The title, description, and respondent description of the 
information collection are shown below with an estimate of the 
annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the 
estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching 
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, 
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 


Title: 

Procedures for the Safe Processing and Importing of 
Fish and Fishery Products.

Description:

 The information requirements in this proposed 
rule are essentially monitoring and recordkeeping requirements 
encompassing critical control points in the production and 
inspection of fish and fishery products as established in the 
HACCP plans of processors and importers. The specific 
information collected and the frequency of collection will depend 
on such factors as the species and the processing conditions. It 
will include observations of processing parameters such as the 
time and temperature of processing and storage; the condition of 
raw materials; the results of chemical and microbiological tests; 
the sanitation conditions in a processing facility; the 
corrective actions taken in response to processing deviations, 
etc. Records identifying production lot codes and date of 
manufacture will also be maintained. Records will be maintained 
by the processing facility or at an importer's place of business 
for 1 year after the date of preparation in the case of 
refrigerated products and at least 2 years for frozen products. 

This information will be used by FDA investigators during 
regularly scheduled inspections of processing plants, or at the 
time of entry of imports, to determine whether products were 
processed under sanitary conditions and processed, packaged, 
stored, and distributed using HACCP control techniques to avoid 
hazards that might cause the products to be adulterated. The 
information will also be used when necessary to trace and remove 
potentially hazardous products from the marketplace. 

Records of processing conditions will also provide a means 
for processors to monitor the quality of their products and to 
alert them when a deviation from the critical limits established 
in the HACCP plan has occurred that may create a potential public 
health hazard in the final product. 

The figures provided below reflect an FDA estimate of the 
annual hours of monitoring and recordkeeping based upon currently 
available data and assumptions about the effects of the 
requirements in proposed part 123. The estimate is based on data 
used to develop cost estimates for the economic impact analysis 
required by Executive Order 12866 and thus is subject to the same 
types of uncertainties described elsewhere in this preamble. For 
example, the agency has anecdotal evidence that the burden on 
firms that are operating under a mandatory HACCP system 
established by the State of Alaska is more nominal. 
Consequently, FDA acknowledges the possibility that the estimates 
provided here are conservatively high, indicating recordkeeping 
burdens that are higher than would customarily be the case. FDA 
specifically invites comments on this point.

Description of Respondents:

 Businesses. 







The agency has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to OMB 
for its review of this information collection. Interested 
persons are requested to send comments regarding this burden 
estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, 
including suggestions for reducing this burden to FDA's Dockets 
Management Branch (address above), and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB rm. 3208, New Executive

Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for FDA. 



X. Economic Impact 



FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under 
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 
96-354). Executive Order 12866 compels agencies to use 
cost-benefit analysis as a component of decisionmaking. The 
Regulatory Flexibility Act requires regulatory relief for small 
businesses where feasible. FDA finds that this proposed rule 
constitutes a major rule under both Executive Order 12866 and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. A summary of the preliminary 
regulatory impact analysis (PRIA), which may be obtained from 
Dockets Management Branch (address above), is presented below. 

Executive Order 12866 requires Federal agencies to justify 
the need for regulations by demonstrating that the problem that 
the regulation is designed to remedy cannot be adequately 
addressed by measures other than Federal regulation. In its 
review of such alternatives, FDA finds that the current system 
(periodic inspection plus sampling of a small proportion of 
seafood), coupled with the uncertainty in estimating the 
illnesses related to seafood, has not adequately ensured 
consumers that a minimum level of safety has been established. 
Although the tort system is not able to provide remedies for 
unsafe seafood, the price system provides some differentiation 
between products based on brands and retail reputation. However, 
the price system works in conjunction with current Federal regulation which signals consumers as to a minimum level
of seafood safety. As is argued in the preamble, countless public arguments and attempts at legislation imply that
the minimum levels that some consumers believe they are getting (those that 
do not search for higher levels) is probably higher than the 
actual levels of seafood safety. 

The tort system fails because consumers are often unable to 
trace either the source of their foodborne illness to seafood, 
and even where that is possible, it is often difficult to trace 
seafood to a specific company. 



A. Regulatory Options 



FDA has evaluated multiple options to address the compelling 
public interest in further ensuring seafood safety. These 
options include: (1) Maintaining the existing approach_``snapshot'' inspections and sampling; (2) significantly

increasing the frequency of both snapshot inspections and 
sampling under the existing approach; (3) beginning a voluntary 
HACCP program in addition to the existing approach; (4) 
beginning mandatory HACCP for high risk products only, in 
addition to the existing approach; (5) beginning mandatory HACCP 
for all seafood (the proposed approach); (6) beginning a more 
comprehensive mandatory HACCP program than that proposed, similar 
to the Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP), which would 
include all CGMP's, quality factors, and economic fraud as 
critical control points; and (7) beginning a mandatory water-to-table HACCP program which would include all vessels,
carriers, 
and retail food operators.

The existing approach does not adequately address the compelling public interest in further ensuring seafood safety
because sampling the large volume of seafood with FDA's limited resources cannot detect many violative products.
Increasing the frequency of sampling and inspections is also unlikely to resolve this problem without significant
increases in funding. These options are discussed extensively in the preamble to the proposed regulations and in
the PRIA. The third option, voluntary HACCP, has been in existence at NOAA and has very few participants. The forth
option, risk-based HACCP, has been evaluated in the PRIA in several forms, including HACCP only for the highest risk
products from a historical perspective and HACCP only for those products with the potential for catastrophic risk.
For example, one possibility evaluated under this option would be to implement HACCP solely for molluscan shellfish,
which NAS and other groups have concluded constitute most of the risk from seafood. The sixth option is more costly
than the proposed option and includes more reliance on CGMP's. Finally, the last option involves mandatory HACCP
for nearly 1 million establishments.

The options evaluated in the PRIA have both lower and higher costs than the proposed option. However, the benefits
of all options are not equal to the proposed option. FDA has quantified net benefits of some of the high risk options
and has found them to have been positive net benefits for those costs and benefits which have been quantified.

These options are not all equal in terms of costs and benefits. They differ significantly from one another in this regard,
as well as from the option that FDA has selected to propose as new part 123. They are also not equal in their ability to
meet all the regulatory objectives stated in the preamble, including effective treatment of imports and an appropriate
alignment of industry and government responsibilities. FDA seeks comment on the costs and benefits as well as on the
general pros and cons of all the stated options and on any options that the agency may have overlooked. It is extremely
important that FDA's evaluation of regulatory options be as thorough as possible for purposes of developing a final
rule, and that the agency be able to fully articulate the distinctions among them and the significance of those distinctions.



B. Costs



There is no single source of data that FDA has found to be entirely satisfactory for developing a preliminary estimate
of the costs of the proposed regulations. Consequently, FDA has considered two sources of information, each with
its own strengths and weaknesses. The results provide a range of possibilities, and FDA invites comment on them.

The first source is U.S. seafood processors that have actually implemented HACCP systems. The number of such firms
may exceed 100. Understandably, many firms are reluctant to make public detailed information about the costs of operation;
consequently, the information available to FDA from this source is incomplete. On the other hand, there is enough
information from which some preliminary conclusions can be drawn that are relevant to an economic assessment.

The second source is a study of the costs of implementing a form of HACCP that was developed by the Department of Commerce
for the congressionally mandated MSSP. That study was performed by an independent contractor for the National Fisheries
Education and Research Foundation, Inc., and commissioned under a grant from NMFS. While these data are the most detailed
available, fitting them to the proposed regulations required extensive adjustments and extrapolations. Thus,
these data also fail to eliminate the considerable uncertainty of the results as they relate to these proposed regulations.



1. Costs: Actual Industry Experience



FDA has some information relevant to the actual costs of implementing HACCP experienced by a number of seafood firms.
While this information is neither detailed nor complete enough to definitively answer the question of how much the
proposed regulations will cost the industry, it does provide insight into the costs of the proposed regulations.

This information includes responses to a 1991 evaluation questionnaire from four of the eight firms that participated
in the FDA/NOAA seafood HACCP pilot in 1990-1991 (Ref. 40). It also includes information more recently provided
to FDA from seven firms through the assistance of NFPA, and from two trade associations. The trade associations, the
NFI and the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) provided FDA with summary information about member
firms that were implementing HACCP systems. NEFDA has operated a HACCP pilot with member firms through a Federal grant.
The two trade associations provided information on 16 firms. The seven firms that provided information about themselves
through NFPA operate a total of 44 processing plants, so FDA has information on at least 64 plants (Ref. 129).

The firms represent a good cross section of processing operation types, including canned, fresh, frozen, smoked/salted,
and cooked, ready-to-eat products as well as molluscan shellfish. The majority of firms were involved in HACCP as
participants in either pilot programs, the NOAA fee-for-service program, or the State of Alaska program, and therefore
have been subject to some form of third party verification of their HACCP systems. Virtually all of them developed
HACCP plans, and the majority of these included critical control points for quality or economic fraud or both in addition
to safety. In this respect, the majority of firms implemented a more extensive form of HACCP than is being proposed
by FDA.

Presumably, start-up costs for HACCP are normally higher than operating costs in subsequent years. The majority
of firms that could estimate their own start-up costs indicated costs in the $1,000 to $5,000 range. The remaining
minority appear to be roughly equally divided between lower and higher costs. A few firms indicated costs in the $20,000
or higher range. These may be firms that decided to hire additional personnel in order to install or implement HACCP.

It should be noted that the cost figures that come from firms that operate more than one plant are for the total costs
of their plants collectively; in order to calculate the average start-up cost per plant for these firms, their costs
would have to be divided by the number of plants.

Nearly twice as many firms did not hire additional personnel or did not anticipate hiring additional personnel as
a result of operating HACCP systems as those who did or felt the need to do so. The overwhelming majority of firms reported
that they believed that the advantages they derived from HACCP were worth the costs to them in terms of better control
over their operations, better sanitation, and greater efficiencies, such as reduced waste. Virtually all foresaw
long-term benefits from operating under HACCP.

FDA notes that there are several uncertainties with this data. The first is that FDA does not know the extent of previous
HACCP-type activities in these firms so that they may have different incremental costs than the industry average.
In addition, these firms may have been relatively larger firms so that they may not be fully representative of the industry.
Also, FDA does not know whether or not these firms would necessarily be in full compliance with the proposed regulations
so that additional costs might have to be expended.



2. Costs: MSSP Study



The MSSP study provides FDA with survey data from which detailed cost estimates have been made in the PRIA, subject
to numerous uncertainties. As this is the largest and only randomly selected data base available to FDA, the PRIA relied
primarily on estimates based on these data. The contractor in the MSSP study sent teams into 130 processing plants,
none of which were operating under HACCP systems, to project the costs to each plant to implement and operate a form
of HACCP chosen for that study.

In areas where FDA had better data than that used in the contractor reports, the agency has used information available
from its field surveys on current practices or conditions in the industry in general, and it has substituted that information
for the information gathered from the sample plants in the contractor reports. Where gaps in the contractor estimates
exist that could not be filled in by information from FDA field surveys, a number of assumptions have been made for the
purposes of this economic assessment. FDA views the cost estimates extrapolated from the contractor reports and
other sources as preliminary and requests comments on them.

From FDA's 1992 official establishment inventory, FDA has estimated that there are 4,846 domestic seafood manufacturing
plants that will be affected by the proposed rule. Thirty-three percent of the first year costs can be attributed to
expenditures necessary to comply with the HACCP-based sanitation provisions of the proposed rule. Another 36 percent
are attributable to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. In addition, approximately 31 percent of the first
year costs are for equipment such as temperature indicators, temperature recorders, and can seam tear-down machines.
Additional costs are for HACCP training, consulting by processing authorities, writing HACCP plans, instituting
operational changes, responding to critical limit deviations, and analytical testing. The average expected cost
of the proposed rule per domestic manufacturing plant is estimated to be $23,900 in the first year ($24,000 for small
plants, $23,400 for large plants) and $15,000 in the following years ($14,700 for small plants and $15,700 for large
plants). Total costs of the proposed rule for domestic manufacturers are estimated to be $117 million in the first
year and $65 million in the following years.

In addition, FDA estimates that 924 importers will bear start-up costs of approximately $8 million, and 1,571 repackers
and warehouses will bear annual recurring costs of $14 million. Therefore, based on these data, FDA estimates domestic
costs for this rule to be $139 million in the first year and $79 million in succeeding years. Discounted domestic costs
are estimated to be $676 million over 10 years (6 percent). FDA also estimates that 8,125 foreign processors will have
initial costs of $96 million and recurring costs of $44 million.

Should smoked fish products be required to bear refrigeration statements on their labels, the maximum possible cost
to this industry segment would be estimated to be $2.5 million for a label redesign for all products. A label redesign
would be likely only in the case of extensive refrigeration instructions. If a simple statement such as ``keep refrigerated''
were to be required, then the cost to the smoked fish industry would be approximately $168,000 because approximately
75 percent of the products currently bear such statements.
These estimates are considerably higher than the estimates from data submitted to FDA from seafood plants as discussed
above. These differences may be attributable to several factors. For example, the MSSP-based estimates also include
estimated costs of compliance by processors with pre-existing sanitation requirements in part 110 and costs of complying
with guidelines that are appended to these proposed regulations. Although these costs are not inherent to the operation
of a HACCP system, they represent one-third of the total MSSP-based estimates. As indicated earlier in this document,
compliance with CGMP's for sanitation has been a continuing problem across the industry. For this reason, FDA is proposing
specific sanitation requirements in subpart A of part 123.
Moreover, the estimate of costs associated with complying with guidelines in the appendices may be overstated because,
in actuality, FDA may find industry practices other than those stated in the guidelines to be acceptable. The guidelines
are intended to provide the industry with information on how it could implement HACCP, not how it must do so.
Costs to importers and to foreign processors that ship to the United States were also estimated. In the absence of reliable
data for estimating costs to foreign processors, FDA estimated the number of plants that export seafood to the United
States and based their costs of implementing HACCP on MSSP- generated data on the costs to U.S. plants.
It is important to recognize that many of the United States major seafood trading partners are using, or have opted
for, HACCP programs. For example, the EC will soon require HACCP or an equivalent system from over 100 nations that
export to it. Consequently, with the current trend toward HACCP worldwide, the costs to many foreign processors of
implementing HACCP may be incurred regardless of whether FDA issued these proposed regulations. Moreover, in the
near future, U.S. importers subject to this proposed rule should have little difficulty finding products produced
under HACCP. FDA specifically invites comment on the estimated costs of the proposed regulations to importers and
foreign processors, e.g., whether they are high due to the worldwide move toward HACCP or whether they are low due to
other factors that have not been considered, and the potential effect on U.S. consumers of requiring that imports
be produced under HACCP systems.
The PRIA presumes that most of the cost of compliance of the proposed regulations will be passed on to consumers. Estimating
the magnitude of these price increases is difficult. U.S. consumers spent about $16.5 billion on domestically produced
seafood in 1991 (Ref. 42). If the domestic industry passed on all of the estimated annual costs to consumers, prices
for domestically produced seafood would increase by less than 1 percent in the first year and less than one-half of
1 percent in succeeding years. Price changes of such magnitude are unlikely to have a major impact on general seafood
purchases. However, some regional price increases may considerably exceed this. In addition, this estimation of
change in price does not address potential concentration effects. It is worth noting that the contractor that performed
the MSSP study estimated a range of cost increases from negligible to 1.3 percent, depending on the type of product.
The effect on prices of imported products is impossible to estimate. While the PRIA uses MSSP data and a number of assumptions
to estimate possible costs to foreign processors of complying with the proposed regulations, those costs will be
spread among the consumers from all nations to which these processors export. FDA is unable to estimate what percentage
of these costs would be passed on to U.S. consumers.
On the other side of the ledger, the MSSP-based estimates were not able to include costs associated with some features
of the proposed rules because data were lacking. An inventory of these features is provided in the PRIA, and FDA invites
comment on possible costs associated with them. They include prevention of cross contamination by the separation
of food contact surfaces, storage at 40 
 F of cooked, ready-to-eat products and products that are made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species,
and the costs of following the approach presented in the guidelines at Appendix B for scombroid toxin forming species.

C. Benefits


This proposed action will reduce the amount of illness that derives from consumption of seafood (safety benefits)
and may have significant nutrition benefits that result from increased consumption of seafood. The increased consumption
will result from a decrease in consumer anxiety associated with the consumption of seafood. In addition, there may
be significant cost savings (benefits) in other areas as a result of adoption of this proposed rule.
The existence of a national, mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system for seafood should have a beneficial, although
nonquantifiable effect on both the industry and the Federal government. FDA knows from experience that continuing
concerns about the adequacy of the current Federal regulatory system for seafood place a financial stress on industry,
which must constantly defend itself from criticism, and on regulatory agencies such as FDA, which must divert resources
in order to respond to the Congress and the media. While public interest in food safety is healthy and desirable, the
extreme interest in seafood safety, which has manifested itself in over 10 congressional hearings and over 20 pieces
of legislation in the past 5 years, demonstrates how a system that is less than fully adequate from the public's standpoint
can cause a steady diversion of both public and private resources that is likely to continue in the absence of a system
that overcomes current inefficiencies and shortcomings.
Finally, there will be an additional benefit to firms wishing to export seafood to those countries which require federally
monitored HACCP. The latter two benefits have not been quantified, and FDA requests comments on how this might be done.
The agency followed three steps to quantify the safety benefits of HACCP for processors: (1) Identify all significant
hazards associated with seafood safety and establish the baseline number of incidents of each hazard in the U.S. population;
(2) estimate the reduction in the number of incidents of each hazard that HACCP is expected to accomplish; and (3) quantify
the benefit of the reduced illnesses and deaths. In all three steps, FDA acknowledges that there is substantial uncertainty.
First, to establish a baseline number of illnesses, FDA reviewed both reported data to the CDCP, which provides a lower
bound on the actual number of cases, and an earlier FDA risk assessment that estimated an upper-bound number of cases.
Using information about the probable amount of underreporting for each type of illness, FDA constructed a likely
baseline number for each type of illness by inflating these numbers between zero and 1,000 times the amount reported.
Thus, for example, while it is likely that nearly all cases of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) are reported to
CDCP, it is likely that 

Campylobacter jejuni

 is underreported by approximately 100 times the actual number of cases. This approach for estimating cases yielded
an estimated 33,000 cases of illness from seafood per year. However, FDA acknowledges that even a reasonably precise
estimate of the number of illnesses cannot be determined with the existing foodborne disease reporting mechanisms
in this country.
In the second step, FDA used a panel of internal experts to determine the number of illnesses the proposed regulations
are likely to reduce.
 For example, it is not likely to reduce any cases of NSP because they are primarily associated with recreational fishing.
On the other hand, it is likely to reduce over 50 percent of scombroid poisoning because most of the mishandling of seafood
comes either at the catch or processing stages. This action will not reduce any cases that are a result of consumer or
retailer mishandling but, as explained earlier in this document, problems at the retail level are addressed through
mechanisms outside of this proposed regulation. FDA has estimated that between 5,000 and 19,000 cases of seafood
illness and death will be reduced by the proposed action annually.




In the third step, FDA used economic valuation techniques to quantify the effect of reducing the range of cases of seafood
illness. This technique combines costs of illness, such as hospital costs, with the costs of pain and suffering in
a reduced health state to estimate the cost of each hazard. Thus, for example, NSP, with very mild symptoms, has a low
cost per case ($270), whereas 

Vibrio vulnificus,

 with a high probability of death, has a very high cost ($1.3 million per case). Using this methodology, the total safety
benefits of the proposed option are valued between $15 and $75 million per year.

FDA has also evaluated the potential health benefits 
associated with increased consumption of seafood. Because of the 
negative publicity concerning water pollution and seafood safety, 
consumer perception of seafood safety may overestimate actual 
risk. In addition, contamination scares cause drastic short-term 
drops in consumer demand for seafood products and undoubtedly 
contribute to the chronic level of consumer concern about seafood 
safety. Thus, safety concerns about seafood are a likely factor 
preventing wider consumer acceptance of seafood as part of the 
U.S. diet. 



If this proposal is finalized, consumer concerns about 
seafood safety may be reduced which may, in turn, lead to 
increased consumption of seafood. FDA has evaluated the 
possibility that consumers may switch from higher fat flesh 
protein, such as meat and poultry, to seafood. The resulting 
reduced dietary fat in the diet of the general population would 
result in reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and cancer. 
Using the same methodology employed in an earlier analysis of the 
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-535), 
FDA analyzed the benefits of a 1- and 5-pound per capita increase 
in consumption of seafood. These were estimated to decrease 
deaths by 673 and 2,782, respectively, over a 10-year period. 
The resulting benefits are valued at $3 and $14 billion. 




D. Small Business Impact 





The proposed rule will have a substantial impact on small 
seafood processors as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
Eighty percent of the seafood processors covered by this proposed 
regulation are small, where small is defined for nonshrimp firms 
as less than $1 million in annual gross revenue and less than $2 
million for shrimp firms. The provisions of this rule, such as 
monitoring and recordkeeping, are largely fixed costs (costs 
which do not vary significantly with the amount of the product 
produced) which will impose larger per unit costs on small rather 
than on large businesses. In addition, small firms may have as 
many critical control points as large firms because critical 
control points tend to be related to the complexity of the 
operation, not the size of the business. However, it may be that 
smaller firms are less complex than large firms, although the 
agency does not have sufficient data to determine if this is so. 



In some cases the increase in cost will be large enough to 
cause some firms to go out of business. For example, estimates 
of firm failure have been as low as 2 percent (96 firms) of all 
firms (from the Canadian experience) to 334 firms (estimated for 
compliance with MSSP). However, FDA does not have enough 
information to estimate the number of firms that will close if 
the proposed rule becomes final. 



There are several factors that affect the ability of small 
processors to comply with the proposed regulations. First, the 
basic HACCP requirements proposed in subpart A of part 123 
deliberately include only the essentials of HACCP in order to 
keep fixed costs to a minimum. Second, FDA is developing 
considerable guidance in the form of a hazard guide and model 
HACCP plans to enable small processors to implement an effective 
HACCP system at the lowest possible cost. Third, FDA is also 
aware that academia and trade associations are available to 
assist processors to implement HACCP. Finally, for those small 
processors that have very simple operations requiring few 
critical control points, an inherent feature of HACCP is that it 
adjusts to the complexity and risks of an operation. 



While any closure is regrettable, the agency strongly 
believes that firms that are unable to identify the likely 
hazards associated with their products and take reasonable 
preventive controls to prevent those hazards from occurring 
should not be selling food in interstate commerce. As described 
in the preamble, FDA is keenly interested in keeping the costs of 
implementing HACCP to a minimum and is issuing guidance documents 
and model HACCP plans to facilitate such implementation. 



FDA is specifically requesting comment in areas where costs 
and benefit estimates are either very uncertain or potentially 
large. FDA will utilize answers received on these comments along 
with all other comments to help formulate the final rule.

1. Costs 





FDA specifically requests comments on: 



(1) The expected cost to retrofit plants as necessary for 
the proper operation of HACCP controls (e.g., enhance 
refrigerator capacity, water supply changes, etc.). 



(2) The cost of taking corrective actions to respond to 
critical limit deviations on an annual basis. FDA has estimated 
an average of $1,000 per firm to take such actions as discarding 
product, buying new equipment, and changing the processing 
practice. 



(3) The cost of training employees. FDA has estimated that 
there will be a cost per plant of $900 to train an employee to 
manage HACCP. This will include the cost of training, travel 
expenses, and loss of several days of productivity for that 
employee. Not all of these costs may be borne by manufacturers, 
however, because some training may be sponsored by academia, 
trade associations, and others. 



(4) The cost of ensuring that cooking and pasteurizing 
equipment and processes are achieving the desired safety results 
(i.e., destroying microbiological pathogens). This ensurance may 
be obtained by having equipment and processes that are equivalent 
to those found effective by a processing authority. FDA 
estimated that this would cost $1,000 per plant in the first year 
and, on average, half that amount in the following years as 
processors change their processes and equipment. This cost may be offset, however, by reliance on literature that
contains the 
necessary information from a processing authority. 



(5) The cost of temperature indicators and thermometers for 
plants who do not now have this equipment. FDA estimated that 
the cost would be $1,000 per plant, initially, with replacement 
as necessary. 



(6) The cost of creating a HACCP plan from the guidance 
provided by FDA. FDA estimated that it will take processors with 
simpler processes 24 hours of managerial time to adapt the 
guidance into a HACCP plan. FDA estimated that it will take 
processors with more complex processes 72 hours of managerial 
time to adapt the guidance into a HACCP plan. 



(7) FDA requests comment on the recordkeeping burden 
associated with the proposed sanitation requirements in  123.10 
(b) and (c). If possible, such estimates should be provided in 
terms of hours spent and translated into dollars if staff 
compensation rates are known. 



In addition, FDA was unable to provide cost estimates of the 
following provisions and requests specific comments on these 
areas: 



(1) Section 123.10(a)(7), prevention of cross-contamination 
by the separation of food-contact surfaces; 



(2) Section 123.10(a)(14), storage at 40 
 F or below; 



(3) Appendix A.6., cooling after cooking; 



(4) Appendix B., scombroid toxin forming species; 



(5) Appendix 1., specifically, the guidance on smoked and 
smoke-flavored fishery products; 



(6) Increased short-term recall potential, if any, due to 
heightened industry awareness; 



(7) Increasing time spent escorting Federal inspectors, 
particularly in the initial phases; 



(8) The cost of restricting catch in certain areas and 
seasons if processors find it necessary. 




2. Benefits 





(1) FDA is reprinting two tables from the PRIA and requests 
comments on both the baseline number of illnesses due to seafood 
and the likelihood that HACCP for processors will reduce those 
illnesses. The baseline number of illnesses reflects an estimate 
of all cases (from any source, including recreational harvest, 
retail, and consumer mishandling). FDA considers the estimates 
in both tables as preliminary estimates.

(2) FDA also specifically requests comments on the number 
of cases of illness included in the baseline estimate (33,035) 
that may be due to factors outside the processors' control, such 
as those due to recreational harvests (that are not eventually 
sent to processors), those due to restaurants and supermarkets, 
and those due to consumer mishandling. 
(3) As mentioned above, FDA has also estimated potential 
benefits associated with increased seafood consumption. These 
benefits will only be realized if the price increase resulting 
from this rule does not offset the effect of increased demand for 
seafood which will result from reduced consumer anxiety. FDA 
requests specific comment on the likelihood that seafood 
consumption will be increased as a result of this rule. 
(4) FDA has identified but not quantified benefits to 
seafood exporters as well as reduced public anxiety associated 
with the safety of seafood. FDA requests comments on these 
benefits (including how to quantify them) as well as other 
potential benefits such as how HACCP will help firms gain better 
control over their operations, better sanitation and greater 
efficiencies such as reduced product waste. 


E. Tribal Governments 


FDA is aware that some tribal governments are involved in 
the processing of seafood for interstate commerce. The agency 
expects that the proposed regulations will apply to them in such 
cases. Executive Order 12875 of October 26, 1993, requires, 
among other things, consultation with tribal governments before 
the formal promulgation of regulations containing unfunded 
Federal mandates. While FDA does not believe that the proposed 
regulations would impose an unfunded Federal mandate, the agency 
wishes to foster consultation on matters that might significantly 
affect tribal communities. Consequently, FDA specifically 
requests comment on the economic effect of the proposed 
regulations on tribal governments. 


F. Availability of PRIA/RFA 


FDA acknowledges considerable uncertainty in both cost and 
benefit estimates of the proposed regulations and requests 
comment on all aspects of the PRIA and the RFA. The full 
PRIA/RIA is available at the Dockets Management Branch (address 
above). 



XI. Environmental Impact 


The agency has carefully considered the potential 
environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the 
action will not have a significant impact on the human 
environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not 
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the 
evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental 
assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address 
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 



XII. Request for Comments 



Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1994, submit 
to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments 
regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be 
submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments 
are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in 
the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in 
the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through 
Friday. 





XIII. References 


The following references have been placed on display in the

 123.5 

Current good manufacturing practice (sanitation). 


(a) The criteria in part 110 of this chapter apply in 
determining whether the facilities, methods, practices, and 
controls used to process fish and fishery products are safe, and 
whether these products have been processed under sanitary 
conditions. 
(b) The purpose of subpart A of this part is to set forth 
requirements specific to the processing of fish and fishery 
products. 


 123.6 

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan. 


(a) Every processor and importer shall have and implement a 
written HACCP plan that is specific to: 
(1) Each location where fish and fishery products are 
processed by that processor; and 
(2) Each kind of fish and fishery product processed by the 
processor. The plan may group kinds of fish and fishery products 
together if the hazards, critical control points, critical 
limits, and procedures required to be identified in paragraph (b) 
of this section are identical for all fish and fishery products 
so grouped. 
(b) The HACCP plan shall: 
(1) Identify the safety hazards that are reasonably likely 
to occur and that thus must be controlled for each fish and 
fishery product, including, as appropriate: 
(i) Natural toxins; 
(ii) Microbiological contamination; 
(iii) Chemical contamination; 
(iv) Pesticides; 
(v) Drug residues; 
(vi) Decomposition; 
(vii) Parasites; 
(viii) Unapproved direct and indirect food and color 
additives; and 
(ix) Physical hazards; 
(2) Identify the critical control points for each of the 
identified hazards; 
(3) Identify the critical limits that must be met at each 
of the critical control points; 
(4) Identify the procedures, and frequency thereof, 
including the use of consumer complaints received by the 
processor or importer, that will be used to control and monitor 
each of the critical control points to ensure compliance with the 
critical limits. Such procedures shall include the calibration 
of process control instruments and validation of software for 
computer control systems as appropriate; 
(5) Provide for a recordkeeping system that will document 
the monitoring of the critical control points. The records shall 
contain the actual values obtained during monitoring. The 
records shall also include consumer complaints that relate to the 
operation of critical control points or possible critical limit 
deviations. 
(c) In addition, the HACCP plan should: 
(1) Identify other consumer hazards not related to the 
safety of the product, including, but not necessarily limited to: 
(i) Decomposition not associated with human illness; and 
(ii) Economic adulteration. 
(2) Provide for control of these hazards in the manner 
described by paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section. 
(d) Failure of a processor or importer to have and 
implement an HACCP plan that complies with this section or to 
operate in accordance with the requirements of this part, shall 
render the products of that processor or importer adulterated 
under section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act. 


 123.7 

Corrective actions. 


(a) Any critical limit deviation shall require: 
(1) Segregation and holding of the affected product, at 
least until the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of 
this section are met; 
(2) Immediate review by an individual or individuals who 
have been trained in accordance with  123.9, to determine the 
acceptability of the lot in question for distribution, based on a 
judgment as to whether the deviation may have rendered the 
product in that lot injurious to health or otherwise adulterated; 
(3) Corrective action, when necessary, with respect to the 
affected product and the critical control point at which the 
deviation occurred; 
(4) Timely assessment by an individual or individuals who 
have been trained in accordance with  123.9, to determine 
whether the process or Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
(HACCP) plan needs to be modified to reduce the risk of 
recurrence of the deviation; and 
(5) Modification when necessary as it applies to the 
process or HACCP plan. 
(b) When a processor or importer receives a consumer 
complaint that may be related to the performance of a critical 
control point or that may reflect a critical limit deviation, it 
shall determine whether corrective action as described by 
paragraph (a) of this section is appropriate and, if so, it shall 
take such action. 
(c) All actions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section shall be documented in records that are subject to the 
requirements of  123.8.

 123.8 


Records. 


(a) Records required by this part that involve observations 
or measurements during processing or related activities, 
including corrective actions taken in accordance with  123.7, 
shall include the identity of the product, product code, and date 
of activity that the record reflects. Processing and other 
information shall be entered at the time that it is observed. 
Each record shall be signed by the operator or observer, except 
that corrective action records need only be signed in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section. 

(b) Records required by this part shall be reviewed, 
signed, and dated by an individual who has been trained in 
accordance with  123.9, before distribution of the product for 
completeness and compliance with the established critical limits. 

(c) The records required by this part shall be retained at 
the processing facility or the importer's place of business in 
the United States for at least 1 year after the date they were 
prepared in the case of refrigerated products and for at least 2 
years after the date they were prepared in the case of frozen or 
preserved products. Records that relate to the general adequacy 
of equipment or processes being used by a processor, including 
the results of scientific studies and evaluations, shall be 
retained at the processing facility for at least 2 years after 
their applicability to the product being produced at the 
facility. If the processing facility is closed between seasonal 
packs, the records may be transferred to some other reasonably 
accessible location during the period of closure. 


(d) All records required by this part, including HACCP 
plans required in  123.6 and consumer complaints that may be 
related to a critical limit deviation, shall be available for 
review and copying at reasonable times by duly authorized 
officers and employees. 



(e) Tags as defined in  123.3(t) are not subject to the 
requirements of this section. 




 123.9 



Training. 




Each processor and importer shall employ at least one 
individual who has successfully completed a prescribed course of 
instruction in the application of Hazard Analysis Critical 
Control Point (HACCP) principles to fish and fishery product 
processing at a program of instruction approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration. At a minimum, this individual shall be 
responsible for developing and modifying the plan as required by 
 123.6, evaluating critical limit deviations and corrective 
actions as required by  123.7, and performing record review as 
required by  123.8(b). 




 123.10 



Sanitation control procedures. 



(a) Every processor and importer who takes physical 
possession of fish or fishery products and engages in the 
processing of such fish or fishery products, including storing 
such products, shall perform sanitation inspections and ensure at 
a minimum that, to the extent applicable to the operations 
conducted by the processor or importer, the following conditions 
apply: 

(1) Water that directly comes into contact with a product 
or with food contact surfaces, or is used in the manufacture of 
ice, is derived from a safe and sanitary source or is being

according to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, except that:
(1) The hand sanitizer strength and sanitary practices of the processing employees, especially as these relate to
hand washing and sanitizing practices and the potential for cross contamination, shall be checked and recorded at
least every 4 hours during processing.
(2) All utensils and food-contact surfaces of equipment shall be inspected immediately after each cleaning and sanitizing
operation under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. Each such cleaning and sanitizing shall be documented, and
such documentation shall at a minimum record the time of each cleaning, the concentration of the sanitizer, and the
condition of the equipment.
(3) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(8)(i), (a)(12), and (a)(18) of this section shall
be performed and documented with such frequency as is necessary to ensure control.

with such frequency as is necessary to ensure control.
(d) Where deviations from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are noted during these inspections, appropriate
corrective actions shall be taken and documented on the sanitation control record.
(e) Every plant should have a written standard operating procedure (SOP) for assuring the maintenance of proper sanitary
conditions and practices during processing that is specific to each fish and fishery product produced at that location.
The SOP should include, at a minimum, requirements as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(f)(1) All fish to be smoked or salted shall be eviscerated and free of residual viscera, except for:
(i) Small species of fish, such as anchovies and herring sprats, provided that they are processed in a fashion so that
they contain a water-phase salt level of at least 10 percent, a water activity below 0.85, or a pH of 4.6 or less; and
(ii) Fish that are fully cooked before further processing.
(2) Evisceration shall be conducted in an area that is segregated and separate from other processing operations.
Evisceration shall be performed with minimal disturbance of the intestinal tract contents. The fish, including
the body cavity, shall be washed thoroughly with a vigorous water spray or a continuous water flow system.


 123.11


Obligations of importers.


This section sets forth the specific obligations of importers of fish and fishery products into the United States.
(a) An importer of fish or fishery products shall have and implement a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)
plan in accordance with  123.6 that describes how the fish will be prepared, packed, or held while it is in the
control of the importer.
(b) The importer of fish or fishery products shall have on file the HACCP plans of each of its foreign processors.
(c) The importer shall take affirmative steps to ensure that the fish and fishery products that it offers for import
were produced under the HACCP plan that it has in its possession and subject to the sanitation controls listed in  123.10.
Such steps may include, but would not be limited to:
(1) Obtaining from the foreign processor the HACCP monitoring records that relate to the specific fish or fishery
products being offered for import.
(2) Obtaining a certificate from a foreign government inspection authority certifying that the firm is operating
under a valid HACCP plan or certification on a lot-by-lot basis.

1. General Guidelines for Cooked, Ready-to-Eat Fishery Products 



This Appendix provides guidance on how 
to meet the requirements of 21 CFR part 123, 
subpart A for the processing of cooked, 
ready-to-eat fishery products. Cooked, 
ready-to-eat fishery products are those that 
are subjected by a commercial processor to 
either a cooking process before being placed 
in a final container, or to pasteurization in 
the final container, or to both. This 
guidance involves processing procedures that 
are common to most of these products for the 
control of the microbiological hazards to 
which they are particularly susceptible. The 
guidance does not apply to environmental or 
other hazards that might occur before the 
processor takes possession of the product or 
raw materials. (Guidance on these hazards 
may be found in a separate guidance document 
for all fish and fishery products to be 
issued by FDA.) This guidance also does not 
apply to cooked, ready-to-eat fishery 
products covered by 21 CFR part 123, subpart B. 



2. Definitions in Appendix A

continuous record of the temperature 
conditions being monitored. 



3. Critical Control Points 



Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
(HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with 21 
CFR part 123, subpart A will typically 
identify and address the following critical 
control points: 

a. Cooking; 

b. Pasteurization;

i. Distribution. 

In accordance with 21 CFR part 123, subpart 
A, processors shall identify in their HACCP 
plans how they will control hazards at 
critical control points. The measures in 
sections 4. through 6. of this Appendix are 
suitable for HACCP plans.

4. Thermal Processing Critical Control Points 



a. Cooking 



1. 

The Cooking Process. 

The processor 
must be able to demonstrate to itself and to 
FDA that its cooking process ensures the 
destruction of vegetative cells of 
microorganisms of public health concern. 
This may be accomplished by having a cooking 
process that is at least equivalent to a 
process established by a process authority. 
To demonstrate equivalence, a processor 
should have on file in its Hazard Analysis 
Critical Control Point (HACCP) records a 
document that: 

i. Describes the results of a 
scientific evaluation, conducted by a process 
authority, of the adequacy of the cooking 
process; and 

ii. Identifies and establishes values 
for key aspects of the process or of the 
product that may affect the adequate 
destruction of microorganisms of public 
health concern. At a minimum, these values 
should include cooking times and 
temperatures. 

Such a document may consist of, but 
should not be limited to, a letter from a 
process authority, articles in scientific 
journals, or Federal, State, or local 
government regulations or advisories. 
Failure to have documentation that the 
cooking process will achieve its goal will 
violate 21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the 
product produced by the processor will be 
produced under insanitary conditions whereby 
it may be rendered injurious to health. 

2. 

Cooking Equipment Design. 

i. The processor must be able to 
demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its 
cooking equipment can deliver the cooking 
process that ensures the destruction of 
vegetative cells of microorganisms of public 
health concern. One way to accomplish this 
is for the processor to have on file in its 
HACCP records a document that describes the 
results of a scientific evaluation, conducted 
by a process authority, of the design and 
operation of the type of equipment and the 
operational procedures used by the processor. 
The engineering specifications for the 
equipment used by the processor (e.g., pipe 
sizes, flow rates, loading configuration, 
and, whenever a steam process is used, 
venting parameters) should meet or exceed 
those for the equipment evaluated by the 
process authority. Failure to have 
documentation that the cooking equipment will 
achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 123.8 
and will mean that the product produced by 
the processor will be produced under 
insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
rendered injurious to health. 

ii. Cooking equipment should be 
equipped with both a temperature-indicating 
device and temperature-recording device. The 
temperature-indicating device should be the 
reference instrument for determining 
conformance to the established process 
temperatures. 

3. Records.

Monitoring records made by the processor 
should record both the actual values that are 
occurring for those key aspects of the 
process identified by the process authority 
in section 4.a.1. of this Appendix and the 
actual values that are occurring for 
operational procedures identified by the 
process authority in section 4.a.2.i. of this 
Appendix.

4. Special Considerations. 


 For the cooking of blue crab 
(Callinectes sapidus

), dungeness crab (

Cancer 
magister

), or king crab (

Paralithodes 
camtschatica

), the known lethality of the 
cooking process necessary to make the product 
generally acceptable for human consumption, 
or to enable further processing, is 
sufficient so that the adequacy of the 
process and the equipment can normally be 
assumed. 


 

b. Pasteurization 


 

1. 

The Pasteurization Process.

 The 
processor must be able to demonstrate to 
itself and to FDA that its pasteurization 
process ensures the adequate reduction of 
numbers of viable spores of microorganisms of 
public health concern. One way to accomplish 
this is to have a pasteurization process that 
is equivalent to a process established by a 
process authority. To demonstrate 
equivalence, a processor should have on file 
in its HACCP records a document that: 


 i. Describes the results of a 
scientific evaluation conducted by a process 
authority of the adequacy of the 
pasteurization process; and that 


 ii. Identifies and establishes values 
for those key aspects of the process, or of 
the product, that may affect the adequate 
reduction in numbers of microorganisms of 
public health concern. At a minimum, these 
values should include pasteurization times 
and temperatures. 


 Such document may consist of, but should 
not be limited to, a letter from a process 
authority, articles in scientific journals, 
or Federal, State or local government 
regulations or advisories. Failure to have 
documentation that the pasteurization process 
will achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 
123.8 and will mean that the product produced 
by the processor will be produced under 
insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
rendered injurious to health. 


 2. 

Pasteurization Equipment Design. 


 i. The processor must be able to 
demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its 
pasteurization equipment can deliver the 
pasteurization process that ensures the 
adequate reduction of viable spores of 
microorganisms of public health concern. One 
way to accomplish this is to have on file a 
document that describes the results of a 
scientific evaluation conducted by a process 
authority, of the design and operation of the 
type of equipment used by the processor. The 
engineering specifications for the equipment 
used by the processor (e.g., pipe sizes, flow 
rates, loading configuration) should meet or 
exceed those for the equipment evaluated by 
the process authority. Failure to have 
documentation that the pasteurization 
equipment will achieve its goals will violate 
21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the product 
produced by the processor will be produced 
under insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
rendered injurious to health. 


 ii. Pasteurization equipment should be 
equipped with both a temperature-indicating 
device and temperature-recording device. The 
temperature-indicating device should be the 
reference instrument for determining 
conformance to the established process 
temperatures. 


 3. Records.

 Monitoring records made by the processor should record the actual values 
that are occurring for those key aspect of 
the process identified by the process 
authority in section 4.b.1.ii of this 
Appendix. 


 

5. Container Integrity Critical Controls Points 


 

a. Finished Product Container Sealing 


 

Finished product containers must be 
inspected, and the results recorded, for 
container integrity to assure a consistently 
reliable hermetic seal. FDA recommends that: 


 1. Visual seam inspection of one 
container from each seaming head occur every 
30 minutes; and 


 2. Testing by qualified personnel of 
one container from each seaming head occur at 
least every 4 hours. As applicable, these 
tests should be performed in accordance with 
21 CFR 113.60(a)(1) and (a)(2). 


 

b. Post-pasteurization Cooling 


 

Container cooling water must contain a 
measurable residual of chlorine or other 
sanitizer. Tests to determine the presence 
of a measurable residual of chlorine or other 
sanitizer in the container cooling water 
should be made, and the results recorded, at 
sufficient frequency to ensure control.

6. Time and Temperature Critical Control 
Points 


 

a. Cooling After Cooking 


 

After cooking, the product must be 
rapidly cooled to minimize recontamination. 
Continuous cooling from 140 
 F (60 
 C) to 
achieve an internal temperature of 70 
 F 
(21.1 
 C) or below within 2 hours and an 
internal temperature of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or 
below within an additional 4 hours, unless 
processing after cooking, as described in 
section 6.b. of this Appendix, occurs during 
either of these time periods, will 
effectively minimize recontamination. Other 
time/temperature parameters may also be 
effective. Processors should ensure that the 
cooling parameters are met by either: 


 1. 

Monitoring.

 Monitoring and 
recording internal product temperatures at 
least every 2 hours; or 


 2. 

Studies. 


 i. Conducting or obtaining a study that 
establishes that appropriate cooling 
temperatures are always met under prescribed 
processing conditions. The study should 
establish the limits of significant variables 
that could affect the rate of cooling. These 
variables may include product size, ambient 
air temperature, and amount of product in the 
cooler. An adequate study should consist of 
at least three processing runs under the 
prescribed processing conditions; and 


 ii. Monitoring and recording the 
prescribed processing conditions as 
identified by the study in section 6.a.2.i. 
of this Appendix at least every 2 hours. 


 

b. Processing After Cooking 


 

Products that will receive processing 
after cooking should not be exposed to 
ambient temperatures of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or 
higher for longer than a cumulative total of 
4 hours after cooking. If they are exposed 
to such temperatures for more than 4 hours, 
unacceptable recontamination is the likely 
result. Processors are required to regularly 
monitor and record the length of time that 
the product is exposed to temperatures above 
40 
 F (4.4 
 C) under 21 CFR 123.8. FDA 
recommends that such monitoring and recording 
be done at least every 2 hours. 


 

c. Final Product Cooling 


 

To avoid microbiological hazards for 
perishable finished products, the internal 
temperature of the finished product should be 
40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below within 4 hours of 
either placement in a finished product 
container or the completion of 
pasteurization. Processors should either 
conduct: 


 1. Monitoring.

 Monitor and record 
internal product temperatures at least every 
2 hours; or 


 2. 

Studies. 


 i. Conduct or obtain a study that 
establishes that the internal temperature of 
the finished product will always be 40 
 F 
(4.4 
 C) or below within 4 hours of either 
placement in a finished product container or 
completion of pasteurization under prescribed 
processing conditions. The study should 
establish the limits of significant variables 
that could affect the rate of cooling. These 
variables may include product size, ambient 
air temperature, and amount of product in the 
cooler. An adequate study should consist of 
at least three processing runs under the 
prescribed processing conditions; and 


 ii. Monitoring and recording the 
prescribed processing conditions as 
identified by the study in section 6.c.2.i. 
of this Appendix at least every 2 hours. 


 

d. Refrigerated Storage


 

1. In-process products.

 Refrigeration 
units that are being used to store in-process 
products or finished products shall operate 
at a temperature of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below 
in accordance with 21 CFR 123.10(a)(14). 


 2. 

Temperature devices.

 Units should 
be equipped with both a temperature-indicating device and a temperature-recording 
device. In lieu of a temperature-recording 
device, a processor may equip a refrigeration 
unit with a high temperature alarm or a 
maximum-indicating thermometer and maintain a 
temperature log that notes temperature with 
such frequency as is necessary to achieve 
control. 


 

e. Distribution 


 

All perishable finished products should 
be distributed in a manner that ensures that 
the internal temperature is maintained at 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below. 


 

7. Temperature Monitoring Equipment 


 

Where reference is made in this Appendix 
to temperature-indicating devices and 
temperature-recording devices, the following 
conditions should apply: 


 

a. Temperature-Indicating Devices 


 

Temperature-indicating devices should be 
installed where they can be easily read and 
located to ensure that they accurately 
measure the warmest temperature of the 
refrigeration equipment and the coldest 
temperature of the heating equipment, as 
appropriate. Temperature-indicating devices 
should be calibrated at the routine operating 
temperature of the refrigeration, cooling, or 
heating equipment against a known accurate 
standard thermometer upon installation and at 
least once a year thereafter, or more 
frequently, if necessary, to ensure their 
accuracy. Records required to be maintained 
under 21 CFR 123.8 of accuracy checks for 
temperature-indicating devices should specify 
the date, standard used, method used, 
results, and person performing the test. A 
temperature-indicating device that has a 
divided fluid column or that cannot be 
adjusted to the standard should be 
immediately repaired or replaced.

<DOCNO> FR940128-1-00109 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940128-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. Temperature-Recording Devices 


Temperature-recording devices should be installed where they can be easily read and the sensors for such devices
should be installed to ensure that they accurately measure the warmest temperature of the refrigeration equipment
and the coldest temperature of the heating equipment, as appropriate. Computerized storage of temperature data
may be used in place of recorder thermometer charts if the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to be
substantially equivalent to the use of a temperature-recording device. Each temperature-recording device should
be checked for accuracy at the beginning and end of each production day and adjusted as necessary to agree as nearly
as possible with the reference temperature-indicating device. A record of these accuracy checks should be maintained
that specifies the time, date, temperatures indicated by both devices before adjustment, corrective action taken,
where applicable, and person performing the accuracy check. 


8. Corrective Actions 


Under 21 CFR 123.7, whenever a deviation occurs at a critical control point, the processor shall segregate and hold
the product until a review can be made to determine the effect of that deviation, and shall take corrective action as
necessary. For cooked, ready-to-eat products, when a deviation occurs at a cooking or pasteurization critical control
point, the processor should meet the requirements of  123.7 either by destroying the product; by fully reprocessing,
where possible, that portion of the production involved, keeping full records of the reprocessing conditions; or
by setting aside that portion of the product involved for further evaluation as to any potential public health significance.
Such an evaluation should be made by a process authority and should be in accordance with procedures recognized by
process authorities as being adequate to detect any unacceptable hazard to public health. Unless this evaluation
demonstrates that the product had been given a thermal process that rendered it free of microorganisms of potential
public health significance or, in the case of pasteurization, that resulted in the adequate reduction in numbers
of microorganisms, the product set aside should be either fully reprocessed to correct the deficiency or destroyed.
A record should be made of the evaluation procedures used and the results. Either upon completion of full reprocessing
or after the determination that no significant public health hazard exists, that portion of the product involved
may be shipped in normal distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the product involved should be destroyed. 


9. Sanitary Zones 


In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 123.10, sanitary zones should be established around areas in which cooked
product is handled or stored. In such areas, objects and employees that have come into contact with waste, raw product,
or other insanitary objects are excluded. Packaging material, equipment, employees, and in-process materials
that enter a sanitary zone should be treated in a manner that will minimize the risk of the introduction of microorganisms.
Air handling systems should be designed to minimize the risk of airborne contamination and to provide positive air
pressure in the sanitary zone relative to the surrounding areas.

1. General Guidelines for Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 


This Appendix provides guidance on how to meet the requirements of 21 CFR part 123, subpart A for fish and fishery products
that consist in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species. These include tuna, bluefish, mahi mahi, mackerel,
sardines, herring, kahawai, anchovies, marlin, and other species, whether or not of the family Scombridae, in which
significant levels of histamine may be produced in the fish flesh by decarboxylation of free histidine as a result
of exposure of the fish after capture to temperatures that permit the growth of mesophilic bacteria. The guidance
focuses on preventing the formation of scombrotoxin, which can be harmful to humans, as a consequence of improper
handling after capture, i.e., time and temperature abuse. 


2. Critical Control Points 


Every processor who engages in processing other than, or in addition to, storing of fish or fishery products that consist
in whole or in part of scombroid forming species, must ensure that neither decomposition leading to histamine formation,
nor histamine formation, has occurred before receipt of such fish or fishery products. Processors must also ensure
that neither decomposition leading to histamine formation, nor histamine formation, occurs as a result of inadequate
handling practices by the processor. In order to prevent these hazards from occurring, Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point (HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with 21 CFR part 123, subpart A will typically identify and address
the receipt of raw materials, as well as processing, as critical control points. In accordance with 21 CFR part 123,
subpart A, processors shall identify in their HACCP plans how they will control hazards at critical control points.
This appendix provides guidance on how to do so with respect to scombroid toxin forming species. 


3. Receipt of Raw Materials Critical Control Point 


a. First Processor 


1. 

On-board handling. 

The first processor to take ownership after harvest of fish and fishery products of scombroid toxin forming species
should ensure that vessels supplying such fish have in place measures to ensure that the fish were rapidly brought
to, and maintained at, an internal temperature of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below, and were not held for a period of time sufficient to allow histamine formation to begin at the temperature
at which they were held. The processor may determine the time and temperature history of the fish by requiring certification
of the fishing method and on-board handling practices, and a time/temperature log from the harvesting vessel. The
time/temperature log should record, for each lot of fish, the date of harvest, fishing method, temperature of the
harvest water, and temperature history of the fish relating to the lowering of the internal temperature. The temperature
history of the fish may be documented by controlling and recording the key aspects of the cooling and storage operation
(e.g., refrigerated brine or seawater temperature, fish size, and container packing). For purposes of this guideline,
a lot of fish is the fish in a vessel storage compartment (i.e., well, tote, or other container). The log should be sufficient
to enable the processor to determine whether the fish were subject to conditions in the water after capture, on the
harvesting vessel, or in storage, that could cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine in
the fish.

2. 

Sampling and examination.

 The first 
processor, as described in section 3.a.1. of 
this Appendix, should subject a 
representative sample of fish in each lot 
from the vessel to an external organoleptic 
examination for decomposition and should 
record the results of the examination. A 
representative sample should provide at least 
95 percent confidence that decomposition does 
not exist in more than 2.5 percent of the 
fish in the lot. If the number of fish from 
a vessel is small enough to permit an 
examination of each fish, e.g., because the 
weight of each fish is typically greater than 
10 pounds, the processor is encouraged to 
examine each fish. 

i. Any fish that exhibits decomposition 
should either be rejected and not used for 
food, or reconditioned according to the 
processor's established procedures. 
Reconditioning should include, at a minimum, 
removal of all parts of the fish that exhibit 
any decomposition, organoleptic reexamination 
of the remaining fish flesh, and the 
performance of a histamine analysis on the 
remaining fish flesh. 

ii. If no decomposition in any fish in 
a lot is detected through organoleptic 
examination, the following should apply: 

A. If the time/temperature log as 
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
were unlikely to cause, or significantly 
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
the fish, all the fish from that lot may be 
further processed or enter commerce. 

B. If the time/temperature log as 
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
were likely to cause, or significantly 
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
the fish in a lot, or if no adequate 
time/temperature log is available, a 
histamine analysis should be made on a 
representative sample of fish from that lot. 

iii. If decomposition is detected in 
less than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, 
the following should apply: 

A. If the time/temperature log as 
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
were unlikely to cause, or significantly 
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
the fish in a particular lot, those fish from 
that lot found to have decomposition should 
be treated in accordance with section 
3.a.2.i. of this Appendix. Other fish from 
that lot may be further processed or enter 
commerce. 

B. If the time/temperature log as 
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
were likely to cause, or significantly 
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
the fish in a particular lot, or if no 
adequate time/temperature log is available, 
the processor should perform a histamine 
analysis on a representative sample of 
organoleptically acceptable fish from that 
lot. (However, if the processor elects to 
perform a histamine analysis on a 
representative sample of each lot of fish 
from the vessel before conducting an 
organoleptic analysis for decomposition 
because, for example, the processor received 
the fish in a frozen state, the histamine 
analysis does not have to be repeated based 
on results of subsequent organoleptic 
analysis.) 

iv. If decomposition is detected in 
more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a 
particular lot, the processor should perform 
a histamine analysis on a representative 
sample of organoleptically acceptable fish 
from that lot. 

3. 

Histamine Findings.

i. If any fish from a particular lot is 
found to have histamine above a defect action 
level or other regulatory level or limit for 
histamine established by FDA, the fish in 
that lot may not be used for food. 

ii. If any fish from a particular lot 
is found to have histamine below the defect 
action level or other regulatory level or 
limit for histamine established by FDA but 
above levels expected of fresh fish, the fish 
from that lot should enter commerce only if 
first immediately cooked to prevent histamine 
from increasing to unacceptable levels. 



b. Subsequent Processors 



1. Processor evaluations

. All 
subsequent processors who take ownership of 
fish and fish products of scombroid toxin 
forming species and who engage in processing 
other than, or in addition to, storage, 
should subject a representative sample each 
lot of such fish and fishery products to 
organoleptic evaluation for decomposition to 
determine whether decomposition occurred 
during transfer from the previous processor. 
Any fish that exhibits decomposition should 
be treated in accordance with section 
3.a.2.i. of this Appendix.

2. 

Decomposition

. A finding of any 
organoleptically detectable decomposition 
should result in the organoleptic examination 
of the entire lot. If decomposition is 
detected in more than 2.5 percent of the fish 
in the lot, the processor should perform a 
histamine analysis on a representative sample 
of fish from the lot. The results should be 
treated in accordance with section 3.a.3. of 
this Appendix. 

4. Processing Critical Control Point.

Products that are undergoing processing 
should not be exposed to ambient temperatures 
of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or higher for more than a 
cumulative total of 4 hours. Processors 
should ensure that this requirement is met by 
monitoring and recording, at least every 2 
hours, the length of time that the product is 
exposed to temperatures of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or 
higher. 

5. Additional Critical Control Points.

The guidelines relating to cooked ready 
to eat fish and fishery products specified by 
Appendix A, sections 6 and 7 should also be 
applied to scombroid toxin forming species, 
where applicable. 



Appendix C to Part 123_[Reserved] 

Appendix D to Part 123_Product Integrity 



1. General guidelines for product integrity.

2. Product integrity critical control 
points. 



1. General Guidelines for Product Integrity 



This Appendix provides guidance on how a 
processor can use an HACCP-based approach to 
ensure that all fish and fishery products are 
in compliance with the economic adulteration 
and misbranding provisions of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 402(b) 
and 403, respectively). This guidance 
applies to controlling economic factors 
including the identity of species, weight, 
count and size, and the percentage of 
valuable constituents. These factors must be 
accurately represented on the label and 
labeling of a food. 



2. Product Integrity Critical Control Points



Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
(HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with 
subpart A of 21 CFR part 123 will typically include the following critical control 
points, as appropriate, that can be used to 
ensure the economic integrity of the product: 



a. Receipt of Raw Material



A processor must ensure that the fish 
and fishery products that it receives are 
correctly identified as to species at the 
point of receipt into its processing 
facility. Methods used for identification 
upon receipt may include, but are not limited 
to: 

1. 

Exams.

 Physical examination of the 
seafood species by qualified personnel; 

2. 

Evaluations. 

Laboratory evaluation 
(e.g., protein chromatography); and 

3. Acceptance of species identity as 
certified by a supplier under either a 
Limited or a General and Continuing Guaranty, 
as provided for by section 303(c)(2) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 CFR 
7.12 and 7.13). 



b. Labeling-Economic Value 



A processor must ensure that the 
finished product labels, labeling, and 
invoices accurately represent the weight, 
count, and size of the product, as well as the presence and amount of any valuable constituents. An example would be
the 
handling of shrimp and breading material to 
make breaded shrimp. The processor must 
ensure that the shrimp has not been 
adulterated by the addition of water, and 
that the valuable constituents are present at 
levels that are consistent with FDA standards 
of identity (21 CFR part 161) and compliance 
policy guides. The processor thus should 
provide for monitoring of the level of the 
valuable constituents throughout receipt, 
processing, and distribution to ensure that: 

1. 

Identification. 

The species is 
correctly identified by its common or usual 
name and is so represented on the label and 
labeling. Guidance in selecting the correct 
common or usual name of a species is provided 
by the FDA Fish List. Specific requirements 
are given in 21 CFR 101.18 and 21 CFR part 
161. 

2. 

Valuable constituents.

 The valuable 
constituents of the product are not omitted 
or abstracted from the product (e.g., breaded 
shrimp contains the required weight ratio of 
shrimp to breading and, if appropriate, shrimp of the size and weight specified on 
the label or labeling). 

3. 

Substitution.

 No substance is 
substituted wholly or in part for the 
valuable constituent (e.g., through added 
water or glazing, or substitution of crab 
flavored surimi for crab meat in a product 
labeled as crab cake). 

4. 

Damage or inferiority. 

Damage or 
inferiority is not concealed in any manner 
(e.g., through bleaching or coloring of 
product to conceal its true nature or 
condition of wholesomeness). 

5. 

Product adulteration. 

No substance 
is added to, or mixed with, the product to 
increase its bulk or weight or to reduce its 
quality, or make it appear of better or 
greater value than it is (e.g., through 
adding water to a product by chemical or 
other means).

they were harvested, including the number assigned to the 
harvester by the shellfish control authority. Any raw molluscan 
shellfish that are found by FDA in interstate commerce without 
such a tag or label, or with a tag or label that does not bear 
all the required information, will be subject to seizure and 
destruction.

(c) Shucked molluscan shellfish shall be subject to the 
same requirements as apply to molluscan shellfish that has not

Appendix 1_FDA Fish Fishery Products Hazard and Controls Guide Including Guidance on Smoked Fish 



FDA is in the process of developing guidance to, among 
other things, assist the seafood industry develop and implement 
HACCP systems. The guidance will be titled 
the ``FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazard 
and Controls Guide.'' When a draft of the entire Guide is completed in the near future, FDA will publish a notice 
of availability in the 

Federal Register

 and invite public 
comment. FDA will revise the draft as warranted and then issue 
the first edition of the Guide. 



I. The Information Presented 



The selected portions of the draft Guide that are provided 
below are: 



Example 1. 

The Table of Contents.


Example 2. 

One page each from the ``Vertebrate'' and 
``Invertebrate Hazard and Control Lists.'' Together, these lists 
contain about 350 species of commercially marketed fish. Each 
list is in the form of a chart that directs the reader to one or 
more of the 10 numbered hazard and control descriptions elsewhere 
in the Guide for species-related hazards. For purposes of the 
Guide, species-related hazards are those that can occur in the 
environment or during harvest. Processors should find in the 
appropriate list the species they handle, then turn to those 
numbered hazard and control descriptions that are relevant to 
that species. 



Example 3. 

A sample of a species-related hazard and 
control description (Species-related Hazard and Control 

#

1 
(Chemical Contamination)). Each description explains a hazard 
and the measures available to control it, with an emphasis on 
HACCP controls such as critical control points, critical limits, 
monitoring procedures and frequencies, recordkeeping, and 
corrective actions. Some descriptions contain several control 
options.

Example 4. 

One page from the ``Process-related Hazards and Controls List.'' For purposes of this Guide, process-related hazards
are those that can occur because of the nature of the processing procedures and the finished product form. This list
includes 20 types of finished products (e.g., cooked shrimp) and directs the reader to one or more of the 22 process-related
hazard and control descriptions, which are located in the next part of the Guide. 
The process-related hazard and control descriptions are numbered. Some of them are further subdivided into lettered
portions. Where the reader need only refer to a portion of a process-related hazard and control description, the list
directs the reader to that portion by referring to a lettered part of the description. See below. 


Example 5. 

A sample of a process-related hazard and control description (``Process-related Hazard and Control 

#

11'' (pathogen survival during pasteurization)). As with the species-related descriptions discussed above, each
process-related description explains a hazard and the measures available to control it, with an emphasis on HACCP
controls. Some of these descriptions are subdivided. For example, ``Process-related Hazard and Control No. 8,''
which is about temperature abuse, is subdivided into ``8a: Histamine,'' ``8b: Pathogens,'' and ``8c: Decomposition.''
Where the list in 4. above directs a reader to a number-letter combination, e.g., ``8b,'' it is to one of the subdivided
portions of a description, in this case to the ``Pathogens'' material in Process-related Hazards and Controls 

#

Example 6. 

A consolidated section for smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. 


Example 7. 

A model HACCP plan. This is essentially a fill-in-the-blank model. Processors can use the materials in the hazards
and controls descriptions and this model plan, to develop much if not all of their HACCP plans, depending on their circumstances.

It must be remembered that these materials reflect a work in progress and are published to provide the public with a
preview of the document. When the entire document is made available to the public in the near future, the selected portions
published here may have been revised. 
To help processors and other interested persons to understand the guidance presented in the consolidated section
on smoked fishery products, FDA will explain that guidance in the section that follows. 


II. Smoked Fishery Products 


Research conducted since FDA proposed the 1970 final rule shows that less stringent processing temperatures and
lower water-phase salt content, with or without use of other inhibiting factors such as sodium nitrite, can provide
an adequate margin of safety for hot-process products held in refrigerated storage (40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower). FDA has considered this research, and based on it, the agency is proposing a guidance setting forth
what it tentatively finds are the minimum time, temperature, and salinity requirements to make a safe and marketable
smoked fish product. Proposed TTS parameters are found in example 6 of this appendix. 
A. 

Raw Materials/Handling of Unprocessed Fish. 
The presence of microorganisms, including C. botulinum 

and 

L. monocytogenes, 

cannot be avoided in fresh-water fish and marine fish because they are present in the aquatic environment. Under certain
conditions, the potential exists for the outgrowth of 

C. botulinum 

spores and toxin production (Refs. 148 through 152), as well as for an increase in the 

L. monocytogenes 

population (Ref. 143). 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940128-1-00115 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940128-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To minimize microbial growth, fresh fish should be 
maintained at refrigerated temperatures close to 38 
 F (3.3 
 C) 
(Refs. 173 and 175). Although certain strains of 

C. botulinum 


are capable of growth at temperatures as low as 38 
 F (3.3 
 C), 
favorable growth media are necessary for a significant growth 
rate to occur at this temperature. For example, it has been 
shown that 

C. botulinum 

Type E requires 31 to 35 days before 
outgrowth and toxin production occurs in a beef stew media held 
at 38 
 F. However, outgrowth and toxin production in a cooked 
meat medium held at 41 
 F does not occur until after 56 days, 
demonstrating that less favorable growth media can significantly 
lower the rate of growth. Even in those cases where 

C. botulinum 


does grow and produce toxin, the laboratory conditions are 
generally more ideally suited to growth than those found in 
nonexperimental situations where less favorable growth 
environments prevail. Thus, while the growth of 

C. botulinum 

is 
not completely inhibited at 40 
 F (4.4 
 C), under the less than 
ideal conditions for its growth that are generally encountered in 
the processing of smoked fish, FDA has tentatively concluded that 
maintaining fresh fish at a maximum temperature of 40 
 F, only 2 
degrees above the temperature of complete growth inhibition, 
before and during processing will provide adequate protection 
against 

C. botulinum 

outgrowth. Moreover, 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) is 
consistent with the maximum temperature FDA has proposed in 
various guidelines, such as the Unicode (now called the Food 
Code) (53 FR 16472, May 9, 1988). Therefore, under proposed 
 123.10(a)(14), all raw fish that is to be smoked must be 
refrigerated until needed for processing (Ref. 175). 
Similarly, fish that are initially frozen need to remain in 
the frozen state until needed for processing (Refs. 161 and 25). 
When frozen fish are needed for processing, the thawing procedure 
must be carried out in a way that minimizes the opportunity for 
microbial growth (Refs. 161 and 171). The method used to thaw 
the fish must provide an environment that will inhibit the growth 
of 

C. botulinum 

and other microorganisms that pose a potential 
health hazard (Refs. 171 and 172). Thus, the fish should be 
thawed in a way that ensures that the internal temperature at the 
core of the fish does not exceed 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) (Refs. 171 and 
172). Therefore, section 4.a. of Example 6 of this appendix, the 
agency suggests that this procedure be used in the thawing 
process. 


B. Manufacturing Operations


Reduction of the potential health hazard from 

C. botulinum 


spore outgrowth and toxin production in smoked and smoke-flavored 
fish relies on the interrelationship of processing time, 
processing temperature, water-phase salt concentration in the 
loin muscle, and smoke (or constituents of smoke) deposition, 
combined with refrigerated storage (40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower) (see 
proposed  123.10(a)(14)) (Ref. 173). At one time, smoking and 
associated brining may have been an effective preservation 
method. With the changes in processing techniques that have 
occurred since the advent of refrigeration and in response to 
consumers' demands for products with certain organoleptic 
qualities, however, smoked fish products, either hot- or 
cold-process, have become perishable products that must be 
refrigerated and cannot be considered preserved foods (Ref. 173). 
The changes that have occurred, both in processing techniques and 
in organoleptic qualities, have resulted in products that are 
more moist and contain less salt. As a result, the two critical 
processing factors that affect the overall preservation and 
safety of the product have been altered. The processing 
time-temperature parameters have been decreased, and the 
water-phase salt content has been reduced (Ref. 173). Therefore, 
these products need to be maintained at refrigerated temperatures 
(40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower) or frozen immediately after processing 
to ensure the overall quality of these products (Ref. 173). 
1. 

Brining/dry salting. 

Salt, as a preservative in smoked 
and smoke-flavored fish, is somewhat limited in its effectiveness 
because of the variability in salt uptake by fish flesh, even 
among fish in the same brining tank. Ventral muscle, which is 
thin, absorbs high levels of salt, while the thicker dorsal 
muscles absorb less salt, limiting the effectiveness of salt as a 
deterrent against spore outgrowth in that part of the fish. 
Equilibration techniques, such as two-stage brining, reduce 
variation in salt content within a fish and increase the 
preservative effect (Ref. 176). 
It is possible that salt-tolerant microorganisms of public 
health concern (such as strains of 

Staphylococcus

) may grow 
during brining or after the dry salting process. Therefore, FDA 
is providing in section 5.c. and 5.e. in example 6 of this 
appendix that the brining and dry salting of fish be carried out 
at refrigerated temperatures, i.e., 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower. 
Doing so will ensure that the environment in which brining is 
done, and in which fish are held after dry-salting, will inhibit 
the growth of salt-tolerant microorganisms that can cause a 
potential health hazard (Ref. 173). 
FDA recognizes that when fish are initially added to the 
brine, the temperature of the brine may increase. It is 
essential to this process that the brine be returned to 
refrigerated temperatures 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower to reduce the 
opportunity of microbial growth and to ensure the overall quality 
of the product during the brining process (Refs. 175 and 182). 
Therefore, the agency is suggesting in section 5.d. of Example 6 
of this appendix that the temperature of the brine not exceed 60 

 F (16 
 C) at the start of brining.

<PARENT> FR940128-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To minimize the variation in salt content of the fish, the 
agency is recommending in section 5.f. of Example 6 of this 
appendix that only fish of the same species and of similar size 
and similar weight be brined in the same tank (Refs. 171 and 
199). Because reuse of brine solutions is a possible route of 
microbial contamination of raw fish, the agency is providing in 
section 5.g. of Example 6 of this appendix that brines not be 
reused unless they have been processed in some way to return them 
to a microbiological quality equivalent to the original, unused 
brine made with potable water and food-grade salt. The agency is 
also providing in section 5.h. of Example 6 of this appendix that 
a processor may rinse the brined fish with fresh water to remove 
any unwanted excess salt on the exterior of the fish. 
2. 

Drying. 

Fish that are to be processed as smoked or 
smoke-flavored fish are dried after brining to remove excess 
water and prevent dripping during smoking. The drying process, 
usually of several hours in duration, provides another 
opportunity for microbial growth. Therefore, to minimize the 
opportunity for microbial growth by reducing those conditions 
that would provide a favorable environment for such growth, the 
agency is providing in section 5.i. of Example 6 of this appendix 
that the presmoking drying step should be conducted in a 
refrigerated room (Ref. 46). 
3. 

Smoking.

 Smoke deposition, like water-phase salt 
content, is very difficult to control. Constituents of smoke 
called ``inhibitory compounds'' (such as phenolic compounds) are 
reported to have a bactericidal effect (Ref. 177). Factors that 
affect the quantity of inhibitory compounds deposited on the fish 
surface and the degree of penetration by those compounds into the 
fish are the humidity in the smoking chamber, the temperature of 
smoking, and the air flow in the smoking chamber (Ref. 178). 
Decreased levels of inhibitory compounds reduce the preservative 
effect of the smoke and make dependence on these compounds 
inadvisable (Ref. 178). In general, smoked products are not 
shelf stable and must be either refrigerated at a temperature of 
40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower or frozen immediately after processing 
(Refs. 43, 45, and 178). 
To promote uniform deposition of smoke, heat exposure, and 
dehydration, and to ensure that on completion of these processes, 
the fish do not contain any raw or wet sections that would create 
an environment favorable for microbial growth and spoilage, the 
agency is providing in section 5.j. of Example 6 of this appendix 
that fish should be arranged in the smokehouse chamber or oven so 
that they are not overcrowded or touching each other, and that 
only fish of like size and weight should be included in a single 
batch of fish for smoking. 
Liquid smoke, a solution of wood smoke that, when diluted, 
may be used to impart a smoke flavor to fish products, is often 
used as an alternative to generated smoke. Liquid smoke has been 
reported to have similar antibacterial properties to, and some 
advantages over, generated smoke (Ref. 26). It is easier to 
apply uniformly, and the inhibitory compounds penetrate further 
into the fish flesh (Ref. 26). Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or 
a combination of liquid smoke and generated smoke needs to be 
applied to all surfaces of fish to be smoked. Liquid smoke may 
be applied to the product before, at the commencement of, or 
during the process, while generated smoke needs to be applied to 
the fish during the first half of the process and longer if 
necessary (Refs. 178 and 179). If a combination of liquid smoke 
and generated smoke is used, the method for use of liquid smoke 
may be followed, and the generated smoke may be applied at any 
stage of the process (Ref. 26). The agency is providing for the 
use of liquid smoke alone or in combination with generated smoke 
in section 3.c.2. of Example 6 of this appendix to impart smoke 
flavor and antibacterial properties to the products. 
4. 

Use of sodium nitrite.

 Use of sodium nitrite in smoked 
and smoke-flavored fish products is limited to the species listed 
in  172.175 (21 CFR 172.175) and to chubs in  172.177 (21 CFR 
172.177). Section 172.175 permits the use of sodium nitrite as a 
preservative and color fixative in cured, smoked sablefish, 
salmon, and shad. However, it requires that the level of sodium 
nitrite in the final product not exceed 200 ppm. Use of sodium 
nitrite substantially reduces the level of salt necessary to 
inhibit outgrowth of 

C. botulinum 

type A and type E spores, 
although the levels vary because of the difference in heat 
resistance between the two types of spores (Ref. 179). The 
quantity of sodium nitrite necessary to achieve inhibition is 
affected by both the level of contamination and the resistance of 
the spores (Refs. 179 and 180). Refrigeration of the finished 
product at temperatures of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below is necessary 
to retain the inhibitory characteristic gained through use of 
sodium nitrite (Ref. 179). Therefore, in accordance with the 
provisions of   172.175 and 172.177, the agency is proposing to 
provide for the use of sodium nitrite in the processing and 
packaging of smoked and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a. and 
section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix.

5. 

Vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging. 

Vacuum 
packaging and other types of modified atmosphere-packaging (those in which the air in the package or container is

replaced by one or more gases, in various concentrations, before 
the package is sealed) extend the shelf life of foods markedly. 
However, the anaerobic environment created in these types of 
packaging favors the outgrowth of 

C. botulinum 

spores and 
subsequent toxin production, and it inhibits growth of aerobic 
microorganisms that might otherwise serve as organoleptic 
indicators of spoilage (Refs. 180 and 182). Consequently, use of 
vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging demands strict adherence 
to temperature-controlled storage and distribution to reduce the 
opportunity for spore outgrowth and toxin production and to 
reduce the potential growth of other microorganisms of public 
health significance (such as 

L. monocytogenes

). 
Two methods of reducing the potential public health hazard 
of vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged smoked, smoke-flavored, 
and salted fish products are: (1) To store and distribute the 
products frozen or, alternatively, (2) to use in-package heat 
processing followed by refrigeration. At freezer temperatures, 
outgrowth of spores of 

C. botulinum 

types B, E, and F is retarded 
(Refs. 171, 173, and 180). Type A does not grow below 50 
 F (10 

 C) (Refs. 179 and 180). Storage and distribution in the frozen 
state reduces the possibility that temperature abuse will occur. 

In-package heat processing, sometimes referred to as ``heat 
pasteurization,'' at temperatures in the range of 185 
 F (85 
 C) 
for 85 minutes to 198 
 F (92 
 C) for 55 minutes, inhibits 
outgrowth and toxin production by type E spores (Ref. 185). 
Longer exposure to processing temperatures is required for more 
heat resistant spores, such as types B and A (Ref. 185). In a 
study examining this method of packaging, samples of hot-process 
salmon steaks were injected with spores of nonproteolytic strains 
of 

C. botulinum 

types B and E (Ref. 185). The steaks were vacuum 
packaged, heat pasteurized, then incubated using different 
time-temperature combinations. The results of this research 
showed that closely controlled in-package heat processing extends 
the shelf life of the product, inactivates nonproteolytic 

C

. 


botulinum 

types B, E, and F and other vegetative pathogens, and 
maintains product quality attributes. However, this process is 
more suitable for pieces, fillets, and steaks than for whole 
eviscerated fish because this process causes the flesh to 
separate from the backbone (Ref. 185). 


C. Specific Processing Conditions


The various processing techniques used to produce smoked and 
smoke-flavored fish are affected by the interrelationship of the 
smoking, the method of smoke application, the time-temperature 
combinations used, and the water-phase salt content. A critical 
factor in determining alternative processing methods is the type 
of packaging utilized, specifically whether the product is 
air-packaged or vacuum-packaged. The following discussion sets 
out the various processing procedures that the agency has 
tentatively concluded will ensure the safety of hot-process 
smoked and smoke-flavored fish, and cold-process smoked and 
smoke-flavored fish. 
1. 

Hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish. 

a. 


Air-packaged. 

Research data and industry practice show that a 
lower minimum water-phase salt content (3.5 percent or lower), in 
combination with lower processing temperatures (lower than 180 
 F 
(82 
 C)) than cited in the 1970 final rule for hot-process 
products are effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth and toxin 
production when the products are not vacuum-packaged and are held 
at refrigerated temperatures (40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or lower) (Refs. 24, 
163, and 177). Research studies from the National Marine 
Fisheries Service and testimony presented at a public hearing 
held by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets 
on May 3, 1989, to establish a CGMP for the manufacture of smoked 
and smoke-flavored fish products, show that 

C. botulinum 

type E 
is inhibited in air-packaged smoked fish products when the 
water-phase salt content is at least 3.0 percent, and the 
processing internal temperature of the product is maintained at a 
minimum of 145 
 F (63 
 C) for at least 30 minutes (Ref. 180). In 
light of these findings, FDA is setting forth these processing 
parameters in Example 6 of this appendix to provide guidance on 
the safe manufacturing of these products. 
The agency is setting forth the following minimum T-T-S 
parameters for air-packed, hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored 
fish in section 5.a.1. of Example 6 of this appendix: Heating at 
an internal temperature of 145 
 F (63 
 C) for 30 minutes with a 
water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent in the finished product. 
b. 

Vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere.

 For 
vacuum-packaged products, National Marine Fisheries Service 
research shows that processing temperatures in the range of 145 
to 175
  F (63 to 80 
 C) for hot-process smoked fish will inhibit 


C. botulinum

 type E when the water-phase salt content is greater 
than 3.5 percent (Refs. 26, 173, and 180). Based on this 
evidence, New York's CGMP included a procedure for processing 
vacuum-packaged smoked fish that specifies heating the fish to an 
internal temperature of 145 
 F (63 
 C) for 30 minutes, with a 
water-phase salt content of 3.5 percent (Ref. 25). 
The use of sodium nitrite in combination with sodium 
chloride significantly inhibits the outgrowth and toxin 
production of 

C. botulinum 

type E. Research data show that when 
the water-phase salt content and sodium nitrite content are at 
least 3.1 percent and 100 ppm, respectively, and the internal 
temperature of the fish is not less than 145 
 F, the inhibitory 
effect on 

C. botulinum 

growth and toxin production greatly 
increases (Refs. 173 and 179). At higher processing 
temperatures, e.g., 180 
 F (82 
 C), a water-phase salt content of 
3.0 percent or more inhibits toxin formation by 

C. botulinum 

type 
E (Ref. 163). 
Based on this information, the agency is setting forth the 
following T-T-S parameters for vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked 
and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this 
appendix: (1) Heating at an internal temperature of at least 
145 
 F (63 
 C) for 30 minutes with a minimum water-phase salt 
content of 3.5 percent in the finished product, or (2) heating 
at an internal temperature of at least 145 
 F (63 
 C) for 30 
minutes, with a minimum water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent, 
and a sodium nitrite content of 100 to 200 ppm (as permitted by 
the food additive regulations in  172.175) in the finished 
product, or (3) as described in  172.177 for smoked chub 
containing sodium nitrite.

<TEXT>
 

The agency points out that these processing parameters for 
vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish are 
minimums. Unless the comments on Example 6 of this appendix 
convince the agency otherwise, fish that have been processed at a 
lower temperature or with a lower water-phase salt level could 
provide the basis for regulatory action on the grounds that the 
product has been processed under conditions whereby it may have 
been reduced injurious to health and thus could represent a 
hazard for consumers. 
2. 

Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish. 


Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish, by virtue of the 
temperatures used in processing, are not cooked because they are 
processed at temperatures lower than those that coagulate 
protein, i.e., 100 
 F (38 
 C) or lower. Because these 
temperatures are not high enough to inactivate 

C. botulinum 


spores, and because they provide a favorable environment for 
other food spoilage microorganisms, other inhibitive factors, 
such as higher salt content and sodium nitrite (where permitted 
by food additive regulations in  172.175) need to be used. 
The time and temperature relationship in the processing of 
cold-smoked and smoke-flavored fish is a critical factor in 
yielding a microbiologically safe and high quality finished 
product (Ref. 182). Modern establishments that cold-smoked fish 
generally process between 40 
 F (5 
 C) and 100 
 F (38 
 C) for 18 
to 24 hours (Refs. 171 and 182). Based on the research data that 
are available and the requirements in the New York CGMP, the 
agency is proposing the following requirements for air-packaged 
and vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere cold-process smoked and 
smoke-flavored fish (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
a. 

Air-packaged products. 

The agency is providing in 
section 5.a.3. of Example 6 of this appendix that air-packed, 
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should have a minimum 
water-phase salt content of: (1) 3.5 percent, or (2) 3.0 
percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite in the 
finished product, or (3) 2.5 percent in the finished product if 
the product is frozen immediately after processing and cooling 
and is kept frozen throughout holding and distribution. The 
agency is providing that the finished product that contains a 
water-phase salt content of 2.5 percent should be frozen 
immediately and kept frozen to ensure the microbiological safety 
of the product, as well as to maintain the shelf-life of the 
finished product. 
As stated above, because these products are not cooked and 
contain a low water-phase salt content, these products may 
present a potential public health hazard because they provide an 
ideal environment for the outgrowth of 

C. botulinum 

spores and 
toxin production. Therefore, based on the discussion above, the 
agency is suggesting that air-packaged cold-process smoked and 
smoke-flavored fish be processed under one of the following sets 
of conditions: (1) A maximum 20-hour drying and smoking period 
with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 90 
 F 
(32 
 C) (section 5.a.3.i. of Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) 
a maximum 24-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature 
in the smoking chamber not exceeding 50 
 F (10 
 C) (section 
5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this appendix) except that sablefish 
needs to be heated to a temperature not to exceed 120 
 F (49 
 C) 
for a period not to exceed 6 hours (section 5.a.3.iii. of example 
6 of this appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
b. 

Vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged products. 

FDA is 
providing in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of this appendix that 
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish to be vacuum- or 
modified atmosphere-packaged should have a minimum water-phase 
salt content of: (1) 3.0 percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of 
sodium nitrite in the finished product, or (2) 3.5 percent in 
the finished product when no sodium nitrite is used. The agency 
is also providing that vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged 
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should be processed 
under one of the following sets of conditions: (1) A maximum 
20-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the 
smoking chamber not exceeding 90 
 F (32 
 C) (section 5.a.3.i. of 
Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) a maximum 24-hour drying and 
smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not 
exceeding 50 
 F (10 
 C) (section 5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this 
appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
The agency again points out that these processing parameters 
for vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged cold-process smoked and 
smoke-flavored fish are minimums. Failure to adhere to these 
parameters could provide the basis for regulatory action because 
the product that results may be injurious to health and thus 
could represent a hazard to consumers.

<TEXT>
 

The agency believes that the proposed processing 
requirements for cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored products, 
air-packed and vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged, will 
produce a safe and commercially acceptable product. However, 
because less data and information are available for these 
products than for hot-process products, the agency is requesting 
specific comments, data, and information about these processing 
parameters and any alternative processing parameters that should 
be included in the guideline. 

3. 

Cooling and storage of finished products.

 Rapid cooling 
and storage at temperatures of 40 
 F (4.4 
 C) or below are 
essential for all smoked, smoke-flavored, and salted fish 
products to minimize microbial growth. The exceptions are 
cold-process air-packaged products that contain a water-phase 
salt content of 2.5 percent, which should be frozen immediately 
after processing and remain frozen throughout distribution 
because of the lower water-phase salt content and lower 
processing temperatures that may provide an opportunity for food 
spoilage microorganisms to flourish during storage (see section 
5.a.3. of Example 6 of this appendix) and the discussion above).

Outgrowth of 

C. botulinum

 spores, types A and proteolytic B, 
and toxin production are inhibited at temperatures of 50 
 F (10 

 C) and lower. Spore types E and nonproteolytic B are completely 
inhibited at temperatures of 38 
 F (3.3 
 C) and lower (Refs. 174 
and 185 through 188). 

At section 6 of Example 6 of the appendix, the agency is 
recommending specific time/temperature controls for processing 
after smoking. These proposed controls are the same as those 
proposed for after cooking in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of 
this document (Appendix A, section 6). A full discussion of the 
controls is provided in section VII.J.3. of this document. 

4. 

Alternative processing parameters.

 As this preamble 
indicates, FDA has tentatively concluded that the TTS processing 
parameters reflected in this appendix are the minimum necessary 
to ensure that these products are free from botulinum toxin over 
their shelf life. FDA has also tentatively concluded that the 
T-T-S parameters, coupled with good sanitation practices, will 
also render these products listeria free. Nonetheless, the 
agency does not wish to discourage the development and use of 
alternative procedures that are capable of achieving the same 
outcome. 

Consequently, section 11 of Example 6 of this appendix calls 
for the use of alternative processing parameters when the user 
can demonstrate the following: (1) For botulism, zero toxin 
production slightly beyond the expected shelf life of the 
product, demonstrated through inoculated pack studies under 
normal and moderate abuse conditions and (2) for listeria, no 
detectable 

L. monocytogenes

 in the final product. The data 
demonstrating these outcomes would have to be available to FDA to 
enable the agency to determine whether they have been achieved. 

Example 6 of this appendix states that those data should be 
part of a processor's HACCP records. FDA asks for comment on 
whether a third-party scientific expert, or processing authority, 
should be involved in the development of the data that 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the alternative procedure.

5. 

Use of vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging.

 As 
explained above, vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged smoked, 
smoke-flavored, and salted fish products represent an increased 
public health hazard over conventionally packaged products 
because these types of packaging provide the ideal environment 
for spore outgrowth and toxin production. Based on the 
discussion above, the agency states in section 3 of Example 6 of 
this appendix that these types of packaging should be used only 
when: (1) As provided in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this 
appendix the product is a hot-process smoked or smoke-flavored 
product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere-packed, and 
contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished 
product, or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite 
in the finished product (section 4.a.1. of Example 6 of this 
appendix); (2) as provided in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of 
this appendix, the product is a cold-process smoked or 
smoke-flavored product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere- 
packed, and contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the 
finished product or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium 
nitrite. 

The agency is providing in Appendix C, section 8.a. that all 
vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging should be conducted 
within the processing plant where the product is manufactured 
(Ref. 180). FDA considers this limitation appropriate to prevent 
any postprocessing contamination of the product from bacterial 
pathogens and to ensure that the fish will be packaged 
immediately after processing to protect its overall quality. 

6. 

Process monitoring.

 Section 7 of Example 6 of this 
appendix, the agency is recommending specifications for 
temperature indicating and recording devices where they are 
recommended elsewhere in this appendix. These proposed 
specifications are the same as those proposed in Appendix A for 
cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products (Appendix A, section 7). A 
full discussion of these controls is provided in section VII.J.4. 
of the preamble to this document. Temperature indicating and 
recording devices are specifically recommended in section 5.j. 
and 5.k. of Example 6 of this appendix for the control of the 
smoking temperature. 

At section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, the agency is 
recommending specific controls to ensure that the appropriate 
water-phase salt and sodium nitrate levels are achieved. The 
significance of these attributes has already been discussed in 
this document. In section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, 
the agency recommends that a processor perform or obtain a study 
that shows that under certain processing conditions the desired 
water phase salt or sodium nitrite level will reliably be 
achieved. The processor should monitor those processing 
conditions identified by the study as having an impact on the 
ability of the product to achieve the desired level. The study 
should provide critical limits for each of the relevant 
processing conditions (e.g. maximum fish size, minimum soak time, 
minimum salt to product ratio). 

Because of the existence of numerous variables that affect 
the ability of fish to uniformly take up salt and sodium nitrite, 
it may be appropriate for a processor to perform periodic 
finished product water phase salt or sodium nitrite analyses as a 
verification step. The purpose of such analyses would be to 
identify any variables that have an impact on salt or nitrite 
absorption that were not identified by the study. 

7. 

Corrective actions.

 At section 9 of Example 6 of this 
appendix, the agency is recommending corrective action 
procedures. These proposed procedures are the same as those 
proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document 
(Appendix A, section 8). A full discussion of the procedures is 
provided in section VII.J.5 of the preamble to this document. 

8. 

Sanitary zones.

 At section 10 of Example 6 of this 
appendix, the agency is recommending the institution of sanitary 
zones. This proposed control procedure is the same as that 
proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document 
(Appendix A, section 9). A full discussion of the control 
procedure is provided in section VII.J.6 of the preamble to this 
document. 

To further ensure the safety of the product during 
distribution and storage, FDA is considering adopting specific 
package labeling requirements for smoked and smoke-flavored fish 
products to reduce the opportunity of temperature abuse of the 
finished product. The agency requests comments on whether it 
should require that the label of all shipping containers and 
retail packages state that the product is perishable, and, more 
specifically, that the product must be kept refrigerated. FDA 
tentatively finds that such labeling is extremely important to 
ensuring the safe handling of these products, and, therefore, it 
considers it likely that it will require this labeling in the 
final rule. The agency requests comment on whether it should do 
so. The agency also requests comment on whether, if it decides 
to require such a label statement, the statement should specify a 
temperature at which the product should be refrigerated (e.g. 40 

 F (4.4 
 C) or below). The agency is also considering requiring 
that the label of all frozen smoked products state that the 
product must remain frozen, that if the product needs to be 
thawed, it must be thawed at refrigerated temperatures, and that 
the product must not be refrozen. 

FDA has authority to adopt these labeling requirements under 
sections 201(n), 403(a), and 701(a) of the act because these 
sections require the inclusion of facts on the food label that 
are material with respect to consequences that may result from 
use of the product under conditions of use prescribed in the 
label or that are otherwise customary or usual. The agency 
requests comments on whether it is necessary to do so.

Example 3 


Species-Related Hazards and Controls No. 1 


Hazard No. 1 (Safety)_Chemical Contamination Other Than Methyl 
Mercury 


Contamination of Raw Material at Receipt with Pesticides, 
Radioactivity, Toxic Elements, and Industrial Chemicals, Derived 
From the Harvest Area. 


Hazard Statement 


Fish and molluscan shellfish may be harvested from waters 
that are exposed to varying amounts of environmental 
contaminants. Industrial chemicals, pesticides, and many toxic 
elements may accumulate in fish at levels that can cause public 
health problems. Concern for these contaminants primarily 
focuses on fish and shellfish harvested from fresh water, 
estuaries, and near-coastal waters rather than from the open 
ocean. Pesticides and herbicides used near aquaculture 
operations or for other purposes may contaminate fish and fishery 
products. 
Federal tolerances or action levels are established for some 
of the most toxic and persistent contaminants that are found in 
fish and fishery products shipped in interstate commerce. (These 
contaminants and their corresponding limits are listed below.) 
When products exceed these limits, FDA can seize the contaminated 
fish and fishery products. 
States often use the limits for deciding whether to issue 
consumption advisories or to close or classify waters for 
harvesting. Molluscan shellfish waters are controlled by the 
State Shellfish Control Agency (SSCA) or the equivalent in 
foreign countries that have Memoranda of Understanding with the 
United States that permit them to export molluscan shellfish to 
this country. If local or regional contaminants are not covered 
by federal limits, contact local health departments to decide if 
contaminant levels in fish and fishery products are of public 
health concern. 
The control measures provided in this section are 
appropriate for the control of methyl mercury contamination in 
fish, where such contamination is the result of industrial 
contamination in a harvest area. Recommended controls for the 
problem of open ocean species, such as swordfish and shark, 
concentrating methyl mercury from their diet and its diffuse 
presence in the environment are provided in the ``Mercury'' hazard 
section. 


Critical Control Point: Receiving 


There are five options for control at this critical control 
point. 


Option 1 


Where the firm receives wild caught fish, other than 
molluscan shellfish, directly from the fisher or from a supplier 
that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a 
tender or related company that pools fish from various fishers), 
the following applies:


Control Measures 


1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch 
from the fisher upon receipt. 
2. Find out whether the harvest area is closed to fishing 
by foreign, Federal, State or local health authorities due to 
known instances of chemical contamination. 
3. Reject fish that have been caught in a closed area. 


Example 


ABC Fish Co. has contacted the State Department of 
Health and learned that the Long River is closed to 
commercial harvest above Lookout Point, including its 
tributaries, due to the presence of chlordecone 
(Kepone

TM

). The species affected are croaker, 
bluefish, and striped bass. ABC Fish Co., which 
processes these species, will reject any of the listed 
species originating from the area.

<PARENT> FR940128-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Frequency


1. For finding out the location: each lot or batch.
2. For finding out whether the harvest area is closed: before accepting fish from a new area and after that at least quarterly.
3. For rejecting fish: each lot or batch that does not 
meet the critical limit. 


Critical Limits 


Zero tolerance for fish (i.e., accept no fish) harvested 
from areas closed by foreign, State, or local health authorities 
due to chemical contamination.


Records


A record for each lot or batch that shows the harvest area for the fish. Record may be the receipt from the fisher, if it
shows the harvest area, or it may be a notation on another record of the location of harvest for each lot or batch. The
description of the location should be clear enough to show that the fish were harvested from an area that is open to harvesting.
Longitude and latitude may be necessary (e.g., for open ocean harvesting).



Corrective Actions



Destroy or recall product that fails to meet the critical limit.
Any critical limit deviation should cause a timely assessment by management to: Decide whether the process or HACCP
plan needs changing to reduce the risk of recurrence of the deviation, and to take appropriate followup action.



Option 2



Where the firm receives raw fish, other than molluscan shellfish, directly from the aquacultural or maricultural
producer or from a supplier that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a tender or related company
that pools fish from various aquaculturists), the following applies:



Control Measures



1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch of aquacultured fish.

2. Find out the potential for chemical contamination before receipt of the product. This can be done by obtaining or
reviewing the results of analysis of soil, water, and raw fish samples, as needed. Monitor agricultural and industrial
practices in the aquacultural or maricultural production area.

3. Reject fish that have been grown in an area where uses of agricultural or industrial chemicals are likely to have
caused contamination of the growing and harvesting environment or where soil, water, or fish sample results show
chemical contamination.



Example



ABC Fish Co., which receives pond-raised catfish from the Long River delta area, screens potential pond sites either
directly or by obtaining results of the aquaculturists' analyses of soil and water samples.

The samples are analyzed for pesticides, PCB's, dioxins, and petrochemicals. Either ABC Fish Co. representatives
visit each pond to assess the potential for ongoing chemical contamination, or information is obtained from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Extension Service about the use of pesticides and herbicides near each pond. Where there
is a potential for pond contamination, annual samples are collected and analyzed for the same contaminants. Fish
that come from contaminated or suspect ponds are rejected.



Frequency



1. For finding out the location: each lot or batch.

2. For learning the potential for contamination: before accepting fish from a new growing area, and annually, after
that if there is a potential for ongoing contamination of the growing area.

3. For rejecting fish: each lot or batch that does not meet the critical limit.



Critical Limits



Zero tolerance for fish (i.e., accept no fish) produced in an area where uses of agricultural or industrial chemicals
are likely to have caused contamination of the growing and harvesting environment.

Corrective Actions



Destroy or recall product that fails to meet the critical limit.

Any critical limit deviation should cause a timely assessment by management to: Learn whether the process or HACCP
plan needs modification to reduce the risk of recurrence of the deviation, and take appropriate followup action.



Option 3



Where the firm receives fish, other than molluscan shellfish, from someone other than the fisher, aquacultural producer,
or a supplier that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a transportation company that pools
fish from various fishers or aquaculturists), the following applies:



Control Measures



1. Periodically monitor the incoming fish for environmentally persistent organochlorine pesticides which have
the potential to be present in the fish. These should include, but are not limited to: DDT and its degradation products
(DDE, TDE), chlordane, and heptachlor, also similar chlorinated industrial chemicals, such as PCB's and dioxins.
Sampling should represent all suppliers (i.e., three samples per supplier per year).

2. Reject all shipments from suppliers that provide fish that exceed the critical limits unless convincing evidence
can be obtained that only acceptable harvest or growing areas are now being used.



Example



ABC Fish Co. receives brown shrimp from an interstate seafood transportation company. The carrier, which buys the
shrimp directly from the fishers, makes no effort to learn the harvest location. ABC Fish Co. collects three samples
per supplier per year and sends them to a contract laboratory for pesticide screening. When positive test results
are obtained, the firm stops using that supplier.



Frequency



1. For sampling incoming fish: three times per supplier per year.

2. For rejecting fish: each lot or batch that does not meet the critical limit.



 Critical Limits



All limits are for the edible portion of the fish product, and are based on wet weight:

 Aldrin plus dieldrin, chlordane, endrin, heptachlor plus heptachlor epoxide, and chlordecone (Kepone

TM

): 0.3 ppm in edible portion (except chlordecone in crabmeat 0.4 parts per million(ppm)) (CPG 7141.01);

 DDT plus TDE plus DDE: 5 ppm (CPG 7141.01);

 Mirex: 0.1 ppm (CPG 7141.01);

 Toxaphene: 5.0 ppm in edible portion (CPG 7141.01);

 PCB's: 2 ppm [CPG 7108.19 and CFR 109. 30 (A)];

 Methyl mercury: 1 ppm (CPG 7108.07).



Records



Records of analytical results from the firm's own laboratory or contract laboratory(s).



Corrective Actions



Destroy or recall product that fails to meet the critical limit.

Any critical limit deviation should cause a timely assessment by management to: Learn whether the process or HACCP
plan needs changing to reduce the risk of recurrence of the deviation, and take appropriate followup action.



Option 4



Where the firm receives inshell molluscan shellfish, the following applies:



Control Measures



1. Find out the harvest area location from the harvester's tag on the containers of shellfish for each lot or batch of
shellfish.

2. Check the harvester's state commercial fishing license or compare the dealer's certification number to those
listed in the most current edition of the ``Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List (ICSSL).'' If the dealer
is not listed, check for certification with the SSCA or equivalent.

3. Find out whether the harvest area is closed (i.e. 
classified as prohibited) to fishing by a SSCA or equivalent due 
to chemical contamination. 

4. Reject molluscan shellfish harvested from a closed 
(i.e., classified as prohibited) area, or delivered by an 
unlicensed harvester or uncertified dealer, or those not properly 
tagged. 



Example 



The ABC Fish Co. distributes clams, muscles, and 
oysters to restaurants. The shellfish are received 
from other processors. The firm examines the labels of 
the containers in each lot to learn the name, address, 
and certification number of the last processor. This 
information is compared to the ICSSL to confirm that 
the product is from a certified processor. Containers 
from uncertified processors and inadequately labeled 
containers are rejected. Contact the State Department 
of Health to confirm certification for unlisted 
processors. 



Frequency 



1. For finding out the location: each lot or batch. 

2. For checking licenses and certification: each lot or 
batch. 

3. For finding out whether the harvest area is closed: 
before accepting shellfish from a new area and as often after 
that as necessary to ensure accuracy. 

4. For rejecting molluscan shellfish: each lot or batch 
that does not meet the critical limit. 



Critical Limits 



Zero tolerance for molluscan shellfish (i.e., accept no 
molluscan shellfish) harvested from areas closed (i.e. classified 
as prohibited) by a SSCA or equivalent due to chemical 
contamination. 

Zero tolerance for molluscan shellfish (i.e., accept no 
molluscan shellfish) delivered by a harvester that is unlicensed 
or a processor that is not certified by a SSCA or equivalent. 

Zero tolerance for molluscan shellfish (i.e., accept no 
molluscan shellfish) that do not bear a tag on each container 
that contains the following information, at a minimum: 
harvester's name, address, the harvester number assigned by the 
SSCA or equivalent; date of harvest; location of harvest by state 
and site; type and quantity of shellfish. Bulk shipments should 
be identified by a bill-of-lading that contains the same 
information. 



Records 



A record for each lot or batch that shows the information 
from the harvester tag or bill of lading, including: name of 
harvester, address, identification number, the date of harvest, 
location of harvest by state and site, quantity and type of 
shellfish. 



Corrective Actions 



Destroy or recall product which fails to meet the critical 
limit. 

Any critical limit deviation should cause a timely 
assessment by management to: learn whether the process or HACCP 
plan needs changing to reduce the risk of recurrence of the 
deviation, and take appropriate followup action. 



Option 5 



Where the firm receives shucked molluscan shellfish, the 
following applies: 



Control Measures 



1. Find out the name, address, and certification number of 
the last processor from the containers of shucked molluscan 
shellfish in each lot or batch. 

2. Compare the dealer's certification number to those 
listed in the most current edition of the ``Interstate Certified 
Shellfish Shippers List'' (ICSSL), which is published monthly. If 
the dealer is not listed, check for certification with the SSCA 
or equivalent. 

3. Reject molluscan shellfish not from a dealer certified 
by a SSCA or equivalent, packed in containers not bearing the 
name, address, and certification number of the last processor.

Process-Related Hazard and Control No. 11 


Hazard No. 11 (Safety)_Pathogen Survival During Pasteurization 

Hazard Statement 



Survival of 

Clostridium botulinum

 (

C. botulinum

 type E) or 
other microorganisms of public health concern, through the 
pasteurization process is a food safety hazard for cooked, ready-to-eat products packed in hermetically sealed
containers and held 
refrigerated. Pasteurization is a process applied to a fish or 
fishery product after that fish or fishery product has been 
placed in a final, hermetically sealed package. The process 
involves the application of sufficient heat (or other processes) 
for a sufficient time to cause the reduction of microorganisms of 
public health concern to levels that, under normal conditions of 
storage, are unlikely to cause disease. 

C. botulinum

 type E is 
a pathogenic microorganism that may be found in fish and fishery 
products. 
Botulism is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the 
ingestion of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during 
the growth of 

C. botulinum. C. botulinum

 type E can grow and 
produce toxin at temperatures as low as 3.3 
 C (38 
 F), and must, 
therefore, be eliminated from the hermetically sealed container 
during the pasteurization process. Pasteurized products that are 
stored, distributed, and displayed in the frozen state, and are 
so labeled, are not similarly at risk, and need not be subjected 
to the constraints of these control measures. 
For there to be assurance that the pasteurization step 
effectively eliminates the microorganisms of public health 
significance (e.g., 

C. botulinum

 type E), a minimum acceptable 
process should be scientifically established. This requires 
expert knowledge of thermal process calculations. Procedures 
used in establishing the minimum thermal process should be those 
that are generally recognized and accepted. Sometimes, thermal 
death time, heat penetration, and inoculated pack studies will be 
necessary to establish the minimum process. In other instances, 
existing literature is sufficient to provide the processor with a 
minimum process. 
In either case, characteristics of the process and/or the 
product will necessarily affect the ability of the cook step to 
effectively eliminate the microorganisms of public health 
significance. Such factors should be considered in the 
establishment of the process. Where control of those factors is 
necessary to consistently achieve that goal, the process 
authority should specify these to the processor. 
It is necessary that the pasteurizing equipment be designed 
and operated so that every unit of product receives the 
established minimum process. This will require that a competent 
process authority, who is thoroughly familiar with the dynamics 
of heat transfer in processing equipment, evaluate the design and 
operation of the type of equipment used by the processor. 
Sometimes temperature distribution studies will be necessary to 
establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances 
existing literature will be sufficient to establish the adequacy 
of the equipment. 


Critical Control Point: Pasteurization Control Measures 


1. Make sure that the pasteurization process that is being 
used was designed to ensure an appropriate reduction in the 
numbers of viable microorganisms of public health concern. The 
adequacy of the pasteurization process should be established by a 
process authority. The pasteurization process that is being used 
should meet any factors of the process or of the product that are 
identified by the process authority as critical to achieving 
pathogen destruction. At a minimum, these critical factors 
should include pasteurizing times and temperatures. 
2. Make sure that the pasteurization equipment being used 
is properly designed and operated to deliver the process 
established by the process authority. The engineering 
specifications of the equipment being used (e.g., pipe sizes, 
flow rates, loading pattern) should meet or exceed that of the 
equipment evaluated by a process authority. 
3. Deliver the pasteurization process in a way that there 
is no deviation from the minimum established pasteurization 
critical factors. 
4. Monitor the pasteurization temperature with a 
temperature recording device (i.e., temperature recorder). The 
temperature recorder should be installed where it can be easily 
read and the sensor for the device should be installed to ensure 
that it accurately measures the coldest temperature of the 
pasteurizing equipment. The temperature recorder must show a 
continuous record of the process. Computerized storage of 
temperature data may be used for a temperature recorder chart if 
the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to 
be equivalent to the use of a temperature recorder. 
5. Check the accuracy of each temperature recorder at the 
beginning and end of each production day and adjust it as 
necessary to agree as nearly as possible with a temperature 
indicating device (mercury-in-glass thermometer or equivalent 
device). The thermometer should be installed where it can be 
easily read and placed to ensure that it accurately measures the 
coldest temperature of the pasteurizing equipment. 
6. Calibrate the thermometer at the pasteurizing 
temperature against an accurate standard thermometer. This 
should be done when the thermometer is installed and at least 
once a year after that, or more frequently, if necessary, to 
ensure its accuracy. 
7. Monitor the length of the pasteurization cycle. 
8. Monitor other critical factors (e.g., initial 
temperature, container size, product formulation) at the start of 
each shift or when the product changes during a shift.

Example


The ABC Crab Co. produces pasteurized crabmeat. The 
pasteurization process being used has been established by 
the university extension service (a process authority). The 
process provided by the extension service includes limits on 
how to stack the canned product into the pasteurizer, the 
process temperature, and the length of time needed to 
achieve proper pasteurization. 
The pasteurization equipment being used by ABC Crab Co. is 
at least equivalent to that described by the information 
received from the extension service. It is equipped with 
both a mercury-in-glass thermometer and a recording 
thermometer. The recording thermometer is compared to the 
mercury-in-glass thermometer during each pasteurization 
cycle. It is adjusted as necessary to meet the critical 
limit. The mercury-in-glass thermometer is calibrated at an 
independent laboratory every 6 months. The temperature of 
each pasteurization cycle is controlled to meet the critical 
limits using the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the length 
of each cycle is controlled using a wall clock. The loading 
of the cans is checked before starting each batch. 


Frequency 


1. For making sure that the pasteurization process was 
properly established: before using a pasteurization process. 
2. For making sure that the pasteurizing equipment is 
properly designed: before using pasteurizing equipment. 
3. For properly delivering the process: each lot or batch. 
4. For monitoring the temperature: each lot or batch. 
5. For checking the accuracy of the temperature recorder: 
at the beginning and end of each production day. 
6. For calibrating the thermometer: at installation and at 
least annually after that. 
7. For monitoring the length of the pasteurizing cycle: 
each lot or batch. 
8. For monitoring other critical factors: as often as 
necessary to achieve control. 


Critical Limits 


Zero tolerance for product produced with a deviation from 
the minimum established pasteurization process, including such 
critical factors as time, temperature, initial temperature, 
container size, and product formulation. 
The temperature-indicating device should agree within 1 
 C 
(

#

2 
 F) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) traceable thermometer. 
The temperature recording device should be adjusted to agree 
as nearly as possible, but never to be higher, than the 
temperature indicating device. 


Records 


A record that describes the results of a scientific 
evaluation, conducted by a process authority, of the adequacy of 
the pasteurizing process. Such document may consist of, but is 
not limited to, a letter from a process authority, articles in 
scientific journals, or Federal, State, or local government 
regulations or advisories. 
A record that describes the results of a scientific 
evaluation, conducted by a process authority, which applies to 
the design and operation of the type of equipment used by the 
processor. 
A record for each lot or batch that shows the results of the 
pasteurization process. The records should include: the time of 
day that the pasteurization temperature is achieved; the time of 
day that the pasteurization cycle ends; the time of day that the 
product is placed in the water; and, as appropriate, the product 
size, belt speed (continuous pasteurizer), the temperature at the 
time that the processing starts, and any other factors of the 
process or of the product that are identified by the process 
authority as being critical to achieving pathogen reduction. 
Temperature recorder charts or computerized temperature data 
storage. A record of calibration for thermometers that specify 
the date, standard against which the thermometers were compared 
(NIST-traceable thermometer), procedure used, results, and person 
performing the test. 
A record of accuracy checks for the temperature recorder 
that specifies the time, date, temperatures shown by the 
thermometer and temperature recorder before adjustment, the 
corrective action taken, and person performing the accuracy 
check.

Records of process evaluation by the process authority, 
where deviations from critical limits occurred. 


Corrective Actions 


When there has been a failure to maintain appropriate 
temperature, time, or other critical factors of the process or of 
the product, within the critical limits, the affected product 
should be: 
 destroyed; 
 reprocessed to eliminate the hazard, keeping full 
records of the processing conditions; or, 
 segregated and held until an evaluation can be made 
to determine the effect of a deviation. The evaluation 
should be made by a process authority following 
recognized procedures. Unless the evaluation shows 
that the product has received adequate pasteurization, 
the product should be destroyed or reprocessed to 
eliminate the hazard. 
Indicating or recording thermometers that cannot be adjusted 
to within the critical limits should be repaired or replaced. A 
thermometer that has a divided fluid column should be immediately 
repaired or replaced. 
Any critical limit deviation should cause a timely 
assessment by management to: Learn whether the process or HACCP 
plan needs changing to reduce the risk of recurrence of the 
deviation, and take appropriate followup action.

1. General guidance for smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products


This section provides consolidated guidance on how to meet 
the requirements of subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, for the 
processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. This 
guidance involves processing procedures for the control of the 
microbiological hazards to which these products are particularly 
susceptible. The guidance does not apply to finnan haddie, 
smoked cod fillets, smoked scotch kippers, or other smoked fish 
that are cooked before being consumed, because these products 
will be heated to destroy any potential toxins or pathogens. The 
guidance also does not apply to smoked fishery products that are 
packaged in hermetically sealed containers, processed to destroy 
spores of nonproteolytic 

C. botulinum 

types B, E, and F, and 
stored and distributed refrigerated, in the same container. 
These products are covered by Appendix A relating to Cooked, 
Ready-to-Eat fishery products. In addition, the guidance does 
not cover environmental or other hazards that might occur before 
the processor takes possession of its product or raw materials. 
(Guidance on these hazards may be found in a separate guidance 
document for all fish and fishery products issued by FDA.) 


2. Definitions


a. 

Cold-process smoked or cold-process smoked-flavored fish

 
means the finished food prepared by subjecting forms of smoked 
fish and smoke-flavored fish to heat for a period of time that 
does not coagulate the protein. 
b. 

Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoke-flavored fish

 
means the finished food prepared by subjecting forms of smoked 
fish and smoke-flavored fish to sufficient heat for a sufficient 
period of time to coagulate protein throughout the fish. 
c. 

Liquid smoke

 means an aqueous solution of wood smoke 
which, when suitably diluted, may be used to impart a smoke 
flavor to fish products. 
d. 

Loin muscle

 means the longitudinal quarter of the great 
lateral muscle of the fish that is free from skin, scales, 
visible blood clots, bones, gills, and from the nonstriated part

the product by limiting microbial growth or detrimental chemical changes in the food.

f. 

Smoked-flavored fish

 means fish that is prepared by treating it with salt (sodium chloride) and then imparting to it the flavor of smoke by
other than the direct action of smoke, such as immersing it in a solution of liquid smoke. This paragraph does not alter
the labeling requirements under  101.22 of this chapter.

g. 

Smoked fish

 means fish that is prepared by treating it with salt (sodium chloride) and then subjecting it to the direct action of
smoke from burning wood, sawdust, or similar material.

h. 

Sodium nitrite content

 means the concentration in parts per million of sodium nitrite in the loin muscle of the finished product as determined
by the method of analysis for sodium nitrite in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical
Chemists,'' 15th ed. (1990).

i. 

Vacuum-packaged

 means the food-packaging technique in which the air in a package or container is removed before sealing.

j. 

Water-phase salt content

 means the percent salt (sodium chloride) in the finished product as determined by the method of analysis for water-phase
salt on the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 15th ed. (1990).
It is measured in the loin muscle of whole, dressed fish and in the thickest part of cuts of fish.



3. Critical Control Points



Hazards Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, will
typically identify and address the following critical control points:

a. Raw material thawing

b. Brining or dry salting

c. Drying

d. Smoking

e. Cooling after smoking

f. Post-smoke processing, if any

g. Final product cooling

h. Refrigerated storage

i. Distribution

In accordance with subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, processors shall identify in their HACCP plans how they will control
hazards at critical control points. The measures in sections 4 through 11 of this guidance are suitable for HACCP plans.



4. Thawing



Thawing should be carried out in as rapid a manner as possible, so that the internal temperature at the core of the fish
does not exceed 40 
 F (4.4 
 C).



5. Brining and smoking

a. Products covered by this guidance should be subjected to one of the following processes: 
(1) Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoke-flavored fish to be air packaged needs to be heated to a continuous internal
temperature of at least 145 
 F (63 
 C) throughout each fish for a minimum of 30 minutes, and brined to contain not less than 3.0 percent water-phase
salt in the finished product (except that smoked chub containing sodium nitrite as provided for in  172.177
of this chapter must be processed as described in that section); or 
(2) Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoked-flavored fish to be vacuum packaged, modified atmosphere packaged,
or controlled atmosphere packaged, needs to be heated to a continuous internal temperature of at least 145 
 F (63 
 C) throughout each fish for a minimum of 30 minutes. It also needs to be brined to contain not less than 3.5 percent
water-phase salt in the finished product. However, where sodium nitrite is present at not less than 100 parts per million
