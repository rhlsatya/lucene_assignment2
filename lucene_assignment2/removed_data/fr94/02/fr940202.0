Additional Grace Period Extension for Certain Existing Agency 
Standards of Conduct 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Government Ethics (OGE). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; technical amendment. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Government Ethics is granting an additional 
grandfathering grace period extension for up to one year for 
certain existing executive agency standards of conduct, dealing 
with financial interest prohibitions and prior approval for outside 
employment/activities, which have been temporarily preserved. This 
action is necessary because many agencies have not been able to 
develop, with OGE concurrence, supplemental regulations for such 
provisions during the first one-year grace period. This additional 
extension will help ensure that concerned agencies have adequate 
time to issue successor regulatory provisions to replace the 
restrictions noted. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) 
is granting under the executive branch standards of ethical conduct 
an additional extension of time for up to one year, until 
February 3, 1995, for certain agencies' existing conduct standards 
dealing with prohibited financial interests and prior approval for 
outside employment and activities. When OGE published its ethical 
conduct standards for executive branch employees in the 

Federal Register

 on August 7, 1992 (as now codified at 5 CFR part 2635), it 
provided, by means of notes following 5 CFR 2635.403(a) and 
2635.803, that although most existing individual agency standards 
of conduct would be superseded once the executive branch-wide 
standards took effect on February 3, 1993, existing agency 
standards dealing with the two types of restrictions noted above 
would be preserved for one year (until February 3, 1994) or until 
the agency concerned issued a supplemental regulation, whichever 
occurred first. See 57 FR 35006-35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 
and 52583. 


Various executive branch departments and agencies have 
expressed an interest in developing supplemental regulations 
involving one or both of these types of provisions. Through OGE's 
liaison efforts, the Office of the Federal Register has assigned 
new chapters and parts at the end of title 5 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations to accommodate these agencies' future supplemental 
standards regulations (on these two and other appropriate subject 
areas), as well as any supplemental agency regulations under OGE's 
executive branch-wide financial disclosure provisions at 5 CFR 
part 2634. However, although some of the agencies have, with OGE 
concurrence, issued interim final or final supplemental 
regulations, many have not yet had the time to finalize their 
planned supplemental regulations. 
The Office of Government Ethics has therefore determined to 
permit preservation of existing agency standards setting forth 
financial interest prohibitions and outside employment/activities 
prior approval requirements for up to one more year, until 
February 3, 1995 (or until issuance by each agency of its 
supplemental regulation, whichever comes first), while the 
concerned agencies continue to work to promulgate their new 
provisions in these two areas. The agencies subject to this 
additional grandfathering grace period extension are enumerated at 
new appendix A, which is being added to 5 CFR part 2635, in the 
order of the assignment of chapter numbers at the end of 5 CFR. 
Agencies not listed either have not expressed an interest in 
issuing supplemental agency regulations pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.105 
(or 5 CFR 2634.103) or have already issued final or interim final 
supplemental regulations. For agencies not listed in appendix A, 
the initial grace period for any existing standards of conduct 
financial interest prohibitions and prior approval for outside 
employment/activities expires on February 3, 1994. 


Administrative Procedure Act 


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d), as Director of the Office 
of Government Ethics, I find good cause exists for waiving the 
general notice of proposed rulemaking and 30-day delay in 
effectiveness as to this grace period extension. The notice and 
delayed effective date are being waived because this rulemaking 
concerns a matter of agency organization, practice and procedure 
and because it is in the public interest that those agencies 
concerned have adequate time to promulgate successor provisions to 
their existing standards of conduct regulations in these two areas, 
while preserving existing restrictions in the meantime. 


Executive Order 12866 


In promulgating this grace period extension technical 
amendment, the Office of Government Ethics has adhered to the 
regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulation 
set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory 
Planning and Review. This amendment has not been reviewed by the 
Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order, as it 
is not deemed ``significant'' thereunder.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 



As Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I certify 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this 
rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not 
apply because this rulemaking does not contain information 
collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of 
Management and Budget.

Netting Eligibility for Financial Institutions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board has adopted a rule to include certain entities under the definition of ``financial institution'' in section
402 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 so that they will be covered by the Act's netting
provisions. The Act authorizes the Board to expand the definition of ``financial institution'' to the extent consistent
with the purposes of enhancing efficiency and reducing systemic risk in the financial markets.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (Act) (Pub. L. 102-242, sections 401-407;
105 Stat. 2236, 2372-3; 12 U.S.C. 4401-4407) validates netting contracts among financial institutions.
Parties to a netting contract agree that they will pay or receive the net, rather than the gross, payment due under the
netting contract. The Act provides certainty that netting contracts will be enforced, even in the event of the insolvency
of one of the parties. The Act's netting provisions, effective December 19, 1991, are designed to promote efficiency
and reduce systemic risk within the banking system and financial markets.

The netting provisions apply to bilateral netting contracts between two financial institutions and multilateral
netting contracts among members of a clearing organization. Section 402(9) of the Act defines ``financial institution''
to include a depository institution, a securities broker or dealer, a futures commission merchant, and any other
institution as determined by the Board. In addition, the Act's definition of ``broker or dealer'' (section 402(1)(B))
includes any affiliate of a registered broker or dealer, to the extent consistent with the Act, as determined by the
Board.



Proposed Rule



In May 1993, the Board requested comment on a proposed regulation that would expand the application of the Act's netting
provisions to a broader range of financial market participants (58 FR 29149, May 19, 1993). The Board proposed that
persons meeting certain tests based on market activity would qualify as ``financial institutions'' under the Act.
The proposed tests were designed to capture institutions that are significant market participants whose coverage
could enhance market liquidity and whose failure without coverage could have systemic risk implications. The Board
chose the activity-based tests instead of tests based on an institution's status as a regulated entity, its affiliation
with a defined financial institution, or its class of charter. As these three latter tests likely would be both over-
and under-inclusive, the Board believed they were not as appropriate as an activity-based test.

The test proposed by the Board had both a qualitative and a quantitative aspect. First, to qualify as a financial institution
under the proposed rule, a person

1

 would have to participate actively in a financial market for its own account and hold itself out as a counterparty that
will engage in transactions both as a buyer and a seller in the financial market. Second, the person would have to meet
one of two quantitative thresholds: It must have either (1) had one or more financial contracts of a total gross dollar
value of $1 billion in notional principal amount outstanding on any day during the previous 15-month period with counterparties
that are not its affiliates, or (2) incurred total gross mark-to-market positions of $100 million (aggregated across
counterparties) in one or more financial contracts on any day during the previous 15-month period with counterparties
that are not its affiliates.





Final Rule



The final rule adopted by the Board retains the qualitative test, in a modified form, as well as the quantitative test.
Under the final rule, a person would qualify as a financial institution if it represents that it will engage in financial
contracts as a counterparty on both sides of one or more financial markets and meets one of the quantitative thresholds,
which are largely unchanged from the proposal.

The operation of the rule is prospective, i.e., the Act's netting provisions will apply only to those netting contracts
entered into after a person qualifies as a financial institution. The final rule clarifies that a person will continue
to be considered a financial institution for the purposes of any contract entered into during the period in which it
qualifies, even if the person subsequently fails to qualify during the life of the contract. In addition, the Board
has grandfathered those netting contracts in existence on the effective date of the final rule. If a person qualifies
as a financial institution on the effective date, that person will be considered a financial institution for the purposes
of any outstanding contract entered into prior to that date.

The Board also made various revisions to the proposed definitions. Those revisions are discussed in the comment summary
below.



Summary of Comments



The Board received 32 comment letters (from 30 commenters) on proposed Regulation EE. The commenters were distributed
as follows:

General Comments



Virtually all of the commenters supported the objectives of the Act's netting provisions and the Board's proposed
regulation. The commenters generally agreed that broadening the Act's definition of ``financial institution''
would enhance efficiency and reduce risk in the financial markets. Only two commenters expressed doubts as to whether
broader netting protection would decrease systemic risk. 
One commenter specifically supported expansion of the definition by rule rather than by case-by-case determinations.
Two commenters suggested that the Board should indicate in advance how it intends to use its discretion in case-by-case
determinations. The Board, however, has set forth in the regulation the standards it believes should apply for a person
to qualify as a financial institution in most circumstances. In case of unanticipated circumstances, the Board has
the flexibility to make case-by-case determinations based on standards different from those in the regulation.



Qualitative Test



Fifteen commenters raised concerns about the qualitative prong of the proposed rule's test. Eleven of these commenters
argued that the rule should cover major market participants that are end users, in addition to covering market intermediaries.
(Four commenters suggested that the Board eliminate the test altogether, and one commenter suggested that coverage
be extended to any entity that enters into a netting contract as defined by the Act.) The commenters stated that the
insolvency of a major end user would raise substantial settlement, liquidity, and systemic risks and that such risks
arise from the size and nature of an entity's positions, not from the character of its business. The commenters noted
that although end users may not be market-makers, their arbitrage strategies may cause them to take positions on both
sides of the market. The commenters observed that including end users would provide certainty of enforceability
for a broader range of netting contracts. They stated that this broader range of coverage would enhance market liquidity,
as dealers could do a larger volume of business with end users without raising credit limits, and would eliminate a
competitive disadvantage for end users. 

The Board has determined to retain the qualitative test, in a modified form. Although the Board recognizes that end
users (as well as their counterparties) might benefit by the netting provisions and the failure of certain end users
could create systemic risk, the Board believes it would be difficult to justify inclusion of many end users as ``financial
institutions.'' The Act defines ``financial institution'' to include traditional financial market intermediaries
such as banks, broker-dealers, and futures commission merchants. Expanding the definition to cover end users would
include many non-financial corporations and, potentially, even individuals. The Board believes it would be a stretch
of the statutory definition of ``financial institution'' to include institutions or individuals that are not market
intermediaries and are not in the financial services business. 

Eleven commenters offered suggestions on how to achieve certainty that a given entity qualifies as a financial institution.
The commenters argued that market participants would have no choice but to rely on the representations of their counterparties
in many cases. Many commenters suggested that market participants be allowed to rely in good faith on the written representation
of a counterparty, signed by an appropriate officer, stating that the tests were met. The commenters argued that this
``safe harbor'' would provide certainty in instances where a participant might otherwise refuse to deal with an institution
solely because it cannot verify the institution's qualifications. 

With regard to the qualitative test, five commenters noted that, as a practical matter, it would be difficult for counterparties
to verify that an institution participates ``actively'' in the financial markets and holds itself out as a market
intermediary. In addition, one commenter suggested that the rule should cover certain entities that do not enter
into transactions for their own account, such as collective investment funds and master trust arrangements that
act in a fiduciary capacity. One commenter noted that a statement from an entity that it meets the test could be considered
the equivalent of ``holding itself out'' as a market intermediary. Other commenters suggested eliminating the ``participates
actively'' clause. 

The Board agrees that an institution that represents that it is willing to engage in transactions on both sides of the
market is, in effect, holding itself out as a market intermediary. Accordingly, the Board has revised the language
of the qualitative test to provide that such a representation would suffice to meet the test. The Board has eliminated
that part of the proposed rule that would have required a financial institution to participate actively in a financial
market for its own account. The Board believes that the revised final rule provides counterparties with greater certainty
that an institution meets the qualitative test because counterparties can rely on the institution's representation.

Three commenters made drafting suggestions, such as (1) replacing the reference to ``buyer and seller,'' which is
appropriate in a securities market, with the more generic ``participates on both sides'' of the market, and (2) clarifying
that an institution may be active in one or more financial markets simultaneously. The Board has revised the rule to
incorporate both of these suggestions. Under  231.3(a) of the final rule, a person meets the qualitative test
if it ``represents that it will engage in financial contracts as a counterparty on both sides of one or more financial
markets.'' 



Quantitative Test



Fourteen commenters cited problems with the proposed quantitative test. Seven commenters noted that financial
market participants will have difficulty verifying whether their counterparties meet the volume thresholds because
publicly available financial statements typically do not present information in a format that would allow verification.
Five commenters stated that small-volume dealers would be placed at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in concentration
of trading at large dealers and barriers to entry. In addition, two commenters noted that the test would penalize business
wind-downs, as financial institutions would cease to be covered as their contracts expired. Two commenters argued
that counterparties could circumvent the test by engaging in reciprocal transactions to raise their outstanding
principal amounts artificially. 

As a solution to the problems cited above, eight commenters suggested that the Board eliminate the quantitative test.
These commenters stated that the qualitative test would be sufficient to guarantee coverage of parties with a material
presence in the financial markets, so a quantitative test is unnecessary. 

The purpose of the rule, however, is to further the Act's objectives of increasing efficiency and decreasing systemic
risk in the financial markets. The qualitative test targets institutions that are market intermediaries in order
to restrict coverage to those entities that can reasonably be included in the Act's definition of ``financial institution.''
The qualitative test alone does not necessarily focus on those institutions whose coverage would help achieve the
Act's objectives. The purpose of the quantitative test is to ensure that a covered institution engages in a level of
business such that its failure to meet its obligations could create systemic risk. 

The Board believes that most institutions that meet the qualitative test engage in a volume of transactions substantially
above the quantitative test thresholds. Although institutions entering the market may not be able to meet the quantitative
test right away, the test would aid in reducing systemic risk by helping to ensure the creditworthiness of new market
participants because they would have to achieve a certain level of market participation without the benefit of certainty
of the validity of netting provided by the rule. In addition, the quantitative test tends to encourage active market
participation by financial institutions by requiring them to meet certain volume thresholds within a set period
of time. The netting contracts of institutions that are winding down their businesses would continue to be covered
as long as the institution entered into the contracts while it qualified as a financial institution. (See discussion
of timing issues below and  231.3(b) of the final rule.) For these reasons, the Board has retained the proposed
quantitative test in  231.3(a) (1) and (2) of the final rule. 

The commenters also suggested changes in the event the quantitative test is not eliminated. Five commenters asked
that the volume thresholds be reduced from $1 billion in notional principle to $500 million and from $100 million in
gross mark-to-market positions to $50 million. As the Board does not believe these thresholds would be overly limiting,
it has not decreased the threshold levels. The Board may reexamine the thresholds if it finds that these levels prove
to be overly limiting. 

One commenter suggested that the Board establish one set of quantitative thresholds for dealers, but allow non-dealers
to be covered at higher thresholds. As discussed above, the Board believes that inclusion of end users, even at higher
volume thresholds, would be a stretch of the term ``financial institution.'' 

Another commenter suggested that the quantitative test measure average activity levels over a 24-month period to
discourage short-run attempts to increase activity. Although using average volumes could help discourage artificial
short-run increases in activity, it would also add more complexity to the determination of whether an institution
meets the quantitative test. Rather than focusing on one day in a 15-month period, averaging would require surveillance
of activity on a much more frequent basis. The final rule retains the proposed ``one-day'' test.

Several commenters suggested that the Board allow counterparties to rely on an external auditor's certificate or
that the Board redesign the test so that a party could verify its counterparty's qualifications by examining publicly
available information. The Board believes that institutions desiring to qualify as financial institutions under
the rule will have a strong incentive to present information in publicly available documents, such as financial reports,
showing that the institution meets the quantitative test. These reports could be verified by an outside auditor,
if the participants so desire. 
One commenter suggested that, for the purposes of the quantitative test, the Board should treat the aggregate risk
of an affiliated group as one entity, i.e. an institution would qualify as a financial institution if it meets the qualitative
test and it and/or its affiliates meet the quantitative test. If an institution fails to meet its obligations, however,
those obligations are not automatically assumed by its affiliates, even though in some cases a holding company, for
example, may make contributions to a troubled subsidiary. The Board believes that treating each institution separately
under the rule reflects more closely the risk that institution poses for its counterparties. 
Two commenters requested that the Board allow the quantitative test to be satisfied by financial contracts from several
financial markets, even though the institution may not satisfy the qualitative test for each one of those financial
markets. The rule would allow aggregation of financial contracts across markets for purposes of the quantitative
test, but would not require an institution to meet the qualitative test for each type of its financial contracts. For
example, an institution might meet the qualitative test by representing that it will engage in foreign exchange contracts
on both sides of the market and meet the quantitative test with both its foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.
The institution would nevertheless qualify as a financial institution, and all of its netting contracts would be
subject to the Act's protection. 
Finally, in  231.3(a)(2), the Board has changed the word ``incurred'' to ``had'' to clarify that the contracts
that yield mark-to-market positions of $100 million need not be entered into on a single day. Rather, the $100 million
refers to positions in outstanding contracts on a single day. 



Charter Test 



Six commenters suggested that the Board supplement the market activity tests with charter tests. The commenters
argued that charter tests are consistent with the approach taken in the Act and are competitively neutral for each
charter type. The commenters did not agree with the Board's statement that charter tests would foster inaccurate
presumptions about the riskiness of covered institutions. Rather, they believed that charter tests would promote
certainty without harmful results. The commenters requested coverage for a variety of charter types, including
bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, insurance companies, foreign banks (rather than solely their U.S.
branches and agencies), affiliates of registered broker-dealers, trust companies, Federal Reserve Banks, Federal
Home Loan Banks, and certain government-sponsored entities. 
The Board has determined not to expand the rule's coverage through charter tests. Charter tests would include many
end user institutions that are not market intermediaries, which the Board believes would stretch beyond the meaning
of ``financial institution.'' A charter test would also cover many institutions whose business volumes do not give
rise to systemic risk considerations. Although Congress used charter tests in the Act, the Board does not believe
that charter tests are necessarily the most appropriate means to expand Congress' definition. 
There may be certain end user institutions that reasonably can be described as financial institutions even though
they are not market intermediaries. The Board has the ability to make case-by-case determinations in these instances
and has done so. For example, in 1992, the Board made individual determinations in the cases of three CHIPS members.
Similarly, there may be certain government-sponsored entities or international organizations that do not meet
the requirements of the rule yet could reasonably be considered financial institutions due to their roles in the financial
markets. The Board would consider making individual determinations in such cases. 



Definitions 



The commenters also made various technical suggestions concerning the definitions. One commenter suggested that,
in the definition of ``affiliate,'' the Board replace the word ``dealer'' with ``person.'' The Board has revised
the definition in  231.2(b) accordingly. 
Two commenters requested that the Board revise the definition of ``gross mark-to-market positions'' to replace
the word ``price'' with ``value'' to clarify that market participants may use their normal market valuation methods
rather than the method used to price each transaction at its inception. Section 231.2(e) of the final rule reflects
this revision.

<TEXT>
 

Six commenters requested that the definition of ``person'' explicitly include an entity organized outside the U.S.,
thereby assuring that foreign banks and other foreign market participants could qualify as financial institutions.
Another commenter asked that the definition explicitly include trusts and that ``similar entity'' be changed to
the more general ``other entity.'' The Board intends that ``person'' be defined broadly to include all entities,
foreign and domestic, and has revised the definition in  231.2(f) to incorporate both of these comments. 
One commenter suggested that the Board include a comprehensive description of the financial institutions defined
by the Act as well as those defined by the regulation. However, to keep the rule as simple as possible, the Board has not
included the Act's definitions. Section 231.1(b) of the rule specifically states that the rule does not affect the
status of those financial institutions defined by the Act. 
One commenter suggested that the Act's definition of netting contract also be used in the regulation, rather than
the proposed ``financial contract'' definition, which is based on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act's (FDIA's)
definition of qualified financial contract. The commenter believed that using a common definition would reduce
confusion and avoid litigation. The final rule retains the concept of a financial contract based on the FDIA. The concept
of a financial contract narrows the focus of the rule to participants in the financial markets and is relevant only
to the determination of whether a particular institution qualifies as a financial institution under the rule. Once
an institution qualifies, the Act's netting provisions would apply to all of that institution's netting contracts,
as defined by the Act. 
The Board has expanded upon the FDIA to include spot forward contracts (contracts with maturities of two days or less)
as financial contracts for purposes of the qualitative and quantitative tests. Arguably, the FDIA definition of
swap agreement already includes spot forward contracts, however, for purposes of clarity, the Board has included
spot contracts expressly in the forward contract definition. 



Timing Issues 


Many commenters raised timing-related issues regarding the rule's coverage. Eight commenters requested that the
Board clarify that the Act's netting provisions will apply for the life of a contract as long as the parties qualify
as financial institutions at the time they enter into the contract. The Board has revised the rule to clarify that a
person will continue to be considered a financial institution for the purposes of any contract entered into during
the period it qualifies, even if the person subsequently fails to qualify. (See  231.3(b).) 
Four commenters suggested that the Board clarify that an institution's status as a financial institution will be
determined at the time it enters into a netting contract because that is when the counterparty will evaluate the institution's
creditworthiness. On the other hand, two commenters suggested that the netting provisions should be applied retroactively
to an institution's existing contracts once it qualifies as a financial institution. One commenter requested clarification
as to whether existing contracts will be grandfathered when the rule takes effect. Under the final rule, the Act's
netting provisions will apply only to those netting contracts entered into after a person qualifies as a financial
institution. However, the Board has revised the rule to grandfather those contracts in existence on the effective
date of the final rule for entities qualifying under the rule at that time. (See  231.3(c).)

One commenter requested that the Board define the 15-month rolling period in the quantitative test with reference
to the time parties enter into a master agreement, not the time of the first transaction under that agreement. In the
absence of a master agreement, the commenter suggested that the period be measured with reference to a particular
netting transaction. In practice, to determine whether a party meets the quantitative test, the 15-month period
will date back from the day a party enters into a netting contract, whether or not that netting contract is a master agreement.
Thus, on a particular day (``Day X''), a party meets the quantitative test if its financial contracts, as defined in
the rule, met one of the rule's threshold levels on any day during the previous 15 months. Assuming the party qualifies
as a financial institution and enters into a netting contract, as defined in the Act, on Day X,  231.3(b) of the
rule provides that the netting contract will be covered by the Act's provisions regardless of whether the party ceases
to qualify as a financial institution on a subsequent day. If the netting contract that the party enters into on Day
X is a master agreement, e.g., an agreement to net specified types of underlying transactions that the counterparties
may enter into in the future,  231.3(b) would provide that netting under that master agreement would continue
to be protected under the Act even though the party enters into individual underlying transactions after it ceases
to qualify as a financial institution. The Act's provisions would not extend to netting under any new master agreement
entered into after the party ceases to qualify as a financial institution. 




Board List. 



Two commenters requested that the Board keep a list of entities that have declared themselves to be financial institutions.
The Board believes that the commenters' concerns about lack of certainty are largely addressed by allowing counterparties
to rely on an institution's representation that it will act as a market intermediary and creating an incentive for
institutions to publish volume threshold information to establish that they meet the quantitative test. Thus, the
Board does not believe an ``official'' list is necessary. 



Automatic Stays. 



Section 405 of the Act provides that no injunction or similar order issued by a court or agency will interfere with the
application of netting. One commenter believed that section 405 could be interpreted so as 

not

 to override provisions for automatic stays in bankruptcy under federal or state law. The commenter asked that the
Board indicate its view on this matter. Although the Board cannot authoritatively interpret the provisions of the
Act, the Board believes the intent of the Act is to override the automatic statutory bankruptcy stays for valid netting
contracts. Sections 403 and 404 of the Act explicitly provide that netting is effective ``notwithstanding any other
provision of law.'' The Board believes that section 405 was included to clarify that the netting provisions override
court or agency actions in addition to overriding statutory law. 



CFTC Comment. 



The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) noted that it can exempt certain contracts between ``appropriate
persons'' from the Commodity Exchange Act's (CEA's) exchange-trading requirement and has done so for certain swaps,
hybrid instruments, and energy contracts. The CFTC may also exempt appropriate multilateral netting arrangements,
in which case the arrangement may not meet the Act's definition of clearing organization, which refers to an organization
that ``performs clearing functions for a contract market designated pursuant to the CEA.'' The CFTC stated that it
would like to work with the Board to ensure that a clearing organization exempted by the CFTC would be covered by the
Act's netting provisions. The Board is willing to work with the CFTC in this area.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


Two of the three requirements of a final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604), (1) a succinct statement
of the need for and the objectives of the rule and (2) a summary of the issues raised by the public comments, the agency's
assessment of the issues, and a statement of the changes made in the final rule in response to the comments, are discussed
above. The third requirement of a final regulatory flexibility analysis is a description of significant alternatives
to the rule that would minimize the rule's economic impact on small entities and reasons why the alternatives were
rejected. 
The rule, however, should not have an economic impact on small entities. The rule will apply only to entities with financial
contracts of $1 billion in gross notional principal amount or gross mark-to-market positions of $100 million over
a period of 15 months. Entities with a smaller level of market activity would not be covered by the Board's expanded
definition of ``financial institution.'' Many small market participants are included in the Act's definition of
``financial institution'' and thus are already covered by the netting provisions. The Board limited its expansion
of the Act's definition to entities with a relatively large volume of activity because the lack of netting coverage
for small entities is unlikely to affect overall market efficiency or systemic risk. 


List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 231 


Banks, banking, Financial institutions, Netting. 



For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Board adds a new part 231 to Title 12, Chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations
to read as follows: 


PART 231_NETTING ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REGULATION EE

(12 U.S.C. 4402(1)(B) and 4402(9)). 
(b) 

Purpose and scope. 

The purpose of the Act and this part is to enhance efficiency and reduce systemic risk in the financial markets. This

Regulatory Capital: Intangible Assets 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its risk-based capital treatment of intangible assets held by
savings associations. These amendments implement section 475 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which requires the OTS and each of the other federal banking regulators to determine the amount
of purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) that insured depository institutions may include in capital. Section
475 also requires PMSRs to be included in capital at 90 percent of market value, calculated at least quarterly. This
rule defines ``qualifying intangible assets'' as PMSRs and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs). Such assets
may be included in the aggregate in core capital calculations up to 50 percent of core capital, provided that PCCRs
may not exceed a sublimit of 25 percent of core capital. Savings associations may include the same dollar amount of
PMSRs in tangible capital that they include in core capital. These assets must be valued at the lower of 90 percent of
fair market value (in accordance with section 475 of FDICIA) or 100 percent of remaining unamortized book value computed
in accordance with instructions to the Thrift Financial Report. PMSRs and PCCRs in excess of applicable limits, as
well as core deposit intangibles (CDIs) and other types of nonqualifying intangibles, must be deducted from both
assets and capital in calculating core and tangible capital.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background and Description of Proposal 


In April 1992, the OTS proposed to amend its capital treatment of intangible assets. 57 FR 12761 (April 13, 1992). The
public comment period closed on May 13, 1992. The proposal was based on a tentative agreement on the treatment of intangible
assets reached by the OTS, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively with the OTS referred
to as the ``federal banking agencies'' or ``agencies''). 

Previously, all of the agencies allowed PMSRs to count towards core (Tier 1) capital calculations, with qualitative
and quantitative limits that varied among the agencies. Each agency had determined that PMSRs generally met criteria
comparable to those set forth in section 567.5(a)(2)(ii) of the OTS capital regulation, which provides that: (1)
The intangible asset must be able to be separated and sold apart from the savings association or from the bulk of the
association's assets; (2) the market value of the intangible asset must be established on an annual basis through
an identifiable stream of cash flows, and there must be a high degree of certainty that the asset will hold this market
value notwithstanding the future prospects of the savings association; and (3) the savings association must demonstrate
and document that a market exists that will provide liquidity for the intangible asset. 
The agencies differed on the extent to which other intangibles met this three-part test and treated such assets differently
in calculating capital. The OTS policy, which is being modified with the adoption of this rule, was that other identifiable
intangible assets, specifically CDIs, could satisfy the three-part test. The OTS did not require the deduction of
such other qualifying intangible assets from capital, but limited them to 25 percent of core capital. 
All the agencies limited the amount of qualifying intangibles that institutions could include in capital.

1

 The FDIC and the OTS also imposed certain PMSR valuation requirements and reduced the amount of PMSRs reported on the
balance sheet to the lesser of: (1) 90 percent of fair market value; (2) 90 percent of original purchase price; or (3)
100 percent of remaining unamortized book value.

<TEXT>
 

The OTS proposed the following treatment for identifiable intangible assets for purposes of the tangible, core,
and risk-based capital requirements: 
1. PMSRs and PCCRs would be considered qualifying intangible assets.

2

 As such, they would not be deducted from capital provided that, in the aggregate, they did not exceed 50 percent of core
capital and provided that PCCRs did not exceed a sublimit of 25 percent of core capital. Excess PMSRs and PCCRs would
be deducted in determining core capital. 




To illustrate, assume that a savings association has total core capital of $1,000,000. The association also has qualifying
PCCRs of $300,000 and qualifying PMSRs of $200,000. For capital computation purposes, the association could include
$250,000 of its PCCRs (25 percent of $1,000,000) and all $200,000 of its PMSRs because the total of PMSRs and allowable
PCCRs does not exceed 50 percent of core capital. 
2. Savings associations could include the same amount of PMSRs in tangible capital that they include in core capital.
Amounts excluded from core capital must also be excluded from tangible capital. 
3. PCCRs would be includable only in core capital, not tangible capital. 
4. The limits on PMSRs and PCCRs would be based on a percentage of core capital before excess holdings of these assets
are deducted, but after nonqualifying identifiable intangible assets (

i.e., 

nongrandfathered CDIs) are deducted.

3

 




5. Savings associations would be required to determine the fair market value and to review the book value of their PMSRs
and PCCRs at least quarterly. Such assets could not be carried at a book value that exceeds the discounted value of their
future net income. 
6. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, the amount of PMSRs and PCCRs reported as balance sheet assets
would be reduced to the lesser of 90 percent of their fair market value, 90 percent of their original purchase price,
or 100 percent of their remaining unamortized book value. 
7. Nongrandfathered CDIs and all identifiable intangible assets other than qualifying intangible assets would
be deducted from capital in calculating core capital. 



II. Summary of Comments and OTS Response 


The OTS received twenty-seven comment letters on the proposed rule. Commenters included eighteen savings associations,
six trade associations, a group of fifteen mortgage servicers, one commercial bank, and one law firm. No comments
addressed PCCRs. Comments focused primarily on two areas: the treatment of PMSRs and the treatment of CDIs. Issues
raised by commenters are addressed below. 



A. PMSR Treatment and Valuation 


No commenters objected to the inclusion of PMSRs as qualifying intangible assets. 


1. Fifty Percent Capital Limitation

Some commenters objected to limiting qualifying intangibles to 50 percent of core capital. One suggested that less
disruptive ways to achieve the same goals exist such as substituting a case-by-case supervisory approach to determine
capital adequacy of depository institutions holding PMSRs. 


The OTS is adopting a 50 percent of core capital limit on PMSRs to be consistent with the rules issued by the other federal
banking agencies.

4

 OTS capital rules are in the main patterned after those of the other banking agencies, especially the OCC. The statute,
as well as sensible practice, dictates uniformity to the greatest extent feasible. 





2. Annual Independent Market Valuation of PMSRs 


Many commenters objected to an annual independent valuation of PMSRs as excessively costly and unnecessarily burdensome
when combined with other limitations in the proposal, and suggested that the requirement be eliminated. Many commenters
noted that banks regulated by the OCC and the FRB are not subject to this requirement. Some commenters recommended
establishing a minimum threshold below which OTS would not require independent annual valuation of PMSRs. Other
commenters suggested that an independent valuation be required only where an institution cannot produce a satisfactory
internal valuation. 

In response to these comments, the OTS is modifying  567.12(d) to remove the independent valuation requirement.
The OTS, however, will reserve the right to require certain savings associations to obtain independent valuations,
either on a case-by-case basis or according to general guidance issued in conjunction with the adoption of this rule.




3. PMSR Valuation Basis 



Some commenters proposed that an association should be permitted to calculate the discounted book value of qualifying
intangibles on an aggregate basis for the institution's total purchased servicing portfolio rather than on a pool-by-pool
basis. The OTS and the other agencies will permit an institution to use either method. The accounting practices otherwise
required by this rule protect adequately against potential abusive practices. 



4. Discounting Approach 


Some commenters stated that limiting PMSRs and PCCRs to 90 percent of fair market value was arbitrary and that no other
assets are subject to such treatment. Two commenters argued that a constant discount rate should be applied to book
value, but not market value. One commenter suggested using a case-by-case approach based on criteria such as efficiency,
effectiveness, and profitability. 
Section 475 of FDICIA requires PMSRs included in capital to be valued at no more than 90 percent of fair market value
computed at least quarterly. The agencies have chosen to apply the same limit to PCCRs for consistency. The OTS and
the other agencies never intended to require institutions to use a constant discount rate in computing market value.
This rule, however, retains the proposed rule's requirement that savings associations use a discounting approach
in calculating book value because the OTS believes that the nondiscounted approach can result in inflated carrying
values. The OTS has issued a Thrift Bulletin regarding the valuation of PMSRs.

5. Discount Rate 



Some commenters believed that the proposed requirement to limit the discount rate used in the quarterly PMSR valuation
to a rate that is no less than the discount rate used at the original acquisition of the assets contradicts the concept
of determining current market value. The limitation on discount rate would only be used in calculating book value.
The agencies believe that requiring a discounting approach that uses the discount rate embedded in the yield estimate
at original purchase is appropriate in calculating book value because it will deter any overvaluation of the book
value of PMSRs and is consistent with historical cost accounting. 
This final rule is consistent with the final rules of the other agencies. These rules retain the requirement to use
a discounting approach but transfer the specific guidance on the applicable discount rate and other valuation guidance
to their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports). 

The Thrift Financial Report will require PMSRs and PCCRs to be carried at a book value that does not exceed the discounted
amount of estimated future net cash flows. Management of an association must review the carrying value at least quarterly,
adequately document this review, and adjust the book value as necessary. If unanticipated prepayments, defaults,
account attrition, or other events reduce the amount of expected future net cash flows, a write down of the book value
of the PMSRs or PCCRs must be made to the extent that the discounted amount of future net cash flows is less than the assets'
carrying amounts. The discount rate used for this book value calculation may not be less than the original discount
rate inherent in the intangible asset at the time of its acquisition based upon the estimated net cash flows and the
price paid at the time of purchase. 


6. Valuation Limitation of 90 Percent of Original Cost 


Some commenters recommended that the agencies drop the proposed requirement that qualifying intangibles be carried
at no more than 90 percent of their original purchase price. They argued that this limitation provides no additional
protection to the insurance fund from economic risk and unfairly penalizes institutions with recently acquired
PMSRs or PCCRs. The agencies agree and believe that the other valuation limitations should ensure that qualifying
intangibles are conservatively valued for capital purposes. Accordingly, the 90 percent of original cost limitation
has been removed.

7. OTS Transition Provision for PMSRs 


The proposed transition provision would permit grandfathered PMSRs that ``run-off'' to be replaced without loss
of grandfathered status if certain criteria are satisfied. Many commenters agreed with the proposed transition
provisions for PMSRs. Several commenters recommended that the grandfathering provisions become effective as of
January 28, 1991 (the effective date of the FDIC's PMSR rule, 12 CFR 325.5) rather than February 9, 1990 (the date of
publication of the FDIC PMSR proposal for that rule) or on the effective date of this regulation. One commenter suggested
that the OTS consider allowing large servicers to replace PMSR run-offs to minimize economic loss to institutions
from depletion of assets. 

The final rule retains the February 9, 1990, grandfathering date. This grandfathering date was used in the FDIC's
PMSR rule, which was applicable to both savings associations and state nonmember banks until the enactment of section
475 in FDICIA. The OTS believes that no distinction between large and small servicers is warranted. The OTS has, however,
retained the discretion to extend, on a case-by-case basis, grandfathered treatment to all or some of an association's
newly acquired PMSRs if purchased to replace grandfathered PMSRs that have prepaid or otherwise run off. This approach
is designed to mitigate harm to associations from precipitous drops in the level of their PMSR portfolios. Because
mortgage servicing is a business that has relatively high fixed costs, its profitability is highly sensitive to achieving
and maintaining a certain volume of servicing. This transition treatment will only be available if the OTS determines
that: (1) The association is phasing down PMSRs as a percentage of capital at an acceptable rate, and (2) such treatment
would be consistent with the association's safe and sound operation. 


B. CDI Treatment and Grandfathering 


The OTS has previously allowed certain CDIs to be included in assets and capital provided that they are conservatively
valued and meet the three-part test articulated in section 567.5(a)(2)(ii). The OTS is concerned that excluding
all CDIs from capital might impose an artificial regulatory barrier to sound mergers and acquisitions. The proposed
uniform interagency proposal specifically excluded CDIs from qualifying intangible assets. 
Eleven commenters objected to the proposed treatment of CDIs and argued that CDIs should be treated as qualifying
intangible assets. One commenter urged the OTS to apply the three-part test to CDIs, with periodic reviews of CDIs
and continuous evaluations of CDI amortization. Another commenter proposed that the set of qualifying intangibles
be expanded to include CDIs, and that CDIs and PCCRs be subjected to the sublimit of 25 percent of core capital, and that
CDIs should only be deducted from capital for undercapitalized institutions. One commenter questioned the inclusion
of the three-part test in the regulation if PMSRs and PCCRs are the only acceptable qualifying intangibles. Another
commenter recommended that CDIs existing at the time the proposal is finalized be grandfathered as a component of
core capital. 
To minimize confusion, all the banking agencies agreed to delete the three-part test from their capital regulations
and guidelines. Although the three criteria are no longer part of the agencies' regulations and guidelines, they
may be used in the future to determine whether other intangibles should be added to the definition of qualifying intangible
assets. 
In the interest of interagency uniformity, the OTS is changing its current policy on CDIs and will henceforth no longer
treat CDIs as qualifying intangibles. The OTS is also rescinding Thrift Bulletin No. 38-1 regarding CDIs. 
The OTS, however, will grandfather CDIs that result from prior transactions or that will arise from transactions
that are under firm contract as of the effective date of this rule. Nongrandfathered CDIs shall be deducted from assets
and capital in computing core capital. No CDIs or PCCRs are included in tangible capital. 

Some commenters suggested that CDIs should not be subject to the requirements for annual and quarterly market valuations,
quarterly determinations of book value, and value limitations set forth in 12 CFR 567.12(d), (e), and (f), respectively.
They also said that these assets should be recorded in accordance with GAAP. In response to those comments, the OTS
is modifying its treatment of grandfathered CDIs to require associations to apply GAAP. The OTS, however, will require
associations to use credible and supportable assumptions in applying GAAP to CDIs not deducted from assets and capital.
Valuing CDIs depends upon assumptions regarding interest rates for alternative funding, costs other than interest
associated with the core deposit base, the decay rate for an acquired customer base, and a discount rate. The amortization
rate should be adjusted each year for changes in experienced and expected decay in the acquired customer base. Typically,
the decay rate in the customer base is greater in the early years. The OTS may restrict an association's inclusion of
grandfathered CDIs in capital if the OTS determines that the association is not using prudent valuation assumptions.

III. Description of Final Rule 


The final rule makes some significant changes from the proposal, but follows the same general framework set forth
in the proposal and the previous FDIC rule. PMSRs and PCCRs will be considered qualifying intangible assets and included
in the aggregate in core capital up to 50 percent of core capital, provided that PCCRs may not exceed 25 percent of core
capital. Associations may include the same amount of PMSRs in tangible capital that they include in core capital.
The valuation requirements of this rule apply to PMSRs and PCCRs to be included in assets and not deducted from capital.

The major differences between the final rule and the proposal, then, are: (1) The deletion from section 567.5(a)(2)(ii)
of the three criteria used to determine whether an intangible asset qualifies for inclusion in core capital; (2) the
reservation by the OTS of the authority to require an independent market valuation of PMSRs and PCCRs on a case-by-case
basis or by the issuance of separate policy guidance; (3) the transfer of the requirements imposed in conducting the
book value test from this rule to the Thrift Financial Report; and (4) the elimination of the 90 percent of original
cost limitation for purposes of calculating capital. 


IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), it is hereby certified that this
rule will not have a significant or disproportionate economic impact on a substantial number of small savings associations.
Furthermore, this rule will not impose any new recordkeeping or other requirements on any associations. It generally
will retain the current treatment of thrifts' PMSRs and will allow PCCRs to be counted in thrifts' core capital. Accordingly,
a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis is not required. 


V. Executive Order 12866 


The Director of the OTS has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive
Order 12866. 


List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 567 


Capital, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations.

(a) 

Scope.

 This section prescribes the maximum amount of qualifying intangible assets that savings associations may include
in calculating tangible and core capital.

(b) 

Definition. Qualifying intangible assets

 means purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships. Purchased mortgage servicing
rights may be included in (that is, not deducted from) tangible and core capital calculations and purchased credit
card relationships may be included in core capital calculations. These assets may be included in capital only to the
extent they meet the limitations and restrictions set forth in this section. Other identifiable intangible assets,
including core deposit intangibles not grandfathered pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, must be deducted
from assets and capital, except as provided by  567.5(a)(2)(ii) of this part.

(c) 

Market valuations.

 The OTS reserves the authority to require any savings association to perform an independent market valuation of qualifying
intangible assets on a case-by-case basis or through the issuance of policy guidance. An independent market valuation,
if required, shall be conducted in accordance with any policy guidance issued by the OTS. A required valuation shall
include adjustments for any significant changes in original valuation assumptions, including changes in prepayment
estimates or attrition rates. The valuation shall determine the current fair market value of the qualifying intangibles
by applying an appropriate market discount rate to the net cash flows expected to be generated from the intangibles.
This independent market valuation may be conducted by an independent valuation expert evaluating the reasonableness
of the internal calculations and assumptions used by the association in conducting its internal analysis. The association
shall calculate an estimated fair market value for the qualifying intangibles at least quarterly regardless of whether
an independent valuation expert is required to perform an independent market valuation.

(d) 

Value limitation.

 For purposes of calculating core capital under this part (but not for financial statement purposes), each qualifying
intangible asset must be valued at the 

lesser

 of:

(1) 90 percent of the fair market value of the intangible assets determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this
section; or

(2) 100 percent of the remaining unamortized book value of the intangible assets determined in accordance with the
instructions in the Thrift Financial Report.

(e) 

Core capital limitation

_(1) 

Aggregate limit.

 The maximum aggregate amount of qualifying intangible assets that may be included in core capital shall be limited
to the lesser of:

(i) 50 percent of the amount of core capital computed before the deduction of any disallowed qualifying intangible
assets; or

(ii) The amount of qualifying intangible assets determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) 

Sublimit for purchased credit card relationships. 

In addition to the aggregate limitation on qualifying intangible assets set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section,
a sublimit shall apply to purchased credit card relationships. The maximum allowable amount of purchased credit
card relationships shall be limited to the 

lesser

 of: 
(i) 25 percent of the amount of core capital, as computed before the deduction of any disallowed qualifying intangible
assets; or 
(ii) The amount of qualifying intangible assets determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. 
(f) 

Tangible capital limitation. 

The maximum amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights that may be included in tangible capital shall be the same
amount includable in core capital in accordance with the limitations set by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 
(g)

 Grandfathering.

 (1) Notwithstanding the core capital and tangible capital limitations set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this
section, any otherwise disallowed purchased mortgage servicing rights that were acquired on or before February
9, 1990, and any otherwise disallowed purchased mortgage servicing rights for which a contract to purchase the servicing
rights had been executed on or before February 9, 1990, may be grandfathered and recognized for regulatory capital
purposes under this part to the extent permitted by the OTS. Grandfathered purchased mortgage servicing rights must
be treated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the requirements of paragraphs (c) and
(d) of this section. Grandfathered purchased mortgage servicing rights will count toward the core capital and tangible
capital limitations described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. 
(2) (i) On a case-by-case basis, the OTS may extend grandfathered treatment prospectively to all or part of the purchased
mortgage servicing rights acquired by an association to replace its grandfathered purchased mortgage servicing
rights if OTS determines that: 
(A) The association is reducing, at an acceptable rate, its level of purchased mortgage servicing rights to the levels
permitted by this section; and 
(B) The granting of such grandfathered treatment is consistent with the safe and sound operation of the association.

(ii) The OTS may terminate or limit such grandfathered treatment at any time if it determines that either of the conditions
in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section is not being satisfied. 
(3) Core deposit intangibles resulting from transactions consummated or under firm contract on the effective date
of this rule may be grandfathered and recognized for capital purposes under this part, to the extent permitted by OTS,
provided that such core deposit intangibles are valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
supported by credible assumptions, and have their amortization adjusted at least annually to reflect decay rates
(past and projected) in the acquired customer base. 
(h) 

Exemption for certain subsidiaries.

_(1) 

Exemption standard.

 An association holding purchased mortgage servicing rights in separately capitalized, nonincludable subsidiaries
may submit an application for approval by the OTS for an exemption from the deductions and limitations set forth in
this section. The deductions and limitations will apply to such purchased mortgage servicing rights, however, if
the OTS determines that: 
(i) The thrift and subsidiary are not conducting activities on an arm's length basis; or 
(ii) The exemption is not consistent with the association's safe and sound operation. 
(2) 

Applicable requirements.

 If the OTS determines to grant or to permit the continuation of an exemption under paragraph (h)(1) of this section,
the association receiving the exemption must ensure the following: 

(i) The association's investments in, and extensions of credit to, the subsidiary are deducted from capital when
calculating capital under this part; 
(ii) Extensions of credit and other transactions with the subsidiary are conducted in compliance with the rules for
covered transactions with affiliates set forth in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as applied to thrifts;
and 
(iii) Any contracts entered into by the subsidiary include a written disclosure indicating that the subsidiary is
not a bank or savings association; the subsidiary is an organization separate and apart from any bank or savings association;
and the obligations of the subsidiary are not backed or guaranteed by any bank or savings association and are not insured
by the FDIC.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A310-200 and A310-300 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Airbus Industrie Model A310-200
and A310-300 series airplanes, that currently requires inspections and test to detect broken or missing vespel
bushes in the flap universal joint assemblies, and replacement of universal joint bushes, if necessary. This amendment
adds a terminating modification for the currently required inspections and tests. This amendment is prompted by
the development of a modification that will improve the integrity of the flap universal joints. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent rupture of the flap universal joints, subsequent partial loss of lift in one wing,
and reduced controllability of the airplane.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 91-16-05, Amendment
39-7095 (56 FR 37462, August 7, 1991), which is applicable to all Airbus Industrie Model A310-200 and A310-300
series airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52041). The action proposed to add a requirement to modify the flap universal joint assemblies.
Installation of this modification would terminate the currently required inspections and tests to detect broken
or missing vespel bushes in the flap universal joint assemblies.




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received.

Both commenters support the proposal.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD.

The inspections and tests currently required by AD 91-16-05 take approximately 5 work hours to accomplish,
at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact on U.S. operators of the actions
previously required by AD 91-16-05 is estimated to be $6,875, or $275 per airplane, per inspection and
testing cycle.

It will take approximately 47 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modification required by this new AD action,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on
these figures, the total additional cost impact associated with the modification requirements of this AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $89,625, or $3,585 per airplane.

The cost figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished the requirements
of this AD action. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Imposition of Accuracy-Related Penalty 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary regulations.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These amendments to the regulations under 26 CFR part 1 
provide guidance on the imposition of the accuracy-related 
penalty under Internal Revenue Code sections 6662 (e) and (h) and section 6664(c) for transactions between persons
described in Internal Revenue Code section 482 and net section 482 transfer price adjustments. This action is necessary
because of changes to the applicable tax laws made by the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



This regulation is being issued without prior notice and public procedure pursuant to the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For this reason, the collection of information contained in this regulation has been reviewed
and, pending receipt and evaluation of public comments, approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
control number 1545-1365. The estimated annual burden per recordkeeper varies from 5 hours to 15 hours, depending
on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 10 hours. 

These estimates are an approximation of the average time expected to be necessary for a collection of information.
They are based on such information as is available to the Internal Revenue Service. Individual recordkeepers may
require greater or less time, depending on their particular circumstances. 

For further information concerning this collection of information, and where to submit comments on this collection
of information, the accuracy of the estimated burden, and suggestions for reducing this burden, please refer to the
preamble in the cross-referencing notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Proposed Rules section of this
issue of the 

Federal Register

. 



Background 



On January 21, 1993, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 5263) that proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations under sections 6662 (e) and (h) and section 6664(c)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code), as amended. Those proposed regulations implemented section 11312 of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Public Law 101-508, 104 Stat. 1388. Comments responding to the
notice of proposed rulemaking were received and a public hearing was held on May 14, 1993. Section 13236 of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66, 107 Stat. 312) further amended sections 6662 (e) and (h) of
the Code. After consideration of all comments received and pursuant to the statutory changes, the IRS has withdrawn
the previous proposed regulations and adopts this Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Provisions 



The principal purpose of these regulations is to set forth rules implementing the imposition of accuracy-related
penalties in the context of section 482. The exceptions from the penalty imposed under section 6662(e) in the case
of certain net section 482 transfer pricing adjustments are a key component of these rules are. Reflecting the amendments
to the statute pursuant to section 13236 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the regulations provide
a two-part exception from the imposition of the penalty with respect to such adjustments, depending on whether the
taxpayer used a specified or unspecified method under the regulations under section 482. If the taxpayer used a specified
method, the taxpayer must have reasonably concluded, based on the available data and the potentially applicable
alternative specified methods, that its application of the selected method resulted in the most accurate measure
of an arm's length result. Thus, if the taxpayer reasonably concluded that a different specified method would result
in a more accurate measure of an arm's length result than the selected method, the taxpayer would not satisfy the requirements
of this exception. If the taxpayer used an unspecified method, the taxpayer generally must have reasonably concluded,
based on the available data, that none of the specified methods was likely to achieve an arm's length result and that
the method used was likely to achieve such a result.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, irrespective of the method selected, the taxpayer must have prepared documentation articulating the required
analysis at the time that the tax return was filed, and provide such documentation to the Internal Revenue Service
within 30 days of a request for such documentation. 



The Need for Transfer Pricing Analysis and Documentation 



The arm's length standard seeks to mirror the results obtained by unrelated parties in their business dealings. Unrelated
parties analyze the value of property or services prior to selling or buying such property or services in the open market.
However, transactions between related parties do not involve the transfer of goods outside of the related party group.
A transfer price will not affect the total profit ultimately realized by the group but may affect total tax liability.
To ensure that the transfer price a taxpayer reports on its income tax return is determined in a manner consistent with
the arm's length standard, section 6662(e) encourages a taxpayer engaged in related party transactions to prepare
a factual and economic analysis based on reasonably available related party and third party market data that substantiates
the price chosen, and to maintain appropriate documentation of that analysis. 

The experience of the IRS has been that the majority of taxpayers do not provide an explanation of how their intercompany
pricing was established. In many cases examiners' access to a corporation's transfer pricing information is delayed
or denied. Moreover, many taxpayers do not rely upon any form of comparables or other contemporaneous information
either in planning or in defending intercompany transactions. The taxpayer, not having attempted to structure the
transaction in accordance with the arm's length standard, seeks to defend its position on examination by finding
whatever uncontrolled transaction or transfer pricing method provides a result that most closely approximates
the result initially reported. The failure by taxpayers to analyze their intercompany pricing prior to audit increases
controversy between taxpayers and the IRS, as both seek to develop 

post hoc 

analyses of the arm's length character of the transactions. Thus, the failure to apply the arm's length standard in
setting prices for controlled transactions (and the lack of contemporaneous documentation explaining that application)
increases the time spent and expense incurred by both the taxpayer and the IRS in determining whether that result was
consistent with the arm's length standard. Accordingly, these regulations are designed to encourage taxpayers
to make a serious effort to comply with the arm's length standard, report an arm's length result on their income tax
return, document their transfer pricing analyses, and provide that documentation to the IRS upon request. 



Statutory Requirements 



Section 6662(a) imposes a penalty in the amount of 20 percent of any underpayment to which the section applies. Section
6662(b) lists the types of underpayments to which section 6662(a) applies. One such underpayment is an underpayment
attributable to any substantial valuation misstatement under chapter 1 of the Code. 

Section 6662(e) defines a substantial valuation misstatement. These temporary regulations under section 6662(e)
contain the rules for determining whether there is a substantial valuation misstatement attributable to section
482 allocations. A substantial valuation misstatement exists if (1) the transfer price for any property or services
(or for the use of property) claimed on a return is 200 percent or more (or 50 percent or less) of the amount determined
under section 482 to be the arm's length amount (the transactional penalty), or (2) the net section 482 adjustment
exceeds the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts (the net adjustment penalty). 

Section 6662(h) increases the amount of the penalty to 40 percent for both the transactional and the net adjustment
penalties in the case of a gross valuation misstatement. There is a gross valuation misstatement if (1) the price for
any property or services (or for the use of property) claimed on any return in connection with any transaction between
persons described in section 482 is 400 percent or more (or 25 percent or less) of the amount determined under section
482 to be the arm's length amount, or (2) the net section 482 adjustment exceeds the lesser of twenty million dollars
or twenty percent of gross receipts. 



Amounts Excluded From a Net Section 482 Adjustment 



An amount is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the requirements of  1.6662-6T(d)(2),
(3), or (4) are met with respect to that amount. If a taxpayer meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of these regulations
with respect to some, but not all of the allocations made under section 482, then for purposes of determining the net
section 482 adjustment, setoffs, as taken into account under  1.482-1T(e)(5), must be applied ratably
against all such allocations.

Specified Method Applied 



Paragraph (d)(2) provides that an adjustment will be excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment
if the taxpayer satisfies the specified method requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) and the documentation requirement
of paragraph (d)(2)(iii). A taxpayer will meet the specified method requirement if the taxpayer selects and applies
a method specified in the section 482 regulations in a reasonable manner. A method is a specified method if it is described
in the regulations under section 482. With respect to transfers of tangible property, these methods currently include
the comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost-plus method, and comparable profits method.
With respect to transfers of intangible property these methods currently include the comparable uncontrolled transactions
method and comparable profits method. A bona fide cost sharing arrangement under  1.482-2A(d)(4) is
considered a specified method. 

Unspecified methods are methods other than specified methods. The profit split method, under  1.482-6
of the proposed regulations and qualified cost sharing arrangements, under  1.482-2(g) of the proposed
regulations, will become specified methods if and when regulations describing those methods are finalized. A taxpayer
will ordinarily not be considered to have applied an unspecified method merely because it failed to make an adjustment
in the application of a specified method. However, the failure to make adjustments is relevant to the reasonableness
of the application of that method. The selection and application of a method are reasonable only if, given the available
data and the potentially available methods, the taxpayer reasonably concluded that the method (and its application
of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method
rule in  1.482-1T(b)(2)(iii). 

The specified method standard differs from the more likely than not be sustained on the merits standard set forth in
proposed regulations issued on January 21, 1993. This change reflects the amendments made by section 13236 of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66, 107 Stat. 312) to section 6662(e), under which a section
482 adjustment is to be excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer reasonably applied
one of the specified section 482 methods (and satisfied the documentation requirements described below). In selecting
the method to apply, a taxpayer should select the specified method that is most appropriate under the facts and circumstances.
Thus, the taxpayer must reasonably conclude that its application of the transfer pricing method chosen will provide
the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the facts and circumstances of the transaction under review.
The application of a specified method will not satisfy this standard if the taxpayer concluded, or should have concluded,
that a reasonable application of another specified method would provide a more accurate arm's length result than
the method chosen. For example, a taxpayer might not satisfy this standard if the taxpayer applied the comparable
profits method to determine its prices but the taxpayer had data relating to a comparable uncontrolled transaction
involving substantially similar conditions. Given the guidance set forth in the section 482 regulations and the
existence of closely comparable data, a conclusion that a different analysis would provide a more accurate measure
of an arm's length result, ordinarily would not be reasonable. 

A taxpayer's analysis of its transfer prices must include the most current data that is available at the time that the
taxpayer files its tax return. These regulations require that taxpayers perform a reasonably thorough search for
data. However, this data may not reflect transactions in the current taxable year. Accordingly, it may be necessary
for taxpayers to make compensating adjustments to reflect changes in the data between the time that prices were set
for the year and the time that the return is filed. 



Factors 



The regulations discuss several nonexclusive factors that are to be taken into account in determining whether the
taxpayer reasonably concluded that its application of the method selected would provide the most accurate measure
of an arm's length result. The first factor is that a taxpayer's experience and knowledge in transfer pricing will
be relevant in determining how thorough and precise the taxpayer's analysis must be. In assessing the experience
and knowledge of the taxpayer, the experience and knowledge of the controlled group is taken into account, rather
than the experience and knowledge of any member of the controlled group. Thus, the larger and more sophisticated a
controlled group of corporations, the more thorough and precise its analysis should be. 

The second factor is the extent to which sufficient accurate data is available to apply a method reasonably. A taxpayer
is obligated to engage in a reasonably thorough search for comparable transactions and other data necessary to apply
the methods under section 482. A factor to consider in determining whether a search for data is reasonably thorough
is the cost of searching for the data in relation to the dollar amount of the intercompany transaction in question.
For example, a taxpayer need not obtain data regarding a comparable uncontrolled transaction if the intercompany
transaction had a value of $50,000 and the search for and analysis of the data will cost $25,000. Alternatively, if
necessary to reasonably apply a specified method, it ordinarily would be reasonable to expect that a taxpayer would
incur a similar expense to search for and analyze data if the taxpayer is engaged in intercompany transactions with
a dollar amount of $250 million. If a taxpayer's analysis neglected data that it would have been expected to obtain
under the above criteria, then the analysis would not be considered reasonable. 

The third factor is the extent to which a taxpayer follows the relevant requirements set forth in regulations under
section 482. Furthermore, in applying the selected method, the extent to which the taxpayer makes all the adjustments
necessary to reasonably conclude that its application of the method chosen would provide the most accurate measure
of an arm's length result will be taken into account. 

The fourth factor is the extent to which the taxpayer relied on the advice of a qualified professional. The extent to
which reliance is appropriate will depend on the qualifications of the professional and the quality of the study or
other advice that is rendered, rather than the relationship that the professional has to the taxpayer.

Unspecified Method Applied 



Paragraph (d)(3) provides that an adjustment will be excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment
if the taxpayer satisfies the unspecified method requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) and the documentation requirement
of paragraph (d)(3)(iii). The unspecified method requirement is met if a method other than a specified method was
applied and the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) (B) or (C) are met, as appropriate. 

Paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) provides that if the transaction is of a type for which there are specified methods, then
a taxpayer will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if the taxpayer reasonably concludes
that, given the available data, none of the specified methods was likely to provide an accurate measure of an arm's
length result, and that it selected and applied an unspecified method in a way that would likely provide an accurate
measure of an arm's length result, given the available data. 

Paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) provides that if the transaction is of a type for which there are no specified methods, then
a taxpayer will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if it selected and applied an unspecified
method in a reasonable manner. A taxpayer's selection and application is reasonable if the taxpayer reasonably concludes
that the method (and its application of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under
the principles of the best method rule in  1.482-T(b)(2)(iii). 



Documentation Requirement 



An examiner cannot effectively examine a taxpayer's transfer pricing without adequate documentation setting forth
the basic transfer pricing analysis conducted by the taxpayer. Accordingly, the documentation requirement does
not provide a long, rigid list of documents that must be maintained; rather it focuses on the type of information necessary
to evaluate how the taxpayer determined its transfer prices. The documentation requirements are essentially the
same regardless of whether the taxpayer uses a specified method or an unspecified method. They diverge only in what
the documentation must establish rather than the type of information that must be maintained. A taxpayer that uses
a specified method must maintain sufficient documentation (that is in existence when the return is filed) to establish
that it met the specified method requirement. A taxpayer that uses an unspecified method must maintain sufficient
documentation (that is in existence when the return is filed) to establish that it met the unspecified method requirement.
Regardless of the method used by the taxpayer, it must provide that documentation to the IRS within 30 days of a request.


The temporary regulations set forth two classifications of documentation_principal and background documents.
Principal documents consist of the basic transfer pricing analysis conducted by the taxpayer. Background documents
are documents that typically support the principal documents. Only principal documents must be provided upon the
IRS's request for principal documents. However, both types of documentation must be produced within thirty days
of a request. 

A district director has discretion to extend the period for producing principal documents only if the taxpayer has
made a minor or inadvertent failure to provide the required documents, has otherwise made a good faith effort to comply,
and remedies the failure when it becomes known. For background documents, a district director has discretion to extend
the production period for a short period. 



Foreign-to-Foreign Transactions 



Finally, paragraph (d)(4) provides that adjustments that are attributable to a transaction between foreign corporations
are also excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment, unless the treatment of that transaction affects
the determination of U.S. source income or taxable income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business within the United States. 



Carryovers and Carrybacks 



The regulations contain a special rule concerning tax benefits, such as losses, deductions, or credits, that may
be carried to another taxable year. If a taxpayer's substantial or gross valuation misstatement gives rise to such
a tax benefit that is carried to another taxable year, then the penalty will be imposed on any resulting underpayment
of tax attributable to such a tax benefit in that other taxable year. In determining whether there is a substantial
or gross valuation misstatement for a taxable year, no amount carried from another taxable year shall be included.




Coordination Rules 



The coordination rules remain substantively unchanged from the proposed regulations issued on January 21, 1993.
These regulations provide rules for coordinating imposition of the transactional penalty and the net adjustment
penalty. 



Advance Pricing Agreements 



If a transfer pricing methodology is developed and applied pursuant to an Advance Pricing Agreement in any tax year,
that methodology may reasonably be relied upon in the current year if the relevant facts and circumstances have not
changed or if the methodology has been appropriately modified to reflect any changes in facts and circumstances.




Effective Date 



These regulations apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. For taxable years ending after November
5, 1990, but beginning prior to January 1, 1994, the Treasury Department considers the proposed regulations issued
on January 21, 1993, to be a reasonable interpretation of sections 6662 (e) and (h), except that no requirement of contemporaneous
documentation may be imposed for transactions prior to April 21, 1993. In any case, contemporaneous documentation
may be helpful in establishing that the taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive
Order 12866. Therefore, an initial Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. It has also been determined that section
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Thomas L. Ralph of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International),
Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Definitions

_(1) 

Substantial valuation misstatement. 

 There is a substantial valuation misstatement if_
(i) 

200 percent test. 

The value or adjusted basis of any property claimed on a return of tax imposed under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue
Code is 200 percent or more of the correct amount; or 
(ii) 

Tests related to section 482. 

There is a misstatement described in  1.6662-6T (b)(1) or (c)(1) (concerning substantial valuation
misstatements pertaining to transactions between related persons). 
(2) 

Gross valuation misstatement. 

There is a gross valuation misstatement if_
(i) 

400 percent test.

 The value or adjusted basis of any property claimed on a return of tax imposed under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue
Code is 400 percent or more of the correct amount; or 
(ii) 

Tests related to section 482. 

There is a misstatement described in  1.6662-6T (b)(2) or (c)(2) (concerning gross valuation misstatements
pertaining to transactions between related persons). 
(3) 

Property. 

For purposes of this section, the term property refers to both tangible and intangible property. Tangible property
includes property such as money, land, buildings, fixtures, and inventory. Intangible property includes property
such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, leaseholds, patents, contract rights, debts, choses in action, and any
other item of intangible property described in  1.482-4T(b). 
(f) through (i) [Reserved] 
(j) 

Transactions between persons described in section 482 and net section 482 transfer price adjustments. 

For rules relating to the penalty imposed with respect to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement arising from
a section 482 allocation, see  1.6662-6T.


Par. 4.

 Section 1.6662-6T is added to read as follows: 


 1.6662-6T Transactions between persons described in section 482 and net section 482 transfer
price adjustments. 


(a) 

In general

_(1) 

Purpose and scope.

 Pursuant to section 6662(e) a penalty is imposed on any underpayment attributable to a substantial valuation misstatement
pertaining to either a transaction between persons described in section 482 (the transactional penalty) or a net
section 482 transfer price adjustment (the net adjustment penalty). The penalty is equal to 20 percent of the underpayment
of tax attributable to that substantial valuation misstatement. Pursuant to section 6662(h) the penalty is increased
to 40 percent of the underpayment in the case of a gross valuation misstatement with respect to either penalty. Paragraph
(b) of this section provides specific rules related to the transactional penalty. Paragraph (c) of this section provides
specific rules related to the net adjustment penalty, and paragraph (d) of this section describes amounts that will
be excluded for purposes of calculating the net adjustment penalty. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth special
rules in the case of carrybacks and carryovers. Paragraph (f) of this section provides coordination rules between
penalties. Paragraph (g) of this section provides the effective date of this section. 
(2) 

Reported results. 

Whether an underpayment is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement must be determined from
the results of controlled transactions that are reported on an income tax return, regardless of whether the amount
reported differs from the transaction price initially reflected in the taxpayer's books and records. The results
of controlled transactions that are reported on an amended return will be used only if the amended return is filed before
the Internal Revenue Service has contacted the taxpayer regarding the corresponding original return. A written
statement furnished by a taxpayer subject to the Coordinated Examination Program will be considered an amended return
for purposes of this section if it satisfies either the requirements of a qualified amended return for purposes of
 1.6664-2(c)(3) or such requirements as the Commissioner may prescribe by revenue procedure. In the
case of a taxpayer that is a member of a consolidated group, the rules of this paragraph (a)(2) apply to the consolidated
income tax return of the group. 
(3) 

Identical terms used in section 482 regulations. 

For purposes of this section, the terms used in these regulations shall have the same meaning as identical terms used
in regulations under section 482.

(b) 

The transactional penalty

_(1) 

Substantial valuation 
misstatement. 

In the case of any transaction between related 
persons, there is a substantial valuation misstatement if the 
price for any property or services (or for the use of property) 
claimed on any return is 200 percent or more (or 50 percent or 
less) of the amount determined under section 482 to be the 
correct price. 
(2) 

Gross valuation misstatement. 

In the case of any 
transaction between related persons, there is a gross valuation 
misstatement if the price for any property or services (or for 
the use of property) claimed on any return is 400 percent or more 
(or 25 percent or less) of the amount determined under section 
482 to be the correct price. 
(3) 

Reasonable cause and good faith. 

Pursuant to section 
6664(c), the transactional penalty will not be imposed on any 
portion of an underpayment with respect to which the requirements 
of  1.6664-4 are met. A taxpayer that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section with respect to an allocation under 
section 482 will be treated as having established that there was 
reasonable cause and good faith with respect to that item for 
purposes of  1.6664-4. If a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement under the transactional penalty also constitutes (or 
is part of) a substantial or gross valuation misstatement under 
the net adjustment penalty, then the rules of section (d) (and 
not the rules of  1.6664-4) will be applied to determine whether 
the adjustment is excluded from calculation of the net section 
482 adjustment. 
(c) 

Net adjustment penalty

_(1) 

Net section 482 
adjustment. 

For purposes of this section, the term net section 
482 adjustment means the sum of all increases in the taxable 
income of a taxpayer for a taxable year resulting from 
allocations under section 482 (determined without regard to any 
amount carried to such taxable year from another taxable year) 
less any decreases in taxable income attributable to collateral 
adjustments as described in  1.482-1T(e). For purposes of this 
section, amounts that meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section will be excluded from the calculation of the net 
section 482 adjustment. Substantial and gross valuation 
misstatements that are subject to the transactional penalty under 
paragraphs (b) (1) or (2) are included in determining the amount 
of the net section 482 adjustment. See paragraph (f) of this 
section for coordination rules between penalties. 
(2) 

Substantial valuation misstatement. 

There is a 
substantial valuation misstatement if a net section 482 
adjustment is greater than the lesser of 5 million dollars or ten 
percent of gross receipts. 
(3) 

Gross valuation misstatement. 

There is a gross 
valuation misstatement if a net section 482 adjustment is greater 
than the lesser of 20 million dollars or twenty percent of gross 
receipts.

(4) 

Setoff allocation rule. 

If a taxpayer meets the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section with respect to 
some, but not all of the allocations made under section 482, then 
for purposes of determining the net section 482 adjustment, 
setoffs, as taken into account under  1.482-1T(e)(5), must be 
applied ratably against all such allocations. The following 
example illustrates the principle of this paragraph (c)(4).

 




Example. 

(i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the 
following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: 






(ii) The taxpayer meets the requirements of paragraph (d) 
with respect to adjustment number one, but not with respect to 
adjustment number two. The five million dollar setoff will be 
allocated ratably against the nine million dollar adjustment 
($9,000,000/$15,000,000  x  $5,000,000 = $3,000,000) and the six 
million dollar adjustment ($6,000,000/$15,000,000  x  $5,000,000 = 
$2,000,000). Accordingly, in determining the net section 482 
adjustment, the nine million dollar adjustment is reduced to six 
million dollars ($9,000,000 ^ $3,000,000) and the six million 
dollar adjustment is reduced to four million dollars 
($6,000,000 ^ $2,000,000). Therefore, the net section 482 
adjustment equals four million dollars. 



(5) 

Gross receipts. 

For purposes of this section, gross 
receipts must be computed pursuant to the rules contained in 
 1.448-1T(f)(2)(iv), as adjusted to reflect allocations under 
section 482. 
(6) 

Coordination with reasonable cause exception under 
section 6664(c). 

Pursuant to section 6662(e)(3)(D), a taxpayer 
will be treated as having reasonable cause under section 6664(c) 
for any portion of an underpayment attributable to a net section 
482 adjustment only if the taxpayer meets the requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this section with respect to that portion. 
(7) 

Examples. 

The principles of this paragraph (c) are 
illustrated by the following examples. 





Example 1.

 (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the 
following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: 






(ii) None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph 
(d) of this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($6.5 
million) is greater than five million dollars. Therefore, there 
is a substantial valuation misstatement. 


Example 2. 

(i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the 
following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: 




 

(ii) The taxpayer has gross receipts of sixty million 
dollars after taking into account all section 482 adjustments. 
None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of this 
section. The net section 482 adjustment ($4 million) is less 
than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross 
receipts ($60 million  x  10% = $6 million). Therefore, there is 
no substantial valuation misstatement. 


Example 3.

 (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the 
following section 482 adjustments to the income of an affiliated 
group that files a consolidated return for the taxable year:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




(ii) Members A, B, and C have gross receipts of 20 million dollars, 12 million dollars, and 11 million dollars, respectively.
Thus, the total gross receipts are 43 million dollars. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of
this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($4.5 million) is greater than the lesser of five million dollars or ten
percent of gross receipts ($43 million x 10%=$4.3 million). Therefore, there is a substantial valuation misstatement.




Example 4. 

(i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments to the income of an affiliated group
that files a consolidated return for the taxable year:


 




(ii) Members A, B, and C have gross receipts of 20 million dollars, 35 million dollars, and 40 million dollars, respectively.
Thus, the total gross receipts are 95 million dollars. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of
this section. The net section 482 adjustment (7 million dollars) is greater than the lesser of five million dollars
or ten percent of gross receipts ($95 million x 10%=$9.5 million). Therefore, there is a substantial valuation
misstatement. 


Example 5.

 (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments to the income of an affiliated group
that files a consolidated return for the taxable year:


 




(ii) Members A, B, and C have gross receipts of 10 million dollars, 35 million dollars, and 40 million dollars, respectively.
Thus, the total gross receipts are 85 million dollars. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of
this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($4.5 million) is less than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent
of gross receipts ($85 million x 10%=$8.5 million). Therefore, there is no substantial valuation misstatement
even though individual member A's adjustment ($2 million) is greater than ten percent of its individual gross receipts
($10 million x 10%=$1 million).





(d) 

Amounts excluded from net section 482 adjustments_

(1) 

In general.

 An amount is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the requirements of paragraph (d)(2),
(3), or (4) of this section are met with respect to that amount. 

(2) 

Application of a specified section 482 method

_(i) 

In general.

 An amount is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer establishes that both the
specified method and documentation requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) are met with respect to that amount. For
purposes of this paragraph (d), a method will be considered a specified method if it is described in the regulations
under section 482 and the method applies to transactions of the type under review. A bona fide cost sharing arrangement
is considered a specified method. See  1.482-2A(d)(4). An unspecified method is not considered a specified
method. See  1.482-3T(e) and  1.482-4T(d). 

(ii) 

Specified method requirement. 

The specified method requirement is met if the taxpayer selects and applies a specified method in a reasonable manner.
The taxpayer's selection and application of a specified method is reasonable only if, given the available data and
the applicable pricing methods, the taxpayer reasonably concluded that the method (and its application of that method)
provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in  1.482-1T(b)(2)(iii).
For examples illustrating the selection of a specified method consistent with this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), see  1.482-1T(b)(2)(iii)(C).
An application of a specified method provides the most accurate measure of an arm's length result if it provides a more
accurate measure of an arm's length result than any alternative specified method and any alternative application
of the method chosen. Thus, it is not necessary for a taxpayer to conclude that the selected specified method provides
a more accurate measure of an arm's length result than any unspecified method. Whether the taxpayer's conclusion
was reasonable must be determined from all the facts and circumstances. The factors relevant to this determination
include the following: 

(A) The experience and knowledge of the taxpayer, including all members of the taxpayer's controlled group. 

(B) The extent to which accurate data was available and the data was analyzed in a reasonable manner. A taxpayer must
engage in a reasonably thorough search for the data necessary to determine which method should be selected and how
it should be applied. Furthermore, a taxpayer must use the most current reliable data that is available before the
return is filed. In this regard, the expense of collecting data relative to the dollar amount of the transactions in
question is a factor that may be taken into account in determining the scope of a reasonably thorough search for data.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(C) The extent to which the taxpayer followed the relevant requirements set forth in regulations under section 482
with respect to the application of the method.

(D) The extent to which the taxpayer reasonably relied on the analysis of, or a study done by, a professional qualified
to conduct such an analysis or study, including an attorney, accountant, or economist. Whether the professional
is an employee of, or related to, the taxpayer is not determinative in evaluating the reliability of that analysis
or study, as long as the analysis or study is objective, thorough, and well reasoned. Such reliance is reasonable only
if the taxpayer disclosed to the professional all relevant information regarding the controlled transactions at
issue. A transfer pricing study or analysis that was reasonably relied upon in a prior year may reasonably be relied
upon in the current year if the relevant facts and circumstances have not changed or if the study or analysis has been
appropriately modified to reflect any change in facts and circumstances.

(iii) 

Documentation requirement

_(A) 

In general.

 The documentation requirement of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) is met if the taxpayer maintains sufficient documentation
to establish that the taxpayer reasonably concluded that, given the available data and the applicable pricing methods,
the method (and its application of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's-length result under
the principles of the best method rule in  1.482-1T(b)(2)(iii), and provides that documentation to the
Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of a request for it. That documentation must be in existence when the return
is filed. The district director may, in his discretion, excuse a minor or inadvertent failure to provide required
documents, but only if the taxpayer has made a good faith effort to comply, and the taxpayer promptly remedies the failure
when it becomes known. The required documentation is divided into two categories, principal and background documents,
as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section.

(B) 

Principal documents.

 The principal documents should accurately and completely describe the basic transfer pricing analysis conducted
by the taxpayer. The documentation must include the following_

(

1

) An overview of the taxpayer's business, including an analysis of the economic and legal factors that affect the pricing
of its property or services;

(

2

) A description of the taxpayer's organizational structure (including an organization chart) covering all related
parties engaged in transactions potentially relevant under section 482, including foreign affiliates whose transactions
directly or indirectly affect the pricing of property or services in the United States;

(

3

) Any documentation explicitly required by the regulations under section 482;

(

4

) A description of the specified method selected and an explanation of why that method was selected;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(

5

) A description of the unspecified methods that were considered and an explanation of why they were not selected;

(

6

) A description of the controlled transactions (including the terms of sale) and any internal data used to analyze
those transactions;

(

7

) A description of the comparables that were used, how comparability was evaluated, and what (if any) adjustments
were made;

(

8

) An explanation of the economic analysis and projections relied upon in developing the method; and

(

9

) A general index of the principal and background documents and a description of the recordkeeping system used for
cataloging and accessing those documents.

(C) 

Background documents.

 The assumptions, conclusions, and positions contained in principal documents ordinarily will be based on, and supported
by, additional background documents. Documents that support the principal documentation may include the documents
listed in  1.6038A-3(c) that are not otherwise described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
Every document listed in those regulations may not be relevant to pricing determinations under the taxpayer's specific
facts and circumstances and, therefore, each of those documents need not be maintained in all circumstances. Moreover,
other documents not listed in those regulations may be necessary to establish that the taxpayer's method was selected
and applied in the way that provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the
best method rule in  1.482-1T(b)(2)(iii). Background documents need not be provided to the Internal
Revenue Service in response to a request for principal documents. If the Internal Revenue Service subsequently requests
background documents, a taxpayer must provide that documentation to the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days
of the request. However, the district director may, in his discretion, extend the period for producing the background
documentation.

(3) 

Application of an unspecified method

_(i) 

In general.

 An adjustment is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer establishes that both
the unspecified method and documentation requirements of this paragraph (d)(3) are met with respect to that amount.

(ii) 

Unspecified method requirement

_(A) 

In general.

 If a method other than a specified method was applied, the unspecified method requirement is met if the requirements
of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) (B) or (C), as appropriate, are met.

(B) 

Specified method potentially applicable.

 If the transaction is of a type for which methods are specified in the regulations under section 482, then a taxpayer
will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if the taxpayer reasonably concludes that, given
the available data, none of the specified methods was likely to provide an accurate measure of an arm's length result,
and that it selected and applied an unspecified method in a way that would likely provide an accurate measure of an arm's
length result, given the available data. This conclusion must be based on all the facts and circumstances. The factors
relevant to this conclusion include those set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.

(C) 

No specified method applicable.

 If the transaction is of a type for which no methods are specified in the regulations under section 482, then a taxpayer
will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if it selected and applied an unspecified method
in a reasonable manner. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C), a taxpayer's selection and application is
reasonable if the taxpayer reasonably concludes that the method (and its application of that method) provided the
most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in  1.482-1T(b)(2)(iii).
This conclusion must be based on all the facts and circumstances. The factors relevant to this conclusion include
those set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.

(iii) 

Documentation requirement

_(A) 

In general.

 The documentation requirement of this paragraph (d)(3) is met if the taxpayer maintains sufficient documentation
to establish that the unspecified method requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section is met and provides
that documentation to the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of a request for it. That documentation must be in
existence when the return is filed. The district director may, in his discretion, excuse a minor or inadvertent failure
to provide required documents, but only if the taxpayer has made a good faith effort to comply, and the taxpayer promptly
remedies the failure when it becomes known.

(B) 

Principal and background documents.

 See paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section for rules regarding these two categories of required documentation.

(4) 

Certain foreign to foreign transactions.

 For purposes of calculating a net section 482 adjustment, any increase in taxable income resulting from an allocation
under section 482 that is attributable to any controlled transaction solely between foreign corporations will be
excluded unless the treatment of that transaction affects the determination of either corporation's income from
sources within the United States or taxable income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within
the United States.

(5) 

Special rule.

 If the regular tax (as defined in section 55(c)) imposed on the taxpayer is determined by reference to an amount other
than taxable income, that amount shall be treated as the taxable income of the taxpayer for purposes of section 6662(e)(3).
Accordingly, for taxpayers whose regular tax is determined by reference to an amount other than taxable income, the
increase in that amount resulting from section 482 allocations is the taxpayer's net section 482 adjustment.




(6) 

Examples.

 The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples.



Example 1.

 (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year:

<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



 

(ii) The taxpayer has gross receipts of seventy-five million 
dollars after all section 482 adjustments. The taxpayer 
establishes that for adjustments number one and three, it applied 
a transfer pricing method specified in section 482, the selection 
and application of the method was reasonable, it documented the 
pricing analysis, and turned that documentation over to the IRS 
within 30 days of a request. Accordingly, eighteen million 
dollars is excluded from the calculation of the net section 482 
adjustment. Because the net section 482 adjustment is two 
million dollars, there is no substantial valuation misstatement. 



Example 2. 

(i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the 
following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: 



 


(ii) The taxpayer has gross receipts of seventy-five million dollars after all section 482 adjustments. The taxpayer
establishes that for adjustments number one and three it applied a transfer pricing method specified in section 482,
the selection and application of the method was reasonable, it documented that analysis, and turned the documentation
over to the IRS within 30 days. Accordingly, eighteen million dollars is excluded from the calculation of the section
482 transfer pricing adjustments for purposes of applying the five million dollar or 10% of gross receipts test. Because
the net section 482 adjustment is only two million dollars, the taxpayer is not subject to the net adjustment penalty.
However, the taxpayer may be subject to the transactional penalty on the underpayment of tax attributable to the two
million dollar adjustment. 



Example 3. 

CFC1 and CFC2 are controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957. Applying section 482, the IRS
disallows a deduction for twenty five million dollars of the interest that CFCI paid to CFC2, which results in CFC1's
U.S. shareholder having a subpart F inclusion in excess of five million dollars. No other adjustments under section
482 are made with respect to the controlled taxpayers. However, the increase has no effect upon the determination
of CFC1's or CFC2's income from sources within the United States or taxable income effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Accordingly, there is no substantial valuation misstatement.




(e) 

Special rules in the case of carrybacks and carryovers. 

If there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement for a taxable year that gives rise to a loss, deduction or
credit that is carried to another taxable year, the transactional penalty and the net adjustment penalty will be imposed
on any resulting underpayment of tax in that other taxable year. In determining whether there is a substantial or gross
valuation misstatement for a taxable year, no amount carried from another taxable year shall be included. The following
example illustrates the principle of this paragraph (e).

 





Example. 

The Internal Revenue Service makes a section 482 adjustment of six million dollars in taxable year 1, no portion of
which is excluded under paragraph (d) of this section. The taxpayer's income tax return for year 1 reported a loss of
three million dollars, which was carried to taxpayer's year 2 year income tax return and used to reduce income taxes
otherwise due with respect to year 2. A determination is made that the six million dollar allocation constitutes a
substantial valuation misstatement, and a penalty is imposed on the underpayment of tax in year 1 attributable to
the substantial valuation misstatement and on the underpayment of tax in year 2 attributable to the disallowance
of the net operating loss in year 2. For purposes of determining whether there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
for year 2, the three million dollar reduction of the net operating loss will not be added to any section 482 adjustments
made with respect to year 2.

 



(f) 

Rules for coordinating between the transactional penalty and the net adjustment penalty_

(1) 

Coordination of a net section 482 adjustment subject to the net adjustment penalty and a gross valuation misstatement
subject to the transactional penalty. 

In determining whether a net section 482 adjustment exceeds five million dollars or 10 percent of gross receipts,
an adjustment attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement that is subject to the transactional
penalty will be taken into account. If the net section 482 adjustment exceeds five million dollars or ten percent of
gross receipts, any portion of such amount that is attributable to a gross valuation misstatement will be subject
to the transactional penalty at the forty percent rate, but will not also be subject to net adjustment penalty at a twenty
percent rate. The remaining amount is subject to the net adjustment penalty at the twenty percent rate, even if such
amount is less than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts. 




(2) 

Coordination of net section 482 adjustment subject to the net adjustment penalty and substantial valuation misstatements
subject to the transactional penalty. 

If the net section 482 adjustment exceeds twenty million dollars or 20 percent of gross receipts, the entire amount
of the adjustment is subject to the net adjustment penalty at a forty percent rate. No portion of the adjustment is subject
to the transactional penalty at a twenty percent rate.




(3) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (f). 






Example 1. 

(i) Applying section 482, the Internal Revenue Service makes the following adjustments for the taxable year:








</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 



(ii) The taxpayer has gross receipts of 75 million dollars after all section 482 adjustments. None of the adjustments
is excluded under paragraph (d) (Amounts excluded from net section 482 adjustments) of this section, in determining
the five million dollar or 10% of gross receipts test under section 6662(e)(1)(B)(ii). The net section 482 adjustment
(4.5 million dollars) is less than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts ($75 million
 x  10% = $7.5 million). Thus, there is no substantial valuation misstatement. However, the two million dollar
adjustment is attributable to a gross valuation misstatement. Accordingly, the taxpayer may be subject to a penalty,
under section 6662(h), equal to 40 percent of the underpayment of tax attributable to the gross valuation misstatement
of two million dollars. The 2.5 million dollar adjustment is not subject to a penalty under section 6662(b)(3).






Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1, 

except 
the taxpayer has gross receipts of 40 million dollars. The net 
section 482 adjustment ($4.5 million) is greater than the lesser 
of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts ($40 
million  x  10% = $4 million). Thus, the five million dollar or 
10% of gross receipts test has been met. The two million dollar 
adjustment is attributable to a gross valuation misstatement. 
Accordingly, the taxpayer is subject to a penalty, under section 
6662(h), equal to 40 percent of the underpayment of tax 
attributable to the gross valuation misstatement of two million 
dollars. The 2.5 million dollar adjustment is subject to a 
penalty under sections 6662(a) and 6662(b)(3), equal to 20 
percent of the underpayment of tax attributable to the 
substantial valuation misstatement. 






Example 

3. (i) Applying section 482, the Internal Revenue 
Service makes the following transfer pricing adjustments for the 
taxable year:

 


 



(ii) None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph 
(d) (Amounts excluded from net section 482 adjustments) in 
determining the twenty million dollar or 20% of gross receipts 
test under section 6662(h). The net section 482 adjustment (21 
million dollars) is greater than twenty million dollars and thus 
constitutes a gross valuation misstatement. Accordingly, the 
total adjustment is subject to the net adjustment penalty equal 
to 40 percent of the underpayment of tax attributable to the 21 
million dollar gross valuation misstatement. The six million 
dollar adjustment will not be separately included for purposes of 
any additional penalty under section 6662.




(g) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1993. 



Par. 5. 

Section 1.6664-O is amended by adding an entry for  1.6664-4T to read as follows:

For purposes of 
applying the reasonable cause and good faith exception of section

that does not satisfy 
the rules of  1.6662-T(d) for a net section 482 adjustment 
cannot satisfy the reasonable cause and good faith exception 
under section 6664(c). The rules of this section apply to 
underpayments subject to the transactional penalty in  1.6662-6T(b). If the standards of the net section
482 penalty exclusion 
provisions under  1.6662-6T(d) are met with respect to such 
underpayments, then the taxpayer will be considered to have acted 
with reasonable cause and good faith for purposes of this

Debt Instruments With Original Issue Discount; Imputed Interest 
on Deferred Payment Sales or Exchanges of Property 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations relating to 
the tax treatment of debt instruments with original issue 
discount and the imputation of interest on deferred payments 
under certain contracts for the sale or exchange of property. 
The final regulations provide needed guidance to holders and 
issuers of debt instruments with original issue discount and to 
buyers and sellers of property. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collections of information contained in this final 
regulation have been reviewed and approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 
1545-1353. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies 
from .3 hours to .5 hours, depending on individual circumstances, 
with an estimated average of .4 hours. 
These estimates are an approximation of the average time 
expected to be necessary for a collection of information. They 
are based on such information as is available to the IRS. 
Individual respondents may require more or less time, depending 
on their particular circumstances. 
Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and 
suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the 
Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, 
PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management 
and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the 
Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Washington, DC 20503. 


Background 


On December 22, 1992, the IRS published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 60750) relating to 
original issue discount (OID) under section 163(e) and sections 
1271 through 1275 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The 
notice also contained proposed amendments to the regulations 
under sections 446 (relating to the accrual of interest), 483 
(relating to unstated interest), 1001 (relating to amount 
realized), and 1012 (relating to basis). The notice withdrew 
most of the proposed regulations that were previously published 
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 8, 1986 (51 FR 12022), as 
amended on May 7, 1991 (56 FR 21112), and July 12, 1991 (56 FR 
31887). 
On February 16, 1993, the IRS held a public hearing on the 
proposed regulations. In addition, the IRS received a number of 
written comments on the proposed regulations. The proposed 
regulations, with certain changes to respond to comments, are 
adopted as final regulations; to permit further comment,  1.446-2(e)(3) remains outstanding in proposed
form. The changes, as 
well as several comments and suggestions that were not adopted in 
the final regulations, are discussed below. 


Explanation of Provisions 


Section 1.163-7 Deduction for OID on Certain Debt Instruments
 


The final regulations retain the rule of the proposed 
regulations that allows the issuer of a debt instrument to deduct 
de minimis OID using a straight line method. As requested by a 
commentator, the final regulations also allow the issuer the 
choice of deducting de minimis OID at maturity or in proportion 
to stated interest payments. 
Because the proposed regulations permit flexible accrual 
periods, a commentator requested guidance on what accrual period 
controls to determine whether a debt instrument is an applicable 
high yield debt obligation under section 163(i). The final 
regulations provide that the issuer's choice of accrual periods 
governs for purposes of section 163(i).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A commentator requested that an immediate deduction be 
allowed for a repurchase premium in a debt-for-debt exchange even 
if the issue price of the debt instrument received in the 
exchange is determined under section 1274. The IRS and Treasury, 
however, believe that taxpayers could inappropriately accelerate 
deductions in these situations because of the flexibility 
inherent in section 1274 for determining the issue price of a 
debt instrument. Thus, the final regulations retain the rule in 
the proposed regulations. 



Section 1.446-2 Method of Accounting for Interest



The proposed regulations provide a special payment 
allocation rule for certain small transactions. Because of the 
rule's limited scope and uncertainty regarding its application, 
the IRS and Treasury believe that the rule should not be 
finalized. However, to allow further comment on the need for 
this rule,  1.446-2(e)(3) is reserved in the final regulations 
and remains in proposed form. 


Section 1.483-1 Through 1.483-3 Unstated Interest 


The proposed regulations provide that stated or unstated 
interest under a contract subject to section 483 is taken into 
account under a taxpayer's regular method of accounting. One 
commentator suggested that an accrual method taxpayer should 
account for unstated interest in the year a payment is due, which 
was the rule in previous final regulations under section 483. 
The IRS and Treasury, however, believe that it is appropriate to 
treat stated and unstated interest consistently. Thus, the final 
regulations retain the rule in the proposed regulations. 


Sections 1.1001-1(g) and 1.1012-1(g) Amount Realized and Basis
 


If a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the 
proposed regulations provide that the issue price of the debt 
instrument is used to determine the seller's amount realized and 
the buyer's basis. The final regulations adopt the rules of the 
proposed regulations, but clarify the treatment of a debt 
instrument with an issue price determined under section 
1273(b)(4). 


Section 1.1271-1 Special Rules Applicable to Amounts Received on 
Retirement, Sale, or Exchange of Debt Instruments
 


As requested by a commentator, the final regulations provide 
that the intention to call rules do not apply to debt instruments 
sold pursuant to a private placement memorandum that is 
distributed to more than ten offerees and that is subject to 
certain sanctions of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. 


Section 1.1272-1 Current Inclusion of OID in Income
 


The proposed regulations provide that accrual periods may be 
of any length and may vary in length over the term of the debt 
instrument, provided that each accrual period is not longer than 
one year and that all payments are made at the end of an accrual 
period. In response to one comment, the final regulations 
provide that payments also may be made on the first day of an 
accrual period. 
The rule permitting accrual periods to vary in length was 
provided in response to commentators who criticized the prior 
proposed regulations as too mechanical and inflexible. While 
commentators commended the flexibility of the rule, they noted 
that the rule raised several technical issues: (1) the accrual 
periods used to determine whether an instrument is an applicable 
high yield debt obligation under section 163(i); (2) the accrual 
periods used by a subsequent holder to determine adjusted issue 
price for purposes of OID accruals, market discount, and 
acquisition premium; and (3) the accrual periods used for Form 
1099 reporting. As noted above,  1.163-7 of the final 
regulations provides that the issuer's determination of accrual 
periods controls for purposes of determining whether a debt 
instrument is an applicable high yield debt obligation. In 
addition,  1.1275-1(b)(2) of the final regulations provides that 
a subsequent holder determines adjusted issue price for purposes 
of OID accruals, market discount, and acquisition premium in any 
manner consistent with these final regulations. Rules on Form 
1099 reporting will be addressed in a separate project. Until 
guidance regarding Form 1099 reporting is issued, however, an 
issuer should use the same accrual periods for Form 1099 purposes 
as it uses for computing OID deductions. 
The proposed regulations provide rules to determine the 
yield and maturity of a debt instrument with a stated contingency 
that could result in the acceleration or deferral of payments if 
the timing and amounts payable upon occurrence of the contingency 
are fixed. The contingency is ignored unless, based on all the 
facts and circumstances, the contingency is more likely than not 
to occur. The final regulations clarify that this rule applies 
when the contingency, if triggered, would result in an 
alternative payment schedule as long as the timing and amounts of 
the payments comprising the alternative payment schedule are 
known as of the issue date. The final regulations also clarify 
that these rules apply if the debt instrument is subject to 
multiple contingencies that result in alternative payment 
schedules. The final regulations retain the rule in the proposed 
regulations for determining the yield and the maturity of a debt 
instrument in the case of a put or call option.

<TEXT>
 

The final regulations modify the proposed rules regarding subsequent adjustments that are required when a contingency
occurs (or does not occur) contrary to the assumption initially made. This modification treats both the acceleration
and deferral of payments as a deemed reissuance for purposes of OID accruals. In addition, the subsequent adjustment
rules are coordinated with the new pro rata prepayment rule described below in connection with the description of
 1.1275-2. 

Finally, in response to a comment, an example describing the consequences of a pay-in-kind debt instrument issued
at par has been included in the final regulations. 



Section 1.1272-2 Treatment of Debt Instruments Purchased at a Premium
 



The final regulations retain the rules in the proposed regulations for debt instruments purchased at a premium. Thus,
the holder's basis in a debt instrument that is acquired in exchange for property and that otherwise would take a substituted
basis generally will not exceed the fair market value of the property immediately after the exchange. This rule corresponds
to a similar rule in section 171(b)(4) of the Code. The final regulations clarify the application of the rule to a situation
in which a debt instrument is received in a distribution from a partnership. 



Section 1.1272-3 Election by a Holder to Treat all Interest on a Debt Instrument as OID 



The proposed regulations permit accrual method holders to treat all interest on a debt instrument as OID. In response
to comments, the final regulations extend this election to holders that use the cash receipts and disbursements method
of accounting. 



Section 1.1273-1 Definition of OID 



The final regulations retain the definition of qualified stated interest, but clarify that a conversion feature
is ignored for purposes of determining whether stated interest is unconditionally payable. In response to a comment,
the final regulations provide that if a debt instrument has payment intervals that are equal in length throughout
the term of the instrument, except for the first or final payment interval (or both intervals), the interest payment
for that interval (or intervals) is considered to be made at a fixed rate if the value of the rate on which the payment
is based is adjusted in any reasonable manner to take into account the length of the interval. The final regulations
also clarify the determination of qualified stated interest for a debt instrument that provides for an alternative
payment schedule (or schedules) upon the occurrence of one or more contingencies. In the case of these debt instruments,
each alternative payment schedule (including the stated payment schedule) is treated as if it were the debt instrument's
sole payment schedule. Based on this analysis, the debt instrument provides for qualified stated interest to the
extent of the lowest fixed rate at which qualified stated interest would be payable under any payment schedule. 

The final regulations also provide rules for a subsequent holder's treatment of a debt instrument issued with de minimis
OID. Under these rules, if a subsequent holder purchases the debt instrument at a premium, the subsequent holder does
not include any de minimis OID in income. Because the debt instrument is treated as having zero OID under section 1273(a)(3),
if a subsequent holder purchases the debt instrument at a discount, the subsequent holder reports the discount under
the market discount rules of sections 1276 through 1278 of the Code, rather than under the rules for de minimis OID.


Finally, the final regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations that de minimis OID is includible in the
income of the holder as principal payments are made. Commentators objected to the fact that this rule is written as
applying on a loan-by-loan basis because it could preclude a financial institution from using the loan liquidation
method. Although the rule is stated in terms of a single loan, the IRS and Treasury recognize that it may be appropriate
to permit financial institutions to account for de minimis OID on an aggregate basis. The IRS is reviewing its published
position with respect to the loan liquidation method and plans to issue updated guidance that permits financial institutions
to use some form of aggregate accounting. 



Section 1.1273-2 Determination of Issue Price and Issue Date 



If an issue of debt instruments sold for money is publicly offered, the proposed regulations provide that the issue
price of each debt instrument in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt instruments in
the issue is sold to the public. However, if the issue is not publicly offered, the issue price of each debt instrument
in the issue is the price paid by the first buyer of a debt instrument that is part of the issue. Commentators suggested
that the issue price rules should be the same for publicly offered and non-publicly offered issues. In addition, commentators
suggested that all debt instruments in an issue should be fungible with other debt instruments in the issue.

In response to these comments, the definition of issue price has been modified. Under the final regulations, if a substantial
amount of debt instruments in an issue is sold for money, the issue price of each instrument in the issue is the first
price at which a substantial amount is sold for money. If an issue is not subject to this rule, but a substantial amount
of the instruments in the issue is publicly traded, the issue price of each instrument in the issue is the fair market
value of the instrument as of the issue date. If an issue is not subject to either of these rules, but a substantial amount
of instruments in the issue is issued in exchange for publicly traded property, the issue price of each instrument
in the issue is the fair market value of the property as of the issue date. Finally, if an issue of debt instruments is
not described in any of the above rules, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is determined as if the instrument
were a separate issue. 

The proposed regulations define publicly traded property generally to include exchange listed property, property
traded on a board of trade or an interbank market, property appearing on a quotation medium, and debt instruments for
which price quotations are readily available. In response to a comment, the final regulations clarify that, for purposes
of determining whether an instrument is publicly traded, a quotation medium is limited to a medium that provides a
reasonable basis to determine fair market value. One commentator suggested that the rule regarding readily available
price quotations should be eliminated. The IRS and Treasury, however, believe that one principal way in which debt
instruments are traded is through brokers and dealers from whom price quotations are readily available, that this
market is liquid, and that instruments so traded are susceptible to ready valuation. In such a case, it is consistent
with the purposes of the rules applicable to publicly traded property that the instruments be considered publicly
traded. 

The final regulations clarify the determination of issue price for a debt instrument that is part of an investment
unit. In general, the issue price of an investment unit is determined as if the investment unit were a debt instrument.
The issue price of the investment unit is then allocated between the debt instrument and the property right that comprise
the investment unit based on their relative fair market values. If, however, the issue price of the investment unit
is not determined under the rules of paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of  1.1273-2 (e.g., because the
investment unit is not issued for money or publicly traded property), the issue price of the debt instrument included
in the investment unit is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274, whichever is applicable. 

To coordinate the definition of issue date with the revised definition of issue price discussed above, the definition
of issue date has been moved from  1.1275-1 of the proposed regulations to  1.1273-2 of the
final regulations. 



Sections 1.1274-1 Through 1.1274-5 Determination of Issue Price in the Case of Certain Debt Instruments
Issued for Property 



The final regulations modify the rule to determine the test rate for purposes of sections 483 and 1274. Under the modified
rule, the test rate is generally the lowest of the applicable Federal rates (based on the appropriate compounding
period) in effect during either (i) the 3-month period ending with the first month in which there is a binding written
contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated, or (ii)
the 3-month period ending with the month in which the sale or exchange occurs. 

The proposed regulations generally provide that the imputed principal amount of a contingent payment debt instrument
is the sum of the present values of the noncontingent payments and the fair market value of the contingent payments.
Several comments and questions were received on this rule, including the comment that the rule should be reserved
pending the resolution of the contingent payment rules in regulations under section 1275. To allow further study
of this issue and coordination with the contingent payment regulations under section 1275, the final regulations
do not adopt the rule in the proposed regulations. Thus, for example, consistent with existing authorities, the value
of contingent payments is not taken into account for purposes of determining the basis of property under section 1012.
With the publication of the final regulations in the 

Federal Register

,  1.1274-2(e) of the proposed regulations no longer remains as a proposed regulation. Pending resolution
of the issue and publication of new proposed regulations, paragraphs (c) and (d) of  1.1275-4 of the proposed
regulations, as proposed in 1986, remain authority under section 6662 of the Code for a nonpublicly traded debt instrument
issued in exchange for nonpublicly traded property.

Section 1.1274A-1 Special Rules for Certain Transactions Where 
Stated Principal Amount Does Not Exceed $2,800,000



No comments were received on these regulations and no 
material changes were made to this section. 



Section 1.1275-1 Definitions



In response to a comment, the definition of issue has been 
expanded. As a result, debt instruments issued in different 
markets or for different consideration can be part of the same 
issue. 



Section 1.1275-2 Special Rules Relating to Debt Instruments



The proposed regulations provide that all payments (other 
than qualified stated interest payments) consist first of accrued 
but unpaid OID, then of principal. Several commentators 
suggested that unscheduled prepayments should be treated as 
partial retirements of the debt instrument. In response to these 
comments, the final regulations add new rules for the treatment 
of pro rata prepayments. In general, a pro rata prepayment is an 
unscheduled payment made on a debt instrument prior to maturity 
that results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each 
payment of principal and interest remaining on the instrument. 
If a prepayment on a debt instrument is a pro rata prepayment, 
the prepayment is treated as a payment in retirement of a portion 
of the instrument, which may result in gain or loss to the 
holder. The gain or loss is calculated by assuming that the debt 
instrument consists of two instruments, one that is retired and 
one that remains outstanding, and by allocating the adjusted 
issue price, the holder's adjusted basis, and the accrued but 
unpaid qualified stated interest between the two instruments 
based on the portion of the instrument that is treated as retired 
by the pro rata prepayment. In the case of a pro rata 
prepayment, the issuer may realize discharge of indebtedness 
income (as determined under  1.61-12) or repurchase premium (as 
determined under  1.163-7). 

Partial retirement treatment is restricted to pro rata 
prepayments because the IRS and Treasury believe that this type 
of prepayment is common. The extension of the rule to non-pro 
rata prepayments would add undue complexity to the regulations. 
In addition, extension of the rule to non-pro rata prepayments 
may cause inappropriate recognition of gain or loss if, in 
addition to a prepayment, the interest rate or the payment 
schedule is altered. Furthermore, as noted by one commentator, a 
rule for non-pro rata prepayments may not be necessary because an 
unscheduled prepayment may, depending on the circumstances, 
result in a deemed exchange under section 1001. 

The proposed regulations contain a number of rules that 
generally require a holder to follow the issuer's treatment of an 
item, such as whether a debt instrument is issued in a 
potentially abusive situation. In response to comments, the 
final regulations provide that the issuer must make information 
relating to its treatment of the item available to the holder in 
a reasonable manner. 

Section 1.1275-2T, which is published elsewhere in this 
issue of the 

Federal Register

, provides for an anti-abuse rule. 
Under the rule, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in certain 
circumstances, can apply or depart from the final regulations in 
a manner that ensures a reasonable result in light of the 
purposes of the statutes governing OID.

Section 1.1275-3 OID Information Reporting Requirements



The legending requirements in the final regulations for debt 
instruments with OID are generally the same as the requirements 
in the proposed regulations. 



Section 1.1275-5 Variable Rate Debt Instruments



In response to comments that the definition of a variable 
rate debt instrument contained in the proposed regulations is 
overly restrictive, the final regulations liberalize the rules in 
several respects. First, the regulations allow the issue price 
of a variable rate debt instrument to exceed the total 
noncontingent principal payments on the instrument, provided that 
the excess is not greater than a specified amount. Second, the 
regulations allow a variable rate debt instrument to provide for 
stated interest at more than two qualified floating rates, at a 
single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates, and 
at a single fixed rate and an objective rate that is a qualified 
inverse floating rate. Third, the regulations provide that 
interest that is stated at an initial fixed rate for a period of 
not more than one year, followed by a qualified floating rate or 
an objective rate, is treated as stated at a single qualified 
floating rate or an objective rate in certain circumstances. 
This rule applies, for example, if interest for the initial 
accrual period is set a short time prior to the issue date at a 
fixed rate chosen to approximate the expected value of the 
qualified floating rate or objective rate on the issue date. 
Fourth, the regulations allow certain multiples of a qualified 
floating rate to be treated as qualified floating rates. Fifth, 
the regulations expand the definition of an objective rate to 
include a rate based on the yield of actively traded property, a 
rate that would be a qualified floating rate if the debt 
instrument were denominated in a foreign currency, and any 
combination of objective rates. In addition, the final 
regulations provide that other rates may be treated as objective 
rates if designated by revenue ruling or revenue procedure. 



In response to a comment, the definition of an objective 
rate has been narrowed in two respects. While the proposed 
regulations permit a rate based on the price of actively traded 
personal property, the final regulations permit only a rate based 
on the change in the price of actively traded personal property 
to be an objective rate. In addition, the final regulations 
provide a more general rule relating to the frontloading or 
backloading of interest such that a variable rate is not an 
objective rate if it results in significant frontloading or 
backloading of interest. 

The rules in the proposed regulations relating to 
permissible objective rates on tax-exempt debt instruments have 
been changed in the final regulations. Under the revised rules, 
a variable rate on a tax-exempt debt instrument is an objective 
rate only if it is a qualified inverse floating rate. In 
general, an objective rate is a qualified inverse floating rate 
if the rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating 
rate and the rate varies in a manner that inversely reflects 
contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. 

The rules in the proposed regulations for determining the 
accrual of OID and the amount of qualified stated interest on a 
variable rate debt instrument have been revised and simplified in 
the final regulations. Under the revised rules, a debt 
instrument providing for qualified floating rates is converted to 
an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument by assuming that each 
qualified floating rate will remain at its value as of the issue 
date. A debt instrument providing for an objective rate is 
converted to an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument by assuming 
that the objective rate will equal a fixed rate that reflects the 
yield that is reasonably expected for the instrument. The rules 
applicable to fixed rate debt instruments are then applied to 
determine the OID accruals and the qualified stated interest 
payments on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. 
Appropriate adjustments to these amounts are made in each accrual 
period if the interest actually accrued or paid during the 
accrual period is greater than or less than the interest assumed 
to be accrued or paid under the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument.

In response to a comment, the final regulations provide a 
special rule for certain variable rate debt instruments (such as 
auction rate or adjustable rate debt instruments) that provide 
for a fixed rate of interest for an initial period, followed by a 
period during which the interest is reset to a rate that will 
enable the instrument to trade at a fixed amount when the reset 
becomes effective. Under this special rule, the debt instrument 
is treated as maturing on the date the reset rate becomes 
effective and reissued on that date for the fixed amount. As a 
result of this rule, for example, if a debt instrument is issued 
at a discount (i.e., the issue price of the debt instrument is 
less than its par value) and is reset to par after an initial 
period, the discount on the instrument will be accrued entirely 
in the initial period rather than over the full term of the 
instrument. 


Effective Dates 


These regulations apply to debt instruments issued on or 
after April 4, 1994, and to lending transactions, 
sales, and exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. However,  1.1272-3 applies to debt instruments

acquired on or after April 4, 1994, and 
 1.1275-2(d)(2) applies to qualified reopenings that occur on or 
after March 25, 1992. 


Reliance on Final Regulations 


Except for  1.1272-3, taxpayers may rely on the final 
regulations for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, 
and for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occur 
after December 21, 1992. 


Authority Under Section 6662


Although the final regulations dispose of the underlying 
proposed regulations (other than  1.446-2(e)(3)), the IRS will 
allow taxpayers to treat the proposed regulations as authority 
under section 6662 of the Code for debt instruments issued after 
December 21, 1992, and prior to April 4, 1994, and 
for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occurred 
after December 21, 1992, and prior to April 4, 1994. 
The IRS also will allow taxpayers to treat the OID regulations 
that were proposed in 1986 and 1991 as authority under section 
6662 for debt instruments issued prior to December 22, 1992, and 
for lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occurred 
prior to December 22, 1992. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that these regulations are not major 
rules as defined in Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a 
Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. It also has been 
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking was submitted to the Small Business Administration for 
comment on its impact on small business. 


Drafting Information 


The principal authors of these regulations are William E. 
Blanchard and Andrew C. Kittler of the Office of Assistant Chief 
Counsel (Financial Institutions and Products), IRS. However, 
other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated 
in their development.

Par. 2. 

Section 1.163-7 is added to read as follows: 


 1.163-7

Deduction for OID on certain debt instruments. 


(a) 

General rule.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section, an issuer (including a transferee) 
determines the amount of OID that is deductible each year under 
section 163(e)(1) by using the constant yield method described in 
 1.1272-1(b). This determination, however, is made without 
regard to section 1272(a)(7) (relating to acquisition premium) 
and  1.1273-1(d) (relating to de minimis OID). An issuer is 
permitted a deduction under section 163(e)(1) only to the extent 
the issuer is primarily liable on the debt instrument. For 
certain limitations on the deductibility of OID, see sections 
163(e) and 1275(b)(2). 
(b) 

Special rules for de minimis OID

_(1) 

Stated interest

. 
If a debt instrument has a de minimis amount of OID (within the 
meaning of  1.1273-1(d)), the issuer treats all stated interest 
on the debt instrument as qualified stated interest. See 
  1.446-2(b) and 1.461-1 for the treatment of qualified stated 
interest. 
(2) 

Deduction of de minimis OID on other than a constant 
yield basis.

 In lieu of deducting de minimis OID under the 
general rule of paragraph (a) of this section, an issuer of a 
debt instrument with a de minimis amount of OID (other than a de 
minimis amount treated as qualified stated interest under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section) may choose to deduct the OID at 
maturity, on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt 
instrument, or in proportion to stated interest payments. The 
issuer makes this choice by reporting the de minimis OID in a 
manner consistent with the method chosen on the issuer's timely 
filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the 
debt instrument is issued. 
(c) 

Deduction upon repurchase.

 Except to the extent 
disallowed by any other section of the Internal Revenue Code 
(e.g., section 249) or this paragraph (c), if a debt instrument 
is repurchased by the issuer for a price in excess of its 
adjusted issue price (as defined in  1.1275-1(b)), the excess 
(repurchase premium) is deductible as interest for the taxable 
year in which the repurchase occurs. If the issuer repurchases a 
debt instrument in a debt-for-debt exchange, the repurchase price 
is the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument (reduced 
by any unstated interest within the meaning of section 483). 
However, if the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument 
is determined under either section 1273(b)(4) or section 1274, 
any repurchase premium is not deductible in the year of the 
repurchase, but is amortized over the term of the newly issued 
debt instrument in the same manner as if it were OID. 
(d) 

Choice of accrual periods to determine whether a debt 
instrument is an applicable high yield discount obligation 
(AHYDO).

 Section 163(e)(5) affects an issuer's OID deductions 
for certain high yield debt instruments that have significant 
OID. For purposes of section 163(i)(2), which defines 
significant OID, the issuer's choice of accrual periods to 
determine OID accruals is used to determine whether a debt 
instrument has significant OID. See  1.1275-2(e) for rules 
relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain 
information to holders. 
(e) 

Effective date.

 This section applies to debt 
instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for debt instruments issued
after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.


 1.163-11T

[Removed] 




Par. 3.

 Section 1.163-11T is removed as of February 2, 1994. 


Par. 4.

 Section 1.446-2 is added to read as follows: 


 1.446-2

Method of accounting for interest. 


(a) 

Applicability

_(1) 

In general.

 This section provides 
rules for determining the amount of interest that accrues during 
an accrual period (other than interest described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section) and for determining the portion of a 
payment that consists of accrued interest. For purposes of this 
section, interest includes original issue discount and amounts 
treated as interest (whether stated or unstated) in any lending 
or deferred payment transaction. Accrued interest determined 
under this section is taken into account by a taxpayer under the 
taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method 
or the cash receipts and disbursements method). Application of 
an exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to one 
party to a transaction does not affect the application of this 
section to any other party to the transaction.

(2) 

Exceptions

_(i) 

Interest included or deducted under 
certain other provisions.

 This section does not apply to 
interest that is taken into account under_

(A) Sections 1272(a), 1275, and 163(e) (income and 
deductions relating to original issue discount); 

(B) Section 467(a)(2) (certain payments for the use of 
property or services); 

(C) Sections 1276 through 1278 (market discount); 

(D) Sections 1281 through 1283 (discount on certain short-term obligations); 

(E) Section 7872(a) (certain loans with below-market 
interest rates); or 

(F) Section 1.1272-3 (an election by a holder to treat all 
interest on a debt instrument as original issue discount). 

(ii) 

De minimis original issue discount.

 This section does 
not apply to de minimis original issue discount (other than de 
minimis original issue discount treated as qualified stated 
interest) as determined under  1.1273-1(d). See  1.163-7 for 
the treatment of de minimis original issue discount by the issuer 
and   1.1273-1(d) and 1.1272-3 for the treatment of de minimis 
original issue discount by the holder. 

(b) 

Accrual of qualified stated interest.

 Qualified stated 
interest (as defined in  1.1273-1(c)) accrues ratably over the 
accrual period (or periods) to which it is attributable and 
accrues at the stated rate for the period (or periods). 

(c) 

Accrual of interest other than qualified stated 
interest.

 Subject to the modifications in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the amount of interest (other than qualified stated 
interest) that accrues for any accrual period is determined under 
rules similar to those in the regulations under sections 1272 and 
1275 for the accrual of original issue discount. The preceding 
sentence applies regardless of any contrary formula agreed to by 
the parties. 

(d) 

Modifications

_(1) 

Issue price.

 The issue price of the 
loan or contract is equal to_

(i) In the case of a contract for the sale or exchange of 
property to which section 483 applies, the amount described in 
 1.483-2(a)(1)(i) or (ii), whichever is applicable; 

(ii) In the case of a contract for the sale or exchange of 
property to which section 483 does not apply, the stated 
principal amount; or 

(iii) In any other case, the amount loaned. 

(2) 

Principal payments that are not deferred payments.

 In 
the case of a contract to which section 483 applies, principal 
payments that are not deferred payments are ignored for purposes 
of determining yield and adjusted issue price. 

(e) 

Allocation of interest to payments

_(1) 

In general.

 
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of 
this section, each payment under a loan (other than payments of 
additional interest or similar charges provided with respect to 
amounts that are not paid when due) is treated as a payment of 
interest to the extent of the accrued and unpaid interest 
determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section as of the 
date the payment becomes due. 

(2) 

Special rule for points deductible under section 
461(g)(2).

 If a payment of points is deductible by the borrower 
under section 461(g)(2), the payment is treated by the borrower 
as a payment of interest. 

(3) 

Allocation respected in certain small transactions.

 
[Reserved] 

(4) 

Pro rata prepayments.

 Accrued but unpaid interest is 
allocated to a pro rata prepayment under rules similar to those 
for allocating accrued but unpaid original issue discount to a 
pro rata prepayment under  1.1275-2(f). For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, a pro rata prepayment is a payment that is 
made prior to maturity that_

(i) Is not made pursuant to the contract's payment schedule; 
and 

(ii) Results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each 
payment remaining to be paid on the contract.

<TEXT>
 

(f) 

Aggregation rule.

 For purposes of this section, all 
contracts calling for deferred payments arising from the same 
transaction (or a series of related transactions) are treated as 
a single contract. This rule, however, generally only applies to 
contracts involving a single borrower and a single lender. 

(g) 

Debt instruments denominated in a currency other than 
the U.S. dollar.

 This section applies to a debt instrument that 
provides for all payments denominated in, or determined by 
reference to, the functional currency of the taxpayer or 
qualified business unit of the taxpayer (even if that currency is 
other than the U.S. dollar). See  1.988-2(b) to determine 
interest income or expense for debt instruments that provide for 
payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, a 
nonfunctional currency. 

(h) 

Example.

 The following example illustrates the rules of 
this section. 






Example. Allocation of unstated interest to deferred 
payments

_(i) 

Facts.

 On July 1, 1996, A sells his personal 
residence to B for a stated purchase price of $1,297,143.66. The 
property is not personal use property (within the meaning of 
section 1275(b)(3)) in the hands of B. Under the loan agreement, 
B is required to make two installment payments of $648,571.83 
each, the first due on June 30, 1998, and the second due on June 
30, 2000. Both A and B use the cash receipts and disbursements 
method of accounting and use a calendar year for their taxable 
year. 

(ii) 

Amount of unstated interest.

 Under section 483, the 
agreement does not provide for adequate stated interest. Thus, 
the loan's yield is the test rate of interest determined under 
 1.483-3. Assume that both A and B use annual accrual periods 
and that the test rate of interest is 9.2 percent, compounded 
annually. Under  1.483-2, the present value of the deferred 
payments is $1,000,000. Thus, the agreement has unstated 
interest of $297,143.66. 

(iii) 

First two accrual periods.

 Under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, the issue price at the beginning of the first 
accrual period is $1,000,000 (the amount described in  1.483-2(a)(1)(i)). Under paragraph (c) of this
section, the amount of 
interest that accrues for the first accrual period is $92,000 
($1,000,000 x .092) and the amount of interest that accrues for 
the second accrual period is $100,464 ($1,092,000 x .092). Thus, 
$192,464 of interest has accrued as of the end of the second 
accrual period. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the 
$648,571.83 payment made on June 30, 1998, is treated first as a 
payment of interest to the extent of $192,464. The remainder of 
the payment ($456,107.83) is treated as a payment of principal. 
Both A and B take the payment of interest ($192,464) into account 
in 1998. 

(iv) 

Second two accrual periods.

 The adjusted issue price 
at the beginning of the third accrual period is $543,892.17 
($1,092,000+$100,464-$648,571.83). The amount of interest 
that accrues for the third accrual period is $50,038.08 
($543,892.17 x .092) and the amount of interest that accrues for 
the final accrual period is $54,641.58, the excess of the amount 
payable at maturity ($648,571.83), over the adjusted issue price 
at the beginning of the accrual period ($593,930.25). As of the 
date the second payment becomes due, $104,679.66 of interest has 
accrued. Thus, of the $648,571.83 payment made on June 30, 2000, 
$104,679.66 is treated as interest and $543,892.17 is treated as 
principal. Both A and B take the payment of interest 
($104,679.66) into account in 2000. 




(i) [Reserved] 

(j) 

Effective date.

 This section applies to debt 
instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994, and to 
lending transactions, sales, and exchanges that occur on or after 
April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this 
section for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and 
before April 4, 1994, and for lending transactions, 
sales, and exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and 
before April 4, 1994.



Par. 5.

 Sections 1.483-1 and 1.483-2 are revised to read as 
follows: 



 1.483-1 

Interest on certain deferred payments. 



(a) 

Amount constituting interest in certain deferred payment 
transactions

_(1) 

In general.

 Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, section 483 applies to a contract for the 
sale or exchange of property if the contract provides for one or 
more payments due more than 1 year after the date of the sale or 
exchange, and the contract does not provide for adequate stated 
interest. In general, a contract has adequate stated interest if 
the contract provides for a stated rate of interest that is at 
least equal to the test rate (determined under  1.483-3) and the 
interest is paid or compounded at least annually. Section 483 
may apply to a contract whether the contract is express (written 
or oral) or implied. For purposes of section 483, a sale or 
exchange is any transaction treated as a sale or exchange for tax 
purposes. In addition, for purposes of section 483, property 
includes debt instruments and investment units, but does not 
include money, services, or the right to use property. For the 
treatment of certain obligations given in exchange for services 
or the use of property, see sections 404 and 467. For purposes 
of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in 
certain circumstances, nonfunctional currency. See  1.988-2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional
currency is treated 
as money rather than as property. 

(2) 

Treatment of contracts to which section 483 applies

_(i) 


Treatment of unstated interest.

 If section 483 applies to a 
contract, unstated interest under the contract is treated as 
interest for tax purposes. Thus, for example, unstated interest 
is not treated as part of the amount realized from the sale or 
exchange of property (in the case of the seller), and is not 
included in the purchaser's basis in the property acquired in the 
sale or exchange.

(ii) 

Method of accounting for interest on contracts subject 
to section 483.

 Any stated or unstated interest on a contract 
subject to section 483 is taken into account by a taxpayer under 
the taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual 
method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). See 
  1.446-1, 1.451-1, and 1.461-1. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, the amount of interest (including unstated interest) 
allocable to a payment under a contract to which section 483 
applies is determined under  1.446-2(e). 

(b) 

Definitions

_(1) 

Deferred payments.

 For purposes of the 
regulations under section 483, a deferred payment means any 
payment that constitutes all or a part of the sales price (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and that is due 
more than 6 months after the date of the sale or exchange. 
Except as provided in section 483(c)(2) (relating to the 
treatment of a debt instrument of the purchaser), a payment may 
be made in the form of cash, stock or securities, or other 
property. 

(2) 

Sales price.

 For purposes of section 483, the sales 
price for any sale or exchange is the sum of the amount due under 
the contract (other than stated interest) and the amount of any 
liability included in the amount realized from the sale or 
exchange. See  1.1001-2. Thus, the sales price for any sale or 
exchange includes any amount of unstated interest under the 
contract. 

(c) 

Exceptions to and limitations on the application of 
section 483

_(1) 

In general.

 Sections 483(d), 1274(c)(4), and 
1275(b) contain exceptions to and limitations on the application 
of section 483. 

(2) 

Sales price of $3,000 or less.

 Section 483(d)(2) 
applies only if it can be determined at the time of the sale or 
exchange that the sales price cannot exceed $3,000, regardless of 
whether the sales price eventually paid for the property is less 
than $3,000. 

(3) 

Other exceptions and limitations

_(i) 

Certain transfers 
subject to section 1041.

 Section 483 does not apply to any 
transfer of property subject to section 1041 (relating to 
transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce). 

(ii) 

Treatment of certain obligees.

 Section 483 does not 
apply to an obligee under a contract for the sale or exchange of 
personal use property (within the meaning of section 1275(b)(3)) 
in the hands of the obligor and that evidences a below-market 
loan described in section 7872(c)(1). 

(iii) 

Transactions involving certain demand loans.

 Section 
483 does not apply to any payment under a contract that evidences 
a demand loan that is a below-market loan described in section 
7872(c)(1). 

(iv) 

Transactions involving certain annuity contracts.

 
Section 483 does not apply to any payment under an annuity 
contract described in section 1275(a)(1)(B) (relating to annuity 
contracts excluded from the definition of debt instrument). 

(v) 

Options.

 Section 483 does not apply to any payment 
under an option to buy or sell property. 

(d) 

Assumptions.

 If a debt instrument is assumed, or 
property is taken subject to a debt instrument, in connection 
with a sale or exchange of property, the debt instrument is 
treated for purposes of section 483 in a manner consistent with 
the rules of  1.1274-5.

(e) 

Aggregation rule. 

For purposes of section 483, all 
sales or exchanges that are part of the same transaction (or a 
series of related transactions) are treated as a single sale or 
exchange, and all contracts calling for deferred payments arising 
from the same transaction (or a series of related transactions) 
are treated as a single contract. This rule, however, generally 
only applies to contracts and to sales or exchanges involving a 
single buyer and a single seller. 
(f) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to sales and 
exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. 
Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for sales and 
exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.



 1.483-2 

Unstated interest. 


(a) 

In general

_(1) 

Adequate stated interest. 

For purposes 
of section 483, a contract has unstated interest if the contract 
does not provide for adequate stated interest. A contract does 
not provide for adequate stated interest if the sum of the 
deferred payments exceeds_

(i) The sum of the present values of the deferred payments 
and the present values of any stated interest payments due under 
the contract; or 

(ii) In the case of a cash method debt instrument (within 
the meaning of section 1274A(c)(2)) received in exchange for 
property in a potentially abusive situation (as defined in 
 1.1274-3), the fair market value of the property reduced by the 
fair market value of any consideration other than the debt 
instrument, and reduced by the sum of all principal payments that 
are not deferred payments. 
(2) 

Amount of unstated interest. 

For purposes of section 
483, unstated interest means an amount equal to the excess of the 
sum of the deferred payments over the amount described in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section, whichever is 
applicable. 
(b) 

Operational rules_

(1) 

In general. 

For purposes of 
paragraph (a) of this section, rules similar to those in 
 1.1274-2 apply to determine whether a contract has adequate 
stated interest and the amount of unstated interest, if any, on 
the contract. 
(2) 

Present value. 

For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, the present value of any deferred payment or interest 
payment is determined by discounting the payment from the date it 
becomes due to the date of the sale or exchange at the test rate 
of interest applicable to the contract in accordance with 
 1.483-3. 
(c) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section. 





Example 1. Contract that does not have adequate stated 
interest. 

On January 1, 1995, A sells B nonpublicly traded 
property under a contract that calls for a $100,000 payment of 
principal on January 1, 2005, and 10 annual interest payments of 
$9,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. 
Assume that the test rate of interest is 9.2 percent, compounded 
annually. The contract does not provide for adequate stated 
interest because it does not provide for interest equal to 9.2 
percent, compounded annually. The present value of the deferred 
payments is $98,727.69. As a result, the contract has unstated 
interest of $1,272.31 ($100,000 ^ $98,727.69). 


Example 2. Contract that does not have adequate stated 
interest; no interest for initial short period. 

On May 1, 1996, 
A sells B nonpublicly traded property under a contract that calls 
for B to make a principal payment of $200,000 on December 31, 
1998, and semiannual interest payments of $9,000, payable on June 
30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on December 31, 1996. 
Assume that the test rate of interest is 9 percent, compounded 
semiannually. Even though the contract calls for a stated rate 
of interest no lower than the test rate of interest, the contract 
does not provide for adequate stated interest because the stated 
rate of interest does not apply for the short period from May 1, 
1996, through June 30, 1996. 


Example 3. Potentially abusive situation_

(i) 

Facts. 

In a 
potentially abusive situation, a contract for the sale of 
nonpublicly traded personal property calls for the issuance of a 
cash method debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(c)(2)) 
with a stated principal amount of $700,000, payable in 5 years. 
No other consideration is given. The debt instrument calls for 
annual payments of interest over its entire term at a rate of 9.2 
percent, compounded annually (the test rate of interest 
applicable to the debt instrument). Thus, the present value of 
the deferred payment and the interest payments is $700,000. 
Assume that the fair market value of the property is $500,000. 
(ii) 

Amount of unstated interest. 

A cash method debt 
instrument received in exchange for property in a potentially 
abusive situation provides for adequate stated interest only if 
the sum of the deferred payments under the instrument does not 
exceed the fair market value of the property. Because the 
deferred payment ($700,000) exceeds the fair market value of the 
property ($500,000), the debt instrument does not provide for 
adequate stated interest. Therefore, the debt instrument has 
unstated interest of $200,000. 


Example 4. Variable rate debt instrument with adequate 
stated interest; variable rate as of the issue date greater than 
the test rate_

(i) 

Facts. 

A contract for the sale of nonpublicly 
traded property calls for the issuance of a debt instrument in 
the principal amount of $75,000 due in 10 years. The debt 
instrument calls for interest payable semiannually at a rate of 3 
percentage points above the yield on 6-month Treasury bills at 
the mid-point of the semiannual period immediately preceding each 
interest payment date. Assume that the interest rate is a 
qualified floating rate and that the debt instrument is a 
variable rate debt instrument within the meaning of  1.1275-5. 
(ii) 

Adequate stated interest. 

Under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, rules similar to those in  1.1274-2(f) apply to 
determine whether the debt instrument has adequate stated 
interest. Assume that the test rate of interest applicable to 
the debt instrument is 9 percent, compounded semiannually. 
Assume also that the yield on 6-month Treasury bills on the date 
of the sale is 8.89 percent, which is greater than the yield on 
6-month Treasury bills on the first date on which there is a 
binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms 
under which the sale is consummated. Under  1.1274-2(f), the 
debt instrument is tested for adequate stated interest as if it 
provided for a stated rate of interest of 11.89 percent (3 
percent plus 8.89 percent), compounded semiannually, payable over 
its entire term. Because the test rate of interest is 9 percent, 
compounded semiannually, and the debt instrument is treated as 
providing for stated interest of 11.89 percent, compounded 
semiannually, the debt instrument provides for adequate stated 
interest. 



(d) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to sales and 
exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for sales and exchanges
that occur after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.

Par. 6. 

Section 1.483-3 is added to read as follows: 


 1.483-3 

Test rate of interest applicable to a contract. 


(a) 

General rule. 

For purposes of section 483, the test 
rate of interest for a contract is the same as the test rate that 
would apply under  1.1274-4 if the contract were a debt 
instrument. Paragraph (b) of this section, however, provides for 
a lower test rate in the case of certain sales or exchanges of 
land between related individuals. 
(b) 

Lower rate for certain sales or exchanges of land 
between related individuals_

(1) 

Test rate. 

In the case of a 
qualified sale or exchange of land between related individuals 
(described in section 483(e)), the test rate is not greater than 
6 percent, compounded semiannually, or an equivalent rate based 
on an appropriate compounding period. 
(2) 

Special rules. 

The following rules and definitions 
apply in determining whether a sale or exchange is a qualified 
sale under section 483(e): 
(i) 

Definition of family members. 

The members of an 
individual's family are determined as of the date of the sale or 
exchange. The members of an individual's family include those 
individuals described in section 267(c)(4) and the spouses of 
those individuals. In addition, for purposes of section 
267(c)(4), full effect is given to a legal adoption, ancestor 
means parents and grandparents, and lineal descendants means 
children and grandchildren. 
(ii) 

$500,000 limitation. 

Section 483(e) does not apply to 
the extent that the stated principal amount of the debt 
instrument issued in the sale or exchange, when added to the 
aggregate stated principal amount of any other debt instruments 
to which section 483(e) applies that were issued in prior 
qualified sales between the same two individuals during the same 
calendar year, exceeds $500,000. See 

Example 3 

of paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. 
(iii) 

Other limitations. 

Section 483(e) does not apply if 
the parties to a contract include persons other than the related 
individuals and the parties enter into the contract with an 
intent to circumvent the purposes of section 483(e). In 
addition, if the property sold or exchanged includes any property 
other than land, section 483(e) applies only to the extent that 
the stated principal amount of the debt instrument issued in the 
sale or exchange is attributable to the land (based on the 
relative fair market values of the land and the other property). 
(3) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this paragraph (b). 





Example 1. 

On January 1, 1995, A sells land to B, A's 
child, for $650,000. The contract for sale calls for B to make a 
$250,000 down payment and issue a debt instrument with a stated 
principal amount of $400,000. Because the stated principal 
amount of the debt instrument is less than $500,000, the sale is 
a qualified sale and section 483(e) applies to the debt 
instrument. 


Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1 

of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except that on June 1, 1995, A 
sells additional land to B under a contract that calls for B to 
issue a debt instrument with a stated principal amount of 
$100,000. The stated principal amount of this debt instrument 
($100,000) when added to the stated principal amount of the prior 
debt instrument ($400,000) does not exceed $500,000. Thus, 
section 483(e) applies to both debt instruments. 


Example 3. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1 

of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except that on June 1, 1995, A 
sells additional land to B under a contract that calls for B to 
issue a debt instrument with a stated principal amount of 
$150,000. The stated principal amount of this debt instrument 
when added to the stated principal amount of the prior debt 
instrument ($400,000) exceeds $500,000. Thus, for purposes of 
section 483(e), the debt instrument issued in the sale of June 1, 
1995, is treated as two separate debt instruments: a $100,000 
debt instrument (to which section 483(e) applies) and a $50,000 
debt instrument (to which section 1274, if otherwise applicable, 
applies). 



(c) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to sales and 
exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for sales and exchanges
that occur after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.




Par. 7. 

In  1.1001-1, paragraph (g) is revised to read as 
follows: 


 1.1001-1 

Computation of gain or loss. 


* * * * * 


(g) 

Debt instruments issued in exchange for property. 

If a 
debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the amount 
realized attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price 
of the debt instrument as determined under  1.1273-2 or 
 1.1274-2(b), whichever is applicable. If, however, the issue 
price of the debt instrument is determined under section 
1273(b)(4), the amount realized attributable to the debt 
instrument is its stated principal amount reduced by any unstated 
interest (as determined under section 483). This paragraph (g) 
applies to sales or exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. 
Taxpayers, however, may rely on this paragraph (g) 
for sales and exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and 
before April 4, 1994. 



Par. 8. 

In  1.1012-1, paragraph (f) is amended by removing 
the last sentence and paragraph (g) is added to read as follows: 


 1.1012-1 

Basis of property. 


* * * * * 


(g) 

Debt instruments issued in exchange for property. 

For 
purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, if a debt instrument 
is issued in exchange for property, the cost of the property that 
is attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price of the 
debt instrument as determined under  1.1273-2 or  1.1274-2(b), 
whichever is applicable. If, however, the issue price of the 
debt instrument is determined under section 1273(b)(4), the cost 
of the property attributable to the debt instrument is its stated 
principal amount reduced by any unstated interest (as determined 
under section 483). This paragraph (g) applies to sales or 
exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this paragraph (g) for sales and 
exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.

 1.1271-1 

Special rules applicable to amounts received on 
retirement, sale, or exchange of debt instruments. 


(a) 

Intention to call before maturity

_(1) 

In general

. For 
purposes of section 1271(a)(2), all or a portion of gain realized 
on a sale or exchange of a debt instrument to which section 1271 
applies is treated as interest income if there was an intention 
to call the debt instrument before maturity. An intention to 
call a debt instrument before maturity means a written or oral 
agreement or understanding not provided for in the debt 
instrument between the issuer and the original holder of the debt 
instrument that the issuer will redeem the debt instrument before 
maturity. In the case of debt instruments that are part of an 
issue, the agreement or understanding must be between the issuer 
and the original holders of a substantial amount of the debt 
instruments in the issue. An intention to call before maturity 
can exist even if the intention is conditional (e.g., the 
issuer's decision to call depends on the financial condition of 
the issuer on the potential call date) or is not legally binding. 
For purposes of this section, original holder means the first 
holder (other than an underwriter or dealer that purchased the 
debt instrument for resale in the ordinary course of its trade or 
business). 
(2) 

Exceptions

. In addition to the exceptions provided in 
sections 1271(a)(2)(B) and 1271(b), section 1271(a)(2) does not 
apply to_

(i) A debt instrument that is publicly offered (as defined 
in  1.1275-1(h)); 
(ii) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies 
(relating to certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, 
and certain other debt instruments with payments subject to 
acceleration); or 
(iii) A debt instrument sold pursuant to a private placement 
memorandum that is distributed to more than ten offerees and that 
is subject to the sanctions of section 12(2) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77l) or the prohibitions of section 10(b) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j). 
(b) 

Short-term obligations

_(1) 

In general

. Under sections 
1271(a)(3) and (a)(4), all or a portion of the gain realized on 
the sale or exchange of a short-term government or nongovernment 
obligation is treated as interest income. Sections 1271(a)(3) 
and (a)(4), however, do not apply to any short-term obligation 
subject to section 1281. See  1.1272-1(f) for rules to 
determine if an obligation is a short-term obligation. 
(2) 

Method of making elections

. Elections to accrue on a 
constant yield basis under sections 1271(a)(3)(E) and (a)(4)(D) 
are made on an obligation-by-obligation basis by reporting the 
transaction on the basis of daily compounding on the taxpayer's 
timely filed Federal income tax return for the year of the sale 
or exchange. These elections are irrevocable. 
(3) 

Counting conventions

. In computing the ratable share of 
acquisition discount under section 1271(a)(3) or OID under 
section 1271(a)(4), any reasonable counting convention may be 
used (e.g., 30 days per month/360 days per year). 



 1.1272-1

Current inclusion of OID in income. 


(a) 

Overview

_(1) 

In general

. Under section 1272(a)(1), a 
holder of a debt instrument includes accrued OID in gross income 
(as interest), regardless of the holder's regular method of 
accounting. A holder includes qualified stated interest (as 
defined in  1.1273-1(c)) in income under the holder's regular 
method of accounting. See   1.446-2 and 1.451-1. 
(2) 

Debt instruments not subject to OID inclusion rules.

 
Sections 1272(a)(2) and 1272(c) list exceptions to the general 
inclusion rule of section 1272(a)(1). For purposes of section 
1272(a)(2)(E) (relating to certain loans between natural 
persons), a loan does not include a stripped bond or stripped 
coupon within the meaning of section 1286(e), and the rule in 
section 1272(a)(2)(E)(iii), which treats a husband and wife as 1 
person, does not apply to loans made between a husband and wife. 
(b) 

Accrual of OID

_(1) 

Constant yield method

. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the 
amount of OID includible in the income of a holder of a debt 
instrument for any taxable year is determined using the constant 
yield method as described under this paragraph (b)(1). 
(i) 

Step one: Determine the debt instrument's yield to 
maturity.

 The yield to maturity or yield of a debt instrument is 
the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value 
of all principal and interest payments to be made under the debt 
instrument, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the 
debt instrument. The yield must be constant over the term of the 
debt instrument and, when expressed as a percentage, must be 
calculated to at least two decimal places. See paragraph (c) of 
this section for rules relating to the yield of certain debt 
instruments subject to contingencies.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Step two: Determine the accrual periods. 

An accrual 
period is an interval of time over which the accrual of OID is 
measured. Accrual periods may be of any length and may vary in 
length over the term of the debt instrument, provided that each 
accrual period is no longer than 1 year and each scheduled 
payment of principal or interest occurs either on the final day 
of an accrual period or on the first day of an accrual period. 
In general, the computation of OID is simplest if accrual periods 
correspond to the intervals between payment dates provided by the 
terms of the debt instrument. In computing the length of accrual 
periods, any reasonable counting convention may be used (e.g., 30 
days per month/360 days per year). 

(iii) 

Step three: Determine the OID allocable to each 
accrual period. 

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, the OID allocable to an accrual period equals the 
product of the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument (as 
defined in  1.1275-1(b)) at the beginning of the accrual period 
and the yield of the debt instrument, less the amount of any 
qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. In 
performing this calculation, the yield must be stated 
appropriately taking into account the length of the particular 
accrual period. 

Example 1

 in paragraph (j) of this section 
provides a formula for converting a yield based upon an accrual 
period of one length to an equivalent yield based upon an accrual 
period of a different length. 

(iv) 

Step four: Determine the daily portions of OID. 

The 
daily portions of OID are determined by allocating to each day in 
an accrual period the ratable portion of the OID allocable to the 
accrual period. The holder of the debt instrument includes in 
income the daily portions of OID for each day during the taxable 
year on which the holder held the debt instrument. 

(2) 

Exceptions. 

Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not 
apply to_

(i) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies 
(certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain 
other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration); 

(ii) A debt instrument that provides for contingent 
payments, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or 
in regulations under section 1275(d); or 

(iii) A variable rate debt instrument to which  1.1275-5 
applies, except as provided in  1.1275-5. 

(3) 

Modifications. 

The amount of OID includible in income 
by a holder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is adjusted 
if_

(i) The holder purchased the debt instrument at a premium or 
an acquisition premium (within the meaning of  1.1272-2); or 

(ii) The holder made an election for the debt instrument 
under  1.1272-3 to treat all interest as OID. 

(4) 

Special rules for determining the OID allocable to an 
accrual period. 

The following rules apply to determine the OID 
allocable to an accrual period under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. 

(i) 

Unpaid qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual 
period. 

In determining the OID allocable to an accrual period, 
if an interval between payments of qualified stated interest 
contains more than 1 accrual period_

(A) The amount of qualified stated interest payable at the 
end of the interval (including any qualified stated interest that 
is payable on the first day of the accrual period immediately 
following the interval) is allocated on a pro rata basis to each 
accrual period in the interval; and 

(B) The adjusted issue price at the beginning of each 
accrual period in the interval must be increased by the amount of 
any qualified stated interest that has accrued prior to the first 
day of the accrual period but that is not payable until the end 
of the interval. See 

Example 2

 of paragraph (j) of this section 
for an example illustrating the rules in this paragraph 
(b)(4)(i). 

(ii) 

Final accrual period. 

The OID allocable to the final 
accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at 
maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and 
the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual 
period. 

(iii) 

Initial short accrual period. 

If all accrual periods 
are of equal length, except for either an initial shorter accrual 
period or an initial and a final shorter accrual period, the 
amount of OID allocable to the initial accrual period may be 
computed using any reasonable method. See 

Example 3

 in paragraph 
(j) of this section. 

(iv) 

Payment on first day of an accrual period. 

The 
adjusted issue price at the beginning of an accrual period is 
reduced by the amount of any payment (other than a payment of 
qualified stated interest) that is made on the first day of the 
accrual period. 

(c) 

Yield and maturity of certain debt instruments subject 
to contingencies_

(1) 

Applicability. 

This paragraph (c) provides 
rules to determine the yield and maturity of a debt instrument 
that provides for an alternative payment schedule (or schedules) 
applicable upon the occurrence of a contingency (or 
contingencies). This paragraph (c) applies, however, only if the 
timing and amounts of the payments that comprise each payment 
schedule are known as of the issue date. A debt instrument does 
not provide for an alternative payment schedule merely because 
there is a possibility of impairment of a payment (or payments) 
by insolvency, default, or similar circumstances. See 
regulations under section 1275(d) for the treatment of debt 
instruments with payments that are otherwise contingent as to 
timing or amount. See  1.1273-1(c) to determine whether stated 
interest on a debt instrument subject to this paragraph (c) is 
qualified stated interest. 

(2) 

General rule. 

In general, the yield and maturity of a 
debt instrument subject to this paragraph (c) are determined by 
assuming that the payments will be made according to the 
instrument's stated payment schedule.

<TEXT>
 

(3) 

Contingencies that are likely to occur

_(i) 

Contingency taken into account. 

Notwithstanding the rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if, based on all the facts and circumstances as of the
issue date, it is more likely than not that the debt instrument's stated payment schedule will not occur, then the yield
and maturity of the debt instrument are computed based on the payment schedule most likely to occur. 
(ii) 

Mandatory sinking fund provision. 

Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to a mandatory sinking fund provision if the use and terms of the
provision meet reasonable commercial standards. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a mandatory sinking fund
provision is a provision that requires the issuer to redeem a certain amount of debt instruments in an issue prior to
maturity, provided that the debt instruments actually redeemed are chosen by lot or purchased by the issuer either
in the open market or pursuant to an offer made to all holders (with any proration determined by lot), and provided that
on the issue date the specific debt instruments that will be redeemed on any date prior to maturity cannot be identified.

(4) 

Consistency rule. 

The payment schedule determined by the issuer under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section is binding on all
holders of the debt instrument. However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder that explicitly discloses
that its determination of the yield and maturity of the debt instrument is different from the issuer's determination.
Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's
timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument.
See  1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders.

(5) 

Treatment of certain options. 

Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, the rules of this paragraph (c)(5) determine the yield
and maturity of a debt instrument that provides the holder or issuer with an unconditional option or options, exercisable
on one or more dates during the term of the debt instrument, that, if exercised, require payments to be made on the debt
instrument under an alternative payment schedule or schedules (e.g., an option to extend or an option to call a debt
instrument at a fixed premium). Under this paragraph (c)(5), an issuer will be deemed to exercise or not exercise an
option or combination of options in a manner that minimizes the yield on the debt instrument, and a holder will be deemed
to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that maximizes the yield on the debt instrument.
If both the issuer and the holder have options, the rules of this paragraph (c)(5) are applied to the options in the order
that they may be exercised. Thus, the deemed exercise of one option may eliminate other options that are later in time.
See 

Example 5 

through 

Example 8 

in paragraph (j) of this section. 
(6) 

Subsequent adjustments. 

If a contingency described in this paragraph (c) (including the exercise of an option described in paragraph (c)(5)
of this section) actually occurs or does not occur, contrary to the assumption made pursuant to this paragraph (c)
(a change in circumstances), then, solely for purposes of the accrual of OID, the yield and maturity of the debt instrument
are redetermined by treating the debt instrument as reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount
equal to its adjusted issue price on that date. See 

Example 5

 and 

Example 7 

in paragraph (j) of this section. If, however, the change in circumstances results in a substantially contemporaneous
pro rata prepayment as defined in  1.1275-2(f)(2) (e.g., because a partial put or call option treated
under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as not exercised is, in fact, exercised), the pro rata prepayment is treated
as a payment in retirement of a portion of the debt instrument, which may result in gain or loss to the holder. See 

Example 6

 and 

Example 8

 in paragraph (j) of this section. 
(d) 

Certain debt instruments that provide for principal payments uncertain as to time.

 The yield of a debt instrument with principal payments that are fixed in total amount but that are uncertain as to time
(such as a demand loan) is the stated interest rate if the issue price of the instrument is equal to the stated principal
amount and interest is paid or compounded at a fixed rate over the entire term of the debt instrument at intervals of
1 year or less.

<TEXT>
 

(e) 

Convertible debt instruments.

 For purposes of section 
1272, an option is ignored if it is an option to convert a debt 
instrument into the stock of the issuer, into the stock or debt 
of a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 
707(b)(1)), or into cash or other property in an amount equal to 
the approximate value of such stock or debt. 

(f) 

Special rules to determine whether a debt instrument is 
a short-term obligation

_(1) 

Counting of either the issue date or 
maturity date.

 For purposes of determining whether a debt 
instrument is a short-term obligation (i.e., a debt instrument 
with a fixed maturity date that is not more than 1 year from the 
date of issue), the term of the debt instrument includes either 
the issue date or the maturity date, but not both dates. 

(2) 

Coordination with paragraph (c) of this section for 
certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code.

 Notwithstanding 
paragraph (c) of this section, solely for purposes of determining 
whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation under 
sections 871(g)(1)(B)(i), 881, 1271(a)(3), 1271(a)(4), 
1272(a)(2)(C), and 1283(a)(1), the maturity date of a debt 
instrument is the last possible date that the instrument could be 
outstanding under the terms of the instrument. 

(g) 

Basis adjustment.

 The basis of a debt instrument in the 
hands of the holder is increased by the amount of OID included in 
the holder's gross income and decreased by the amount of any 
payment from the issuer to the holder under the debt instrument 
other than a payment of qualified stated interest. See, however, 
 1.1275-2(f) for rules regarding basis adjustments on a pro rata 
prepayment. 

(h) 

Debt instruments denominated in a currency other than 
the U.S. dollar.

 Section 1272 and this section apply to a debt 
instrument that provides for all payments denominated in, or 
determined by reference to, the functional currency of the 
taxpayer or qualified business unit of the taxpayer (even if that 
currency is other than the U.S. dollar). See  1.988-2(b) to 
determine interest income or expense for debt instruments that 
provide for payments denominated in, or determined by reference 
to, a nonfunctional currency. 

(i) [Reserved] 

(j) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section. Each example assumes that all taxpayers use the 
calendar year as the taxable year. In addition, each example 
assumes a 30-day month, 360-day year, and that the initial 
accrual period begins on the issue date and the final accrual 
period ends on the day before the stated maturity date. 
Although, for purposes of simplicity, the yield as stated is 
rounded to two decimal places, the computations do not reflect 
any such rounding convention. 






Example 1. Accrual of OID on zero coupon debt instrument; 
choice of accrual periods

_(i) 

Facts.

 On July 1, 1994, A 
purchases at original issue, for $675,564.17, a debt instrument 
that matures on July 1, 1999, and provides for a single payment 
of $1,000,000 at maturity. 

(ii) 

Determination of yield.

 Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section, the yield of the debt instrument is 8 percent, 
compounded semiannually. 

(iii) 

Determination of accrual period.

 Under paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, accrual periods may be of any length, 
provided that each accrual period is no longer than 1 year and 
each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on 
the first or final day of an accrual period. The yield to 
maturity to be used in computing OID accruals in any accrual 
period, however, must reflect the length of the accrual period 
chosen. A yield based on compounding b times per year is 
equivalent to a yield based on compounding c times per year as 
indicated by the following formula: 



r=c

m

(1+i/b) 

b/c

^1

n

 




In which: 




i=The yield based on compounding b times per year 
expressed as a decimal 

r=The equivalent yield based on compounding c times 
per year expressed as a decimal 

b=The number of compounding periods in a year on 
which i is based (for example, 12, if i is based 
on monthly compounding) 

c=The number of compounding periods in a year on 
which r is based 




(iv) 

Determination of OID allocable to each accrual period. 


Assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using 
semiannual accrual periods. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, the OID allocable to the first semiannual accrual period 
is $27,022.56: the product of the issue price ($675,564.17) and 
the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period 
(8 percent/2), less qualified stated interest allocable to the 
accrual period ($0). The daily portion of OID for the first 
semiannual accrual period is $150.13 ($27,022.56/180). 

(v) 

Determination of OID if monthly accrual periods are 
used.

 Alternatively, assume that A decides to compute OID on the 
debt instrument using monthly accrual periods. Using the above 
formula, the yield on the debt instrument reflecting monthly 
compounding is 7.87 percent, compounded monthly (12

m

(1+.08/2)

2/12

^1

n

). Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, 
the OID allocable to the first monthly accrual period is 
$4,430.48: the product of the issue price ($675,564.17) and the 
yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period 
(7.87 percent/12), less qualified stated interest allocable to 
the accrual period ($0). The daily portion of OID for the first 
monthly accrual period is $147.68 ($4,430.48/30).

Example 2.

 

Accrual of OID on debt instrument with qualified 
stated interest

_(i) 

Facts.

 On September 1, 1994, A purchases at 
original issue, for $90,000, B corporation's debt instrument that 
matures on September 1, 2004, and has a stated principal amount 
of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides 
for semiannual payments of interest of $3,000, payable on 
September 1 and March 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 1995. 

(ii) 

Determination of yield.

 The debt instrument is a 10-year debt instrument with an issue price of $90,000 and a stated 
redemption price at maturity of $100,000. The semiannual 
payments of $3,000 are qualified stated interest payments. Under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield is 7.44 percent, 
compounded semiannually. 

(iii) 

Accrual of OID if semiannual accrual periods are used.

 
Assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using 
semiannual accrual periods. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, the OID allocable to the first semiannual accrual period 
equals the product of the issue price ($90,000) and the yield 
properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.44 
percent/2), less qualified stated interest allocable to the 
accrual period ($3,000). Therefore, the amount of OID for the 
first semiannual accrual period is $345.78 ($3,345.78-$3,000). 

(iv) 

Adjustment for accrued but unpaid qualified stated 
interest if monthly accrual periods are used.

 Assume, 
alternatively, that A decides to compute OID on the debt 
instrument using monthly accrual periods. The yield, compounded 
monthly, is 7.32 percent. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, the OID allocable to the first monthly accrual period is 
the product of the issue price ($90,000) and the yield properly 
adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.32 percent/12), 
less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. 
Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the qualified 
stated interest allocable to the first monthly accrual period is 
the pro rata amount of qualified stated interest allocable to the 
interval between payment dates ($3,000 x 1/6, or $500). 
Therefore, the amount of OID for the first monthly accrual period 
is $49.18 ($549.18-$500). Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this 
section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument for 
purposes of determining the amount of OID for the second monthly 
accrual period is $90,549.18 ($90,000 + $49.18 + $500). Although 
the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument for this purpose 
includes the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to the 
first monthly accrual period, A includes the qualified stated 
interest in income based on A's regular method of accounting 
(e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements 
method). 



Example 3.

 

Accrual of OID for debt instrument with initial 
short accrual period

_(i) 

Facts.

 On May 1, 1994, G purchases at 
original issue, for $80,000, H corporation's debt instrument 
maturing on July 1, 2004. The debt instrument provides for a 
single payment at maturity of $250,000. G computes its OID using 
6-month accrual periods ending on January 1 and July 1 of each 
year and an initial short 2-month accrual period from May 1, 
1994, through June 30, 1994. 

(ii) 

Determination of yield.

 The yield on the debt 
instrument is 11.53 percent, compounded semiannually. 

(iii) 

Determination of OID allocable to initial short 
accrual period.

 Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, G 
may use any reasonable method to compute OID for the initial 
short accrual period. One reasonable method is to calculate the 
amount of OID pursuant to the following formula: 




OID

short

=IP x (i/k) x f 




In which: 




OID

short

=The amount of OID allocable to the initial short 
accrual period 

IP=The issue price of the debt instrument 

i=The yield to maturity expressed as a decimal 

k=The number of accrual periods in a year 

f=A fraction whose numerator is the number of days 
in the initial short accrual period, and whose 
denominator is the number of days in a full 
accrual period 




(iv) 

Amount of OID for the initial short accrual period.

 
Under this method, the amount of OID for the initial short 
accrual period is $1,537 ($80,000 x (11.53 percent/2)  x  
(60/180)). 

(v) 

Alternative method.

 Another reasonable method is to 
calculate the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period 
using the yield based on bi-monthly compounding, computed 
pursuant to the formula set forth in 

Example 1

 of paragraph (j) 
of this section. Under this method, the amount of OID for the 
initial short accrual period is $1,508.38 ($80,000 x (11.31 
percent/6)). 



Example 4.

 

Impermissible accrual of OID using a method 
other than constant yield method

_(i) 

Facts.

 On July 1, 1994, B 
purchases at original issue, for $100,000, C corporation's debt 
instrument that matures on July 1, 1999, and has a stated 
principal amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for a 
single payment at maturity of $148,024.43. The yield of the debt 
instrument is 8 percent, compounded semiannually. 

(ii) 

Determination of yield.

 Assume that C uses 6 monthly 
accrual periods to compute its OID for 1994. The yield must 
reflect monthly compounding (as determined using the formula 
described in 

Example 1

 of paragraph (j) of this section). As a 
result, the monthly yield of the debt instrument is 7.87 percent, 
divided by 12. C may not compute its monthly yield for the last 
6 months in 1994 by dividing 8 percent by 12. 



Example 5.

 

Debt instrument subject to put option

_(i) 


Facts.

 On January 1, 1995, G purchases at original issue, for 
$70,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 
2010, with a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at 
maturity. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments 
of interest of $4,000, payable on January 1 and July 1 of each 
year, beginning on July 1, 1995. The debt instrument gives G an 
unconditional right to put the bond back to H, exercisable on 
January 1, 2005, in return for $85,000 (exclusive of the $4,000 
of stated interest payable on that date). 



(ii) 

Determination of yield and maturity. 

Yield determined 
without regard to the put option is 12.47 percent, compounded 
semiannually. Yield determined by assuming that the put option 
is exercised (i.e., by using January 1, 2005, as the maturity 
date and $85,000 as the stated principal amount payable on that 
date) is 12.56 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that G will 
exercise the put option, because exercise of the option would 
increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of 
calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 10-year 
debt instrument with an issue price of $70,000, a stated 
redemption price at maturity of $85,000, and a yield of 12.56 
percent, compounded semiannually. 

(iii) 

Consequences if put option is, in fact, not exercised. 


If the put option is, in fact, not exercised, then, under 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated, 
solely for purposes of determining yield and maturity, as if it 
were reissued on January 1, 2005, for an amount equal to its 
adjusted issue price on that date, $85,000. The new debt 
instrument matures on January 1, 2010, with a stated principal 
amount of $100,000 payable on that date and provides for 
semiannual payments of interest of $4,000. The yield of the new 
debt instrument is 12.08 percent, compounded semiannually. 


Example 6. 

Debt instrument subject to partial call 
option

_(i) 

Facts.

 On January 1, 1995, H purchases at original 
issue, for $95,000, J corporation's debt instrument that matures 
on January 1, 2000, and has a stated principal amount of 
$100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for 
semiannual payments of interest of $4,000, payable on January 1 
and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1995. On January 
1, 1998, J has an unconditional right to call 50 percent of the 
principal amount of the debt instrument for $55,000 (exclusive of 
the $4,000 of stated interest payable on that date). If the call 
is exercised, the semiannual payments of interest made after the 
call date will be reduced to $2,000.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Determination of yield and maturity. 

Yield determined 
without regard to the call option is 9.27 percent, compounded 
semiannually. Yield determined by assuming J exercises its call 
option is 10.75 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that J will not 
exercise the call option because exercise of the option would 
increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of 
calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year 
debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of 
$100,000, and a yield of 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. 


(iii) 

Consequences if the call option is, in fact, 
exercised. 

If the call option is, in fact, exercised, then under 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated 
as if the issuer made a pro rata prepayment of $55,000 that is 
subject to  1.1275-2(f). Consequently, under  1.1275-2(f)(1), 
the instrument is treated as consisting of two debt instruments, 
one that is retired on the call date and one that remains 
outstanding after the call date. The adjusted issue price, 
adjusted basis in the hands of the holder, and accrued OID of the 
original debt instrument is allocated between the two instruments 
based on the portion of the original instrument treated as 
retired. Since each payment remaining to be made after the call 
date is reduced by one-half, one-half of the adjusted issue 
price, adjusted basis, and accrued OID is allocated to the debt 
instrument that is treated as retired. The adjusted issue price 
of the original debt instrument immediately prior to the call 
date is $97,725.12, which equals the issue price of the original 
debt instrument ($95,000) increased by the OID previously 
includible in gross income ($2,725.12). One-half of this 
adjusted issue price is allocated to the debt instrument treated 
as retired, and the other half is allocated to the debt 
instrument that is treated as remaining outstanding. Thus, the 
debt instrument treated as remaining outstanding has an adjusted 
issue price immediately after the call date of $97,725.12/2, or 
$48,862.56. The yield of this debt instrument continues to be 
9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. In addition, the portion 
of H's adjusted basis allocated to the debt instrument treated as 
retired is $97,725.12/2 or $48,862.56. Accordingly, under 
section 1271, H realizes a gain on the deemed retirement equal to 
$6,137.44 ($55,000 ^ $48,862.56). 




Example 7. Debt instrument issued at par that provides for 
payment of interest in kind_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, A 
purchases at original issue, for $100,000, X corporation's debt 
instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a stated principal 
amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument 
provides for annual payments of interest of $6,000 on January 1 
of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The debt instrument 
gives X the unconditional right to issue, in lieu of the first 
interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK instrument) 
maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal amount of 
$6,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide for annual 
payments of interest of $360 on January 1 of each year, beginning 
on January 1, 1997. 





(ii) 

Aggregation of PIK instrument with original debt 
instrument. 

Under  1.1275-2(c)(3), the issuance of the PIK 
instrument is not considered a payment made on the original debt 
instrument, and the PIK instrument is aggregated with the 
original debt instrument. The issue date of the PIK instrument 
is the same as the original debt instrument. 

(iii) 

Determination of yield and maturity. 

The right to 
issue the PIK instrument is treated as an option to defer the 
initial interest payment until maturity. Yield determined without regard to the option is 6 percent, compounded
annually, Yield determined by assuming X exercises the option is 6 percent, 
compounded annually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, it is assumed that X will not exercise the option by 
issuing the PIK instrument because exercise of the option would 
not decrease the yield of the debt instrument. For purposes of 
calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year 
debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of 
$100,000 and ten semiannual interest payments of $6,000, 
beginning on January 1, 1996. As a result, the debt instrument's 
yield is 6 percent, compounded annually. 

(iv) 

Determination of OID. 

Under the payment schedule that 
would result if the option was exercised, none of the interest on 
the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest. 
Accordingly, under  1.1273-1(c)(2), no payments on the debt 
instrument are qualified stated interest payments. Thus, $6,000 
of OID accrues during the first annual accrual period. If the 
PIK instrument is not issued, $6,000 of OID accrues during each 
annual accrual period. 


(v) 

Consequences if the PIK instrument is issued. 

Under 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if X issues the PIK instrument 
on January 1, 1996, the issuance of the PIK instrument is not a 
payment on the debt instrument. Solely for purposes of 
determining yield and maturity, the debt instrument is deemed 
reissued on January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $106,000. The 
recomputed yield is 6 percent, compounded annually. The OID for 
the first annual accrual period after the deemed reissuance is 
$6,360. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument at the 
beginning of the next annual accrual period is $106,000 ($106,000 
+ $6,360 ^ $6,360). The OID for each of the four remaining 
annual accrual periods is $6,360. 



Example 8. Debt instrument issued at a discount that 
provides for payment of interest in kind_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 
1, 1995, T purchases at original issue, for $75,500, U 
corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a 
stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The 
debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of 
$4,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. 
The debt instrument gives U the unconditional right to issue, in 
lieu of the first interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK 
instrument) maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal 
amount of $4,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide 
for annual payments of interest of $160 on January 1 of each 
year, beginning on January 1, 1997.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Aggregation of PIK instrument with original debt 
instrument. 

Under  1.1275-2(c)(3), the issuance of the PIK 
instrument is not considered a payment made on the original debt 
instrument, and the PIK instrument is aggregated with the 
original debt instrument. The issue date of the PIK instrument 
is the same as the original debt instrument. 

(iii) 

Determination of yield and maturity. 

The right to 
issue the PIK instrument is treated as an option to defer the 
initial interest payment until maturity. Yield determined 
without regard to the option is 10.55 percent, compounded 
annually. Yield determined by assuming U exercises the option is 
10.32 percent, compounded annually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) 
of this section, it is assumed that U will exercise the option by 
issuing the PIK instrument because exercise of the option would 
decrease the yield of the debt instrument. For purposes of 
calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year 
debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of 
$104,000 and four annual interest payments of $4,160, beginning 
on January 1, 1997. As a result, the yield is 10.32 percent, 
compounded annually. 

(iv) 

Consequences if the PIK instrument is not issued. 


Assume that T chooses to compute OID accruals on the basis of an 
annual accrual period. On January 1, 1996, the adjusted issue 
price of the debt instrument, and T's adjusted basis in the 
instrument, is $83,295.15. Under paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section, if U actually makes the $4,000 interest payment on 
January 1, 1996, the debt instrument is treated as if U made a 
pro rata prepayment (within the meaning of  1.1275-2(f)(2)) of 
$4,000, which reduces the amount of each payment remaining on the 
instrument by a factor of 4/104, or 1/26. Thus, under  1.1275-2(f)(1) and section 1271, T realizes a gain
of $796.34 ($4,000 ^
($83,295.15/26)). The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument 
and T's adjusted basis immediately after the payment is 
$80,091.49 ($83,295.15  x  25/26) and the yield continues to be 
10.32 percent, compounded annually. 



Example 9. Debt instrument with stepped interest rate_

(i) 


Facts. 

On July 1, 1994, G purchases at original issue, for 
$85,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on July 1, 
2004. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of 
$100,000, payable on the maturity date and provides for 
semiannual interest payments on January 1 and July 1 of each 
year, beginning on January 1, 1995. The amount of each payment 
is $2,000 for the first 5 years and $5,000 for the final 5 years. 

(ii) 

Determination of OID. 

Assume that G computes its OID 
using 6-month accrual periods ending on January 1 and July 1 of 
each year. The yield of the debt instrument, determined under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, is 8.65 percent, compounded 
semiannually. Interest is unconditionally payable at a fixed 
rate of at least 4 percent, compounded semiannually, for the 
entire term of the debt instrument. Consequently, under 
 1.1273-1(c)(1), the semiannual payments are qualified stated 
interest payments to the extent of $2,000. The amount of OID for 
the first 6-month accrual period is $1,674.34 (the issue price of 
the debt instrument ($85,000) times the yield of the debt 
instrument for that accrual period (.0865/2) less the amount of 
any qualified stated interest allocable to that accrual period 
($2,000)). 



Example 10. Debt instrument payable on demand that provides 
for interest at a constant rate_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, 
V purchases at original issue, for $100,000, W corporation's debt 
instrument. The debt instrument calls for interest to accrue at 
a rate of 9 percent, compounded annually. The debt instrument is 
redeemable at any time at the option of V for an amount equal to 
$100,000, plus accrued interest. V uses annual accrual periods 
to accrue OID on the debt instrument. 

(ii) 

Amount of OID. 

Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, the yield of the debt instrument is 9 percent, 
compounded annually. If the debt instrument is not redeemed 
during 1995, the amount of OID allocable to the year is $9,000. 



 1.1272-2 

Treatment of debt instruments purchased at a premium. 



(a) 

In general. 

Under section 1272(c)(1), if a holder 
purchases a debt instrument at a premium, the holder does not 
include any OID in gross income. Under section 1272(a)(7), if a 
holder purchases a debt instrument at an acquisition premium, the 
holder reduces the amount of OID includible in gross income by 
the fraction determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 

(b) 

Definitions and special rules_

(1) 

Purchase. 

For 
purposes of section 1272 and this section, purchase means any 
acquisition of a debt instrument, including the acquisition of a 
newly issued debt instrument in a debt-for-debt exchange or the 
acquisition of a debt instrument from a donor. 

(2) 

Premium. 

A debt instrument is purchased at a premium if 
its adjusted basis, immediately after its purchase by the holder 
(including a purchase at original issue), exceeds the sum of all 
amounts payable on the instrument after the purchase date other 
than payments of qualified stated interest (as defined in 
 1.1273-1(c)). 

(3) 

Acquisition premium. 

A debt instrument is purchased at 
an acquisition premium if its adjusted basis, immediately after 
its purchase (including a purchase at original issue), is_

(i) Less than or equal to the sum of all amounts payable on 
the instrument after the purchase date other than payments of 
qualified stated interest (as defined in  1.1273-1(c)); and 

(ii) Greater than the instrument's adjusted issue price (as 
defined in  1.1275-1(b)). 

(4) 

Acquisition premium fraction. 

In applying section 
1272(a)(7), the cost of a debt instrument is its adjusted basis 
immediately after its acquisition by the purchaser. Thus, the 
numerator of the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7)(B) 
is the excess of the adjusted basis of the debt instrument 
immediately after its acquisition by the purchaser over the 
adjusted issue price of the debt instrument. The denominator of 
the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7)(B) is the excess 
of the sum of all amounts payable on the debt instrument after 
the purchase date, other than payments of qualified stated 
interest, over the instrument's adjusted issue price. 

(5) 

Election to accrue discount on a constant yield basis. 


Rather than applying the acquisition premium fraction, a holder 
of a debt instrument purchased at an acquisition premium may 
elect under  1.1272-3 to compute OID accruals by treating the 
purchase as a purchase at original issuance and applying the 
mechanics of the constant yield method.

(6) 

Special rules for determining basis

_(i) 

Debt instruments acquired in exchange for other property. 

For purposes of section 1272(a)(7), section 1272(c)(1), and this section, if a debt instrument is acquired in an exchange
for other property (other than in a reorganization defined in section 368) and the basis of the debt instrument is determined,
in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the other property, the basis of the debt instrument may not exceed its
fair market value immediately after the exchange. For example, if a debt instrument is distributed by a partnership
to a partner in a liquidating distribution and the partner's basis in the debt instrument would otherwise be determined
under section 732, the partner's basis in the debt instrument may not exceed its fair market value for purposes of this
section. 
(ii) 

Acquisition by gift. 

For purposes of this section, a donee's adjusted basis in a debt instrument is the donee's basis for determining gain
under section 1015(a). 
(c) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. 





Example 1. Debt instrument purchased at an acquisition premium

_(i) 

Facts. 

On July 1, 1994, A purchased at original issue, for $500, a debt instrument issued by Corporation X. The debt instrument
matures on July 1, 1999, and calls for a single payment at maturity of $1,000. Under section 1273(a), the debt instrument
has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 and, thus, OID of $500. On July 1, 1996, when the debt instrument's
adjusted issue price is $659.75, A sells the debt instrument to B for $750 in cash. 
(ii) 

Acquisition premium fraction. 

Because the cost to B of the debt instrument is less than the amount payable on the debt instrument after the purchase
date, but is greater than the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, B has paid an acquisition premium for the debt
instrument. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID for any day that B holds the debt instrument is reduced by a fraction,
the numerator of which is $90.25 (the excess of the cost of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price) and the
denominator of which is $340.25 (the excess of the sum of all payments after the purchase date over its adjusted issue
price). 


Example 2. Debt-for-debt exchange where holder is considered to purchase new debt instrument at a premium

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, H purchases at original issue, for $1,000, a debt instrument issued by Corporation X. On July 1,
1997, when H's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,000, Corporation X issues a new debt instrument with a stated
redemption price at maturity of $750 to H in exchange for the old debt instrument. Assume that the issue price of the
new debt instrument is $600. Thus, under section 1273(a), the debt instrument has OID of $150. The exchange qualifies
as a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E), with the consequence that, under sections 354 and 358, H recognizes
no loss on the exchange and has an adjusted basis in the new debt instrument of $1,000. 
(ii) 

Application of section 1272(c)(1). 

Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, H purchases the new debt instrument at a premium of $250. Accordingly,
under section 1272(c)(1), H is not required to include OID in income with respect to the new debt instrument. 


Example 3. Debt-for-debt exchange where holder is considered to purchase new debt instrument at an acquisition premium

_(i) 

Facts.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 2 

of paragraph (c) of this section, except that H purchases the old debt instrument from another holder on July 1, 1995,
and on July 1, 1997, H's adjusted basis in the old debt instrument is $700. Under section 1273(a), the new debt instrument
is issued with OID of $150. 
(ii) 

Application of section 1272(a)(7). 

Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section, H purchases the new debt instrument at an acquisition premium
of $100. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID that is includible in H's income is reduced by the fraction determined
under section 1272(a)(7). 


Example 4. Treatment of acquisition premium for debt instrument acquired by gift

_(i) 

Facts. 

On July 1, 1994, D receives as a gift a debt instrument with a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 and an adjusted
issue price of $800. On that date, the fair market value of the debt instrument is $900 and the donor's adjusted basis
in the debt instrument is $950. 
(ii) 

Application of section 1272(a)(7). 

Under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(6)(ii) of this section, D is considered to have purchased the debt instrument
at an acquisition premium of $150. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID that is includible in D's income is reduced
by the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7).

 1.1272-3



Election by a holder to treat all interest on a debt 
instrument as OID. 



(a) 

Election

. A holder of a debt instrument may elect to 
include in gross income all interest that accrues on the 
instrument by using the constant yield method described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this election, 
interest includes stated interest, acquisition discount, OID, de 
minimis OID, market discount, de minimis market discount, and 
unstated interest, as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or 
acquisition premium. 
(b) 

Scope of election

_(1) 

In general

. Except as provided 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a holder may make the 
election for any debt instrument. 
(2) 

Exceptions, limitations, and special rules

_(i) 

Debt 
instrument with amortizable bond premium (as determined under 
section 171)

. (A) A holder may make the election for a debt 
instrument with amortizable bond premium only if the instrument 
qualifies as a bond under section 171(d). 
(B) If a holder makes the election under this section for a 
debt instrument with amortizable bond premium, the holder is 
deemed to have made the election under section 171(c)(2) for the 
taxable year in which the instrument was acquired. If the holder 
has previously made the election under section 171(c)(2), the 
requirements of that election with respect to any debt instrument 
are satisfied by electing to amortize the bond premium under the 
rules provided by this section. 
(ii) 

Debt instrument with market discount

. (A) A holder may 
make the election under this section for a debt instrument with 
market discount only if the holder is eligible to make an 
election under section 1278(b). 
(B) If a holder makes the election under this section for a 
debt instrument with market discount, the holder is deemed to 
have made both the election under section 1276(b)(2) for that 
instrument and the election under section 1278(b) for the taxable 
year in which the instrument was acquired. If the holder has 
previously made the election under section 1278(b), the 
requirements of that election with respect to any debt instrument 
are satisfied by electing to include the market discount in 
income in accordance with the rules provided by this section. 
(iii) 

Tax-exempt debt instrument

. A holder may not make the 
election for a tax-exempt obligation as defined in section 
1275(a)(3). 
(c) 

Mechanics of the constant yield method

_(1) 

In general

. 
For purposes of this section, the amount of interest that accrues 
during an accrual period is determined under rules similar to 
those under section 1272 (the constant yield method). In 
applying the constant yield method, however, a debt instrument 
subject to the election is treated as if_

(i) The instrument is issued for the holder's adjusted basis immediately after its acquisition by the holder; 
(ii) The instrument is issued on the holder's acquisition 
date; and 
(iii) None of the interest payments provided for in the 
instrument are qualified stated interest payments. 
(2) 

Special rules to determine adjusted basis. 

For purposes 
of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section_

(i) If the debt instrument is acquired in an exchange for 
other property (other than in a reorganization defined in section 
368) and the basis of the debt instrument is determined, in whole 
or in part, by reference to the basis of the other property, the 
adjusted basis of the debt instrument may not exceed its fair 
market value immediately after the exchange; and 
(ii) If the debt instrument was acquired with amortizable 
bond premium (as determined under section 171), the adjusted 
basis of the debt instrument is reduced by an amount equal to the 
value attributable to any conversion feature. 
(d) 

Time and manner of making the election. 

The election 
must be made for the taxable year in which the holder acquires 
the debt instrument. A holder makes the election by attaching to 
the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return a statement 
that the holder is making an election under this section and that 
identifies the debt instruments subject to the election. A 
holder may make the election for a class or group of debt 
instruments by attaching a statement describing the type or types 
of debt instruments being designated for the election. 
(e) 

Revocation of election. 

The election may not be revoked 
unless approved by the Commissioner. 
(f) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to debt 
instruments acquired on or after April 4, 1994.

 1.1273-1



Definition of OID. 





(a) 

In general

. Section 1273(a)(1) defines OID as the 
excess of a debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity 
over its issue price. Section 1.1273-2 defines issue price, and 
paragraph (b) of this section defines stated redemption price at 
maturity. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for de 
minimis amounts of OID. Although the total amount of OID for a 
debt instrument may be indeterminate,  1.1272-1(d) provides a 
rule to determine OID accruals on certain debt instruments that 
provide for principal payments uncertain as to time. See 

Example 10 

in  1.1272-1(j). 
(b) 

Stated redemption price at maturity. 

A debt 
instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of 
all payments provided by the debt instrument other than qualified 
stated interest payments. If the payment schedule of a debt 
instrument is determined under  1.1272-1(c) (relating to certain 
debt instruments subject to contingencies), that payment schedule 
is used to determine the instrument's stated redemption price at 
maturity. 
(c) 

Qualified stated interest

_(1) 

Definition

_(i) 

In 
general

. Qualified stated interest is stated interest that is 
unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt 
instruments of the issuer), or that will be constructively 
received under section 451, at least annually at a single fixed 
rate (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section). 
(ii) 

Unconditionally payable. 

Interest is unconditionally 
payable only if late payment (other than a late payment that 
occurs within a reasonable grace period) or nonpayment is 
expected to be penalized or reasonable remedies exist to compel 
payment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, interest is not 
unconditionally payable if the lending transaction does not 
reflect arm's length dealing and the holder does not intend to 
enforce such remedies. For purposes of determining whether 
interest is unconditionally payable, the possibility of 
nonpayment due to default, insolvency, or similar circumstances, 
or due to the exercise of a conversion right described in 
 1.1272-1(e) is ignored. 
(iii) 

Single fixed rate

_(A) 

In general. 

Interest is 
payable at a single fixed rate only if the rate appropriately 
takes into account the length of the interval between payments. 
Thus, if the interval between payments varies during the term of 
the debt instrument, the value of the fixed rate on which a 
payment is based generally must be adjusted to reflect a 
compounding assumption that is consistent with the length of the 
interval preceding the payment. See 

Example 1 

in paragraph (f) 
of this section. 
(B) 

Special rule for certain first and final payment 
intervals. 

Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this 
section, if a debt instrument provides for payment intervals that 
are equal in length throughout the term of the instrument, except 
that the first or final payment interval differs in length from 
the other payment intervals, the first or final interest payment 
is considered to be made at a fixed rate if the value of the rate 
on which the payment is based is adjusted in any reasonable 
manner to take into account the length of the interval. See 


Example 2 

of paragraph (f) of this section. The rule in this 
paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) also applies if the lengths of both the 
first and final payment intervals differ from the length of the 
other payment intervals. 
(2) 

Debt instruments subject to contingencies. 

The 
determination of whether a debt instrument described in  1.1272-1(c) (a debt instrument providing for
an alternative payment 
schedule (or schedules) upon the occurrence of one or more 
contingencies) provides for qualified stated interest is made by 
analyzing each alternative payment schedule (including the stated 
payment schedule) as if it were the debt instrument's sole 
payment schedule. Under this analysis, the debt instrument 
provides for qualified stated interest to the extent of the 
lowest fixed rate at which qualified stated interest would be 
payable under any payment schedule. See 

Example (4) 

of paragraph 
(f) of this section. 
(3) 

Variable rate debt instrument. 

In the case of a 
variable rate debt instrument, qualified stated interest is 
determined under  1.1275-5(e). 
(4) 

Stated interest in excess of qualified stated interest

. 
To the extent that stated interest payable under a debt 
instrument exceeds qualified stated interest, the excess is 
included in the debt instrument's stated redemption price at 
maturity. 
(5) 

Short-term obligations. 

In the case of a debt 
instrument with a term that is not more than 1 year from the date 
of issue, no payments of interest are treated as qualified stated 
interest payments. 
(d) 

De minimis OID

_(1) 

In general

. If the amount of OID 
with respect to a debt instrument is less than the de minimis 
amount, the amount of OID is treated as zero, and all stated 
interest (including stated interest that would otherwise be 
characterized as OID) is treated as qualified stated interest. 
(2) 

De minimis amount

. The de minimis amount is an amount 
equal to 0.0025 multiplied by the product of the stated 
redemption price at maturity and the number of complete years to 
maturity from the issue date. 
(3) 

Installment obligations

. In the case of an installment 
obligation (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section is applied by substituting for 
the number of complete years to maturity the weighted average 
maturity (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section). 
Alternatively, in the case of a debt instrument that provides for 
payments of principal no more rapidly than a self-amortizing 
installment obligation (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section), the de minimis amount defined in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section may be calculated by substituting 0.00167 for 
0.0025.

(4) 

Special rule for interest holidays, teaser rates, and 
other interest shortfalls

_(i) 

In general. 

This paragraph (d)(4) 
provides a special rule to determine whether a debt instrument 
with a teaser rate (or rates), an interest holiday, or any other 
interest shortfall has de minimis OID. This rule applies if_

(A) The amount of OID on the debt instrument is more than 
the de minimis amount as otherwise determined under paragraph (d) 
of this section; and 

(B) All stated interest provided for in the debt instrument 
would be qualified stated interest under paragraph (c) of this 
section except that for 1 or more accrual periods the interest 
rate is below the rate applicable for the remainder of the 
instrument's term (e.g., if as a result of an interest holiday, 
none of the stated interest is qualified stated interest). 


(ii) 

Redetermination of OID for purposes of the de minimis 
test. 

For purposes of determining whether a debt instrument 
described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section has de minimis 
OID, the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is 
treated as equal to the instrument's issue price plus the greater 
of the amount of foregone interest or the excess (if any) of the 
instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price. The 
amount of foregone interest is the amount of additional stated 
interest that would be required to be payable on the debt 
instrument during the period of the teaser rate, holiday, or 
shortfall so that all stated interest would be qualified stated 
interest under paragraph (c) of this section. See 

Example 5

 and 


Example 6 

of paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, for 
purposes of computing the de minimis amount of OID, the weighted 
average maturity of the debt instrument is determined by treating 
all stated interest payments as qualified stated interest 
payments. 
(5) 

Treatment of de minimis OID by holders_

(i)

 Allocation 
of de minimis OID to principal payments. 

The holder of a debt 
instrument includes any de minimis OID (other than de minimis OID 
treated as qualified stated interest under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, such as de minimis OID attributable to a teaser 
rate or interest holiday) in income as stated principal payments 
are made. The amount includible in income with respect to each 
principal payment equals the product of the total amount of de 
minimis OID on the debt instrument and a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the amount of the principal payment made and the 
denominator of which is the stated principal amount of the 
instrument. 
(ii) 

Character of de minimis OID

_(A) 

De minimis OID treated 
as gain recognized on retirement. 

Any amount of de minimis OID 
includible in income under this paragraph (d)(5) is treated as 
gain recognized on retirement of the debt instrument. See 
section 1271 to determine whether a retirement is treated as an 
exchange of the debt instrument. 

(B) 

Treatment of de minimis OID on sale or exchange. 

Any 
gain attributable to de minimis OID that is recognized on the 
sale or exchange of a debt instrument is capital gain if the debt 
instrument is a capital asset in the hands of the seller. 

(iii) 

Treatment of subsequent holders. 

If a subsequent 
holder purchases a debt instrument issued with de minimis OID at 
a premium (as defined in  1.1272-2(b)(2)), the subsequent holder 
does not include the de minimis OID in income. Otherwise, a 
subsequent holder includes any discount in income under the 
market discount rules (sections 1276 through 1278) rather than 
under the rules of this paragraph (d)(5). 

(iv) 

Cross-reference. 

See  1.1272-3 for an election by a 
holder to treat de minimis OID as OID. 

(e) 

Definitions

_(1) 

Installment obligation. 

An installment 
obligation is a debt instrument that provides for the payment of 
any amount other than qualified stated interest before maturity. 

(2) 

Self-amortizing installment obligation. 

A self-amortizing installment obligation is an obligation that provides 
for equal payments composed of principal and qualified stated 
interest that are unconditionally payable at least annually 
during the entire term of the debt instrument with no significant 
additional payment required at maturity. 

(3) 

Weighted average maturity. 

The weighted average 
maturity of a debt instrument is the sum of the following amounts 
determined for each payment under the instrument (other than a 
payment of qualified stated interest)_

(i) The number of complete years from the issue date until the payment is made; multiplied by 

(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the 
payment and the denominator of which is the debt instrument's 
stated redemption price at maturity.

(f) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section. 






Example 1. Qualified stated interest

_(i) 

Facts. 

On 
January 1, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a 
debt instrument that matures on January 1, 1999, and has a stated 
principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt 
instrument provides for interest payments of $8,000 on January 1, 
1996, and January 1, 1997, and quarterly interest payments of 
$1,942.65, beginning on April 1, 1997. 

(ii) 

Amount of qualified stated interest. 

The annual 
payments of $8,000 and the quarterly payments of $1,942.65 are 
payable at a single fixed rate because 8 percent, compounded 
annually, is equivalent to 7.77 percent, compounded quarterly. 
Consequently, all stated interest payments under the debt 
instrument are qualified stated interest payments. 



Example 2. Qualified stated interest with short initial 
payment interval. 

On October 1, 1994, A purchases at original 
issue, for $100,000, a debt instrument that matures on January 1, 
1998, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at 
maturity. The debt instrument provides for an interest payment 
of $2,000 on January 1, 1995, and interest payments of $8,000 on 
January 1, 1996, January 1, 1997, and January 1, 1998. Under 
paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, all stated interest 
payments on the debt instrument are computed at a single fixed 
rate and are qualified stated interest payments. 




Example 3. Stated interest in excess of qualified stated 
interest

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, B purchases at original 
issue, for $100,000, C corporation's 5-year debt instrument. The 
debt instrument provides for a principal payment of $100,000, 
payable at maturity, and calls for annual interest payments of 
$10,000 for the first 3 years and annual interest payments of 
$10,600 for the last 2 years. 

(ii) 

Payments in excess of qualified stated interest. 

All 
of the first three interest payments and $10,000 of each of the 
last two interest payments are qualified stated interest payments 
within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the remaining $600 of each of 
the last two interest payments is included in the stated 
redemption price at maturity, so that the stated redemption price 
at maturity is $101,200. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, the weighted average maturity of the debt instrument is 
4.994 years [(4 years x $600/$101,200)+(5 years x $100,600/$101,200)]. The de minimis amount, or one-fourth
of 1 percent of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the weighted average maturity, is $1,263.50.
Because the actual amount of discount, $1,200, is less than the de minimis amount, 
the instrument is treated as having no OID, and, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all of the interest payments
are treated as qualified stated interest payments. 




Example 4. Qualified stated interest on a debt instrument 
that is subject to a contingency

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, 
A issues, for $100,000, a 10-year debt instrument that provides 
for a $100,000 principal payment at maturity and for annual 
interest payments of $10,000. Under the terms of the debt 
instrument, however, the interest payments for each of the final 
five years will be reduced to $5,000 if a specified annual level 
of earnings is not attained by A by the end of year five. 


(ii) 

Amount of qualified stated interest. 

If the payment 
schedule determined by assuming that the specified earnings level 
will be attained is treated as the debt instrument's sole payment 
schedule, the instrument would provide for annual qualified 
stated interest payments of $10,000. If the payment schedule 
determined by assuming that the specified earnings level will not 
be attained is treated as the instrument's sole payment schedule, 
however, only $5,000 of each annual interest payment would 
constitute qualified stated interest. Accordingly, under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, only $5,000 of each annual 
interest payment constitutes qualified stated interest. Any 
excess of each annual interest payment over $5,000 is included in 
the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity. 




Example 5. De minimis OID; interest holiday

_(i) 

Facts. 

On 
January 1, 1995, C purchases at original issue, for $97,561, a 
debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2007, and has a stated 
principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt 
instrument provides for an initial interest holiday of 1 quarter 
and quarterly interest payments of $2,500 thereafter (beginning 
on July 1, 1995). The issue price of the debt instrument is 
$97,561. C chooses to accrue OID based on quarterly accrual 
periods. 

(ii) 

De minimis amount of OID. 

But for the interest 
holiday, all stated interest on the debt instrument would be 
qualified stated interest. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section, for purposes of determining whether the debt instrument 
has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price at maturity of 
the instrument is $100,061 ($97,561 (issue price) plus $2,500 
(the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($2,500) and the 
amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated principal 
amount over its issue price ($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument 
is treated as having OID of $2,500 ($100,061 minus $97,561). 
Because this amount is less than the de minimis amount of 
$3,001.83 (0.0025 multiplied by $100,061 multiplied by 12 
complete years to maturity), the debt instrument is treated as 
having no OID, and all stated interest is treated as qualified 
stated interest. 



Example 6. De minimis OID; teaser rate

_(i) 

Facts. 

The 
facts are the same as in 

Example 5 

of this paragraph (f) except 
that C uses an initial semiannual accrual period rather than an 
initial quarterly accrual period. 


(ii) 

De minimis amount of OID. 

The debt instrument provides 
for an initial teaser rate because the interest rate for the 
semiannual accrual period is less than the interest rate 
applicable to the subsequent quarterly accrual periods. But for 
the initial teaser rate, all stated interest on the debt 
instrument would be qualified stated interest. Under paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the 
debt instrument has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price 
at maturity of the instrument is $100,123.50 ($97,561 (issue 
price) plus $2,562.50 (the greater of the amount of foregone 
interest ($2,562.50) and the amount equal to the excess of the 
instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price 
($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument is treated as having OID of 
$2,562.50 ($100,123.50 minus $97,561). Because this amount is 
less than the de minimis amount of $3,003.71 (0.0025 multiplied 
by $100,123.50 multiplied by 12 complete years to maturity), the 
debt instrument is treated as having no OID, and all stated 
interest is treated as qualified stated interest.

 1.1273-2 


Determination of issue price and issue date. 


(a) 

Debt instruments issued for money_

(1) 

Issue price. 

If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is issued for money, the issue price of each debt instrument
in the issue is the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt instruments is sold for money. Thus, if an issue
consists of a single debt instrument that is issued for money, the issue price of the debt instrument is the amount paid
for the instrument. For example, in the case of a debt instrument evidencing a loan to a natural person, the issue price
of the instrument is the amount loaned. See  1.1275-2(d) for rules regarding Treasury securities. For
purposes of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in certain circumstances, nonfunctional
currency. See  1.988-2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather
than as property. 
(2) 

Issue date. 

The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the first settlement date or closing date,
whichever is applicable, on which a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue is sold for money. 
(b) 

Publicly traded debt instruments issued for property_

(1) 

Issue price. 

If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is traded on an established market (within the meaning of
paragraph (f) of this section) and the issue is not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the issue price of
each debt instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the debt instrument, determined as of the issue date (as
defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). 
(2) 

Issue date. 

The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the first date on which a substantial amount
of the traded debt instruments in the issue is issued.

(c) 

Debt instruments issued for publicly traded property_

(1) 

Issue price. 

If a substantial amount of the debt instruments in an issue is issued for property that is traded on an established market
(within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) and the issue is not described in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of
this section, the issue price of each debt instrument in the issue is the fair market value of the property, determined
as of the issue date (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For purposes of the preceding sentence, property
means a debt instrument, stock, security, contract, commodity, or nonfunctional currency. But see  1.988-2(b)(2)
for circumstances when nonfunctional currency is treated as money rather than as property. 
(2) 

Issue date. 

The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the first date on which a substantial amount
of the debt instruments in the issue is issued for traded property. 
(d) 

Other debt instruments_

(1) 

Issue price. 

If an issue of debt instruments is not described in paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, the issue price
of each debt instrument in the issue is determined as if the debt instrument were a separate issue. If the issue price
of a debt instrument that is treated as a separate issue under the preceding sentence is not determined under paragraph
(a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of this section, and if section 1274 applies to the debt instrument, the issue price of the
instrument is determined under section 1274. Otherwise, the issue price of the debt instrument is its stated redemption
price at maturity under section 1273(b)(4). See section 1274(c) and  1.1274-1 to determine if section
1274 applies to a debt instrument. 
(2) 

Issue date. 

The issue date of an issue described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the date on which the debt instrument is issued
for money or in a sale or exchange. 
(e) 

Special rule for certain sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons. 

For purposes of determining the issue price and issue date of a debt instrument under this section, sales to bond houses,
brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers
are ignored. 
(f) 

Traded on an established market (publicly traded)_

(1) 

In general. 

Property (including a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is traded on an established
market for purposes of this section if, at any time during the 60-day period ending 30 days after the issue date, the
property is described in paragraph (f)(2), (f)(3), (f)(4), or (f)(5) of this section. 
(2) 

Exchange listed property. 

Property is described in this paragraph (f)(2) if it is listed on_
(i) A national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f);

(ii) An interdealer quotation system sponsored by a national securities association registered under section 15A
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3); or 
(iii) The International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Limited, the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, or any other foreign exchange or board of trade that is designated by the
Commissioner in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). 
(3) 

Market traded property. 

Property is described in this paragraph (f)(3) if it is property of a kind that is traded either on a board of trade designated
as a contract market by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission or on an interbank market. 
(4) 

Property appearing on a quotation medium. 

Property is described in this paragraph (f)(4) if it appears on a system of general circulation (including a computer
listing disseminated to subscribing brokers, dealers, or traders) that provides a reasonable basis to determine
fair market value by disseminating either recent price quotations (including rates, yields, or other pricing information)
of one or more identified brokers, dealers, or traders or actual prices (including rates, yields, or other pricing
information) of recent sales transactions (a quotation medium). A quotation medium does not include a directory
or listing of brokers, dealers, or traders for specific securities, such as yellow sheets, that provides neither
price quotations nor actual prices of recent sales transactions. 
(5) 

Readily quotable debt instruments_

(i) 

In general. 

A debt instrument is described in this paragraph (f)(5) if price quotations are readily available from dealers, brokers,
or traders. 
(ii) 

Safe harbors. 

A debt instrument is not considered to be described in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section if_
(A) No other outstanding debt instrument of the issuer (or of any person who guarantees the debt instrument) is described
in paragraph (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(4) of this section (other traded debt); 
(B) The original stated principal amount of the issue that includes the debt instrument does not exceed $25 million;

(C) The conditions and covenants relating to the issuer's performance with respect to the debt instrument are materially
less restrictive than the conditions and covenants included in all of the issuer's other traded debt (e.g., the debt
instrument is subject to an economically significant subordination provision whereas the issuer's other traded
debt is senior); or 
(D) The maturity date of the debt instrument is more than 3 years after the latest maturity date of the issuer's other
traded debt. 
(6) 

Effect of certain temporary restrictions on trading. 

If there is any temporary restriction on trading a purpose of which is to avoid the characterization of the property
as one that is traded on an established market for Federal income tax purposes, then the property is treated as traded
on an established market. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a temporary restriction on trading need not be imposed
by the issuer. 
(7) 

Convertible debt instruments. 

A debt instrument is not treated as traded on an established market solely because the debt instrument is convertible
into property that is so traded. 
(g) 

Treatment of certain cash payments incident to lending transactions_

(1) 

Applicability. 

The provisions of this paragraph (g) apply to cash payments made incident to private lending transactions (including
seller financing).

(2) 

Payments from borrower to lender

_(i) 

Money lending 
transaction. 

In a lending transaction to which section 
1273(b)(2) applies, a payment from the borrower to the lender 
(other than a payment for property or for services provided by 
the lender, such as commitment fees or loan processing costs) 
reduces the issue price of the debt instrument evidencing the 
loan. However, solely for purposes of determining the tax 
consequences to the borrower, the issue price is not reduced if 
the payment is deductible under section 461(g)(2). 



(ii) 

Section 1274 transaction. 

In a lending transaction to 
which section 1274 applies, a payment from the buyer-borrower to 
the seller-lender that is designated as interest or points 
reduces the stated principal amount of the debt instrument 
evidencing the loan, but is included in the purchase price of the 
property. If the payment is deductible under section 461(g)(2), 
however, the issue price of the debt instrument (as otherwise 
determined under section 1274 and the rule in the preceding 
sentence) is increased by the amount of the payment to compute 
the buyer-borrower's interest deductions under section 163. 



(3) 

Payments from lender to borrower. 

A payment from the 
lender to the borrower in a lending transaction is treated as an 
amount loaned. 



(4) 

Payments between lender and third party. 

If, as part of 
a lending transaction, a party other than the borrower (the third 
party) makes a payment to the lender, that payment is treated in 
appropriate circumstances as made from the third party to the 
borrower followed by a payment in the same amount from the 
borrower to the lender and governed by the provisions of 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section. If, as part of a lending 
transaction, the lender makes a payment to a third party, that 
payment is treated in appropriate circumstances as an additional 
amount loaned to the borrower and then paid by the borrower to 
the third party. The character of the deemed payment between the 
borrower and the third party depends on the substance of the 
transaction. 



(5) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this paragraph (g). 







Example 1. Payments from borrower to lender in a cash 
transaction_

(i) 

Facts. 

A lends $100,000 to B for a term of 10 
years. At the time the loan is made, B pays $4,000 in points to 
A. Assume that the points are not deductible by B under section 
461(g)(2) and that the stated redemption price at maturity of the 
debt instrument is $100,000. 



(ii) 

Payment results in OID. 

Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of 
this section, the issue price of B's debt instrument evidencing 
the loan is $96,000. Because the amount of OID on the debt 
instrument ($4,000) is more than a de minimis amount of OID, A 
accounts for the OID under  1.1272-1. B accounts for the OID 
under  1.163-7. 






Example 2. Payments from borrower to lender in a section 
1274 transaction_

(i) 

Facts. 

A sells property to B for 
$1,000,000 in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive 
situation (within the meaning of  1.1274-3). In consideration 
for the property, B gives A $300,000 and issues a 5-year debt 
instrument that has a stated principal amount of $700,000, 
payable at maturity, and that calls for semiannual payments of 
interest at a rate of 8.5 percent. In addition to the cash 
downpayment, B pays A $14,000 designated as points on the loan. 
Assume that the points are not deductible under section 
461(g)(2). 



(ii) 

Issue price. 

Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the stated principal amount of B's debt instrument is 
^$686,000 ($700,000 minus $14,000). Assuming a test rate of 9 
percent, compounded semiannually, the imputed principal amount of 
B's debt instrument under  1.1274-2(c)(1) is $686,153. Under 
 1.1274-2(b)(1), the issue price of B's debt instrument is the 
stated principal amount of $686,000. Because the amount of OID 
on the debt instrument ($700,000^$686,000, or $14,000) is more 
than a de minimis amount of OID, A accounts for the OID under 
 1.1272-1 and B accounts for the OID under  1.163-7. B's basis 
in the property purchased is $1,000,000 ($686,000 debt instrument 
plus $314,000 cash payments). 





Example 3. Payments between lender and third party (seller-paid points)_

(i) 

Facts. 

A sells real property to B for $500,000 
in a transaction that is not a potentially abusive situation 
(within the meaning of  1.1274-3). B makes a cash down payment 
of $100,000 and borrows $400,000 of the purchase price from a 
lender, L, repayable in annual installments over a term of 15 
years calling for interest at a rate of 9 percent, compounded 
annually. As part of the transaction, A makes a payment of 
$8,000 to L to facilitate the loan to B. 



(ii) 

Payment results in a de minimis amount of OID. 

Under 
the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(4) of this 
section, B is treated as having made an $8,000 payment directly 
to L and a payment of only $492,000 to A for the property. Thus, 
B's basis in the property is $492,000. The payment to L reduces 
the issue price of B's debt instrument to $392,000, resulting in 
$8,000 of OID ($400,000^$392,000). Because the amount of OID 
is de minimis under  1.1273-1(d), L accounts for the de minimis 
OID under  1.1273-1(d)(5). But see  1.1272-3 (election to 
treat de minimis OID as OID). B accounts for the de minimis OID 
under  1.163-7. 









(h) 

Investment units_

(1) 

In general. 

Under section 
1273(c)(2), an investment unit is treated as if the investment 
unit were a debt instrument. The issue price of the investment 
unit is determined under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of 
this section, if applicable. The issue price of the investment 
unit is then allocated between the debt instrument and the 
property right (or rights) that comprise the unit based on their 
relative fair market values. If paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1), and 
(c)(1) of this section are not applicable, however, the issue 
price of the debt instrument that is part of the investment unit 
is determined under section 1273(b)(4) or 1274, whichever is 
applicable. 



(2) 

Consistent allocation by holders and issuer. 

The 
issuer's allocation of the issue price of the investment unit is 
binding on all holders of the investment unit. However, the 
issuer's determination is not binding on a holder that explicitly 
discloses that its allocation is different from the issuer's 
allocation. Unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner, the 
disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's 
timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that 
includes the acquisition date of the investment unit. See 
 1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to 
disclose certain information to holders. 



(i) [Reserved] 



(j) 

Convertible debt instruments. 

The issue price of a debt 
instrument includes any amount paid for an option to convert the 
instrument into stock (or another debt instrument) of either the 
issuer or a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) 
or 707(b)(1)) or into cash or other property in an amount equal 
to the approximate value of such stock (or debt instrument). 



(k) 

Below-market loans subject to section 7872(b). 

The 
issue price of a below-market loan subject to section 7872(b) (a 
term loan other than a gift loan) is the issue price determined 
under this section, reduced by the excess amount determined under 
section 7872(b)(1). 



(l) [Reserved] 



(m) 

Treatment of amounts representing pre-issuance accrued 
interest_

(1) 

Applicability. 

Paragraph (m)(2) of this section 
provides an alternative to the general rule of this section for 
determining the issue price of a debt instrument if_


(i) A portion of the initial purchase price of the 
instrument is allocable to interest that has accrued prior to the 
issue date (pre-issuance accrued interest); and


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


(ii) The instrument provides for a payment of stated 
interest on the first payment date within 1 year of the issue 
date that equals or exceeds the amount of the pre-issuance 
accrued interest. 



(2) 

Exclusion of pre-issuance accrued interest from issue 
price. 

If a debt instrument meets the requirements of paragraph 
(m)(1) of this section, the instrument's issue price may be 
computed by subtracting from the issue price (as otherwise 
computed under this section) the amount of pre-issuance accrued 
interest. If the issue price of the debt instrument is computed 
in this manner, a portion of the stated interest payable on the 
first payment date must be treated as a return of the excluded 
pre-issuance accrued interest, rather than as an amount payable 
on the instrument. 



(3) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates the rule of 
paragraph (m) of this section. 











Example. 

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 15, 1995, A purchases at 
original issue, for $1,005, B corporation's debt instrument. The 
debt instrument provides for a payment of principal of $1,000 on 
January 1, 2005, and provides for semiannual interest payments of 
$60 on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 
1995. 



(ii) 

Determination of pre-issuance accrued interest. 

Under 
paragraphs (m)(1) and (m)(2) of this section, $5 of the $1,005 
initial purchase price of the debt instrument is allocable to 
pre-issuance accrued interest. Accordingly, the debt 
instrument's issue price may be computed by subtracting the 
amount of pre-issuance accrued interest ($5) from the issue price 
otherwise computed under this section ($1,005), resulting in an 
issue price of $1,000. If the issue price is computed in this 
manner, $5 of the $60 payment made on July 1, 1995, must be 
treated as a repayment by B of the pre-issuance accrued interest. 




 1.1274-1

Debt instruments to which section 1274 applies. 





(a) 

In general. 

Subject to the exceptions and limitations 
in paragraph (b) of this section, section 1274 and this section 
apply to any debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale 
or exchange of property. For purposes of section 1274, property 
includes debt instruments and investment units, but does not 
include money, services, or the right to use property. For the 
treatment of certain obligations given in exchange for services 
or the use of property, see sections 404 and 467. For purposes 
of this paragraph (a), money includes functional currency and, in 
certain circumstances, nonfunctional currency. See  1.988-2(b)(2) for circumstances when nonfunctional
currency is treated 
as money rather than as property. 



(b) 

Exceptions_

(1) 

Debt instrument with adequate stated 
interest and no OID. 

Section 1274 does not apply to a debt 
instrument if_


(i) All interest payable on the instrument is qualified 
stated interest; 



(ii) The stated rate of interest is at least equal to the 
test rate of interest (as defined in  1.1274-4); 



(iii) The debt instrument is not issued in a potentially 
abusive situation (as defined in  1.1274-3); and 



(iv) No payment from the buyer-borrower to the seller-lender 
designated as points or interest is made at the time of issuance 
of the debt instrument. 



(2) 

Exceptions under sections 1274(c)(1)(B), 1274(c)(3), 
1274A(c), and 1275(b)(1)_

(i) 

In general. 

Sections 
1274(c)(1)(B), 1274(c)(3), 1274A(c), and 1275(b)(1) describe 
certain transactions to which section 1274 does not apply. This 
paragraph (b)(2) provides certain rules to be used in applying 
those exceptions. 



(ii) 

Special rules for certain exceptions under section 
1274(c)(3)_

(A) 

Determination of sales price for certain sales of 
farms. 

For purposes of section 1274(c)(3)(A), the determination 
as to whether the sales price cannot exceed $1,000,000 is made 
without regard to any other exception to, or limitation on, the 
applicability of section 1274 (e.g., without regard to the 
special rules regarding sales of principal residences and land 
transfers between related persons). In addition, the sales price 
is determined without regard to section 1274 and without regard 
to any stated interest. The sales price includes the amount of 
any liability included in the amount realized from the sale or 
exchange. See  1.1001-2. 



(B) 

Sales involving total payments of $250,000 or less. 


Under section 1274(c)(3)(C), the determination of the amount of 
payments due under all debt instruments and the amount of other 
consideration to be received is made as of the date of the sale 
or exchange or, if earlier, the contract date. If the precise 
amount due under any debt instrument or the precise amount of any 
other consideration to be received cannot be determined as of 
that date, section 1274(c)(3)(C) applies only if it can be 
determined that the maximum of the aggregate amount of payments 
due under the debt instruments and other consideration to be 
received cannot exceed $250,000. For purposes of section 
1274(c)(3)(C), if a liability is assumed or property is taken 
subject to a liability, the aggregate amount of payments due 
includes the outstanding principal balance or adjusted issue 
price (in the case of an obligation originally issued at a 
discount) of the obligation. 



(C) 

Coordination with section 1273 and  1.1273-2. 

In 
accordance with section 1274(c)(3)(D), section 1274 and this 
section do not apply if the issue price of a debt instrument 
issued in consideration for the sale or exchange of property is 
determined under paragraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or (c)(1) of  1.1273-2. 



(3) 

Other exceptions to section 1274_

(i) 

Holders of certain 
below-market instruments. 

Section 1274 does not apply to any 
holder of a debt instrument that is issued in consideration for 
the sale or exchange of personal use property (within the meaning 
of section 1275(b)(3)) in the hands of the issuer and that 
evidences a below-market loan described in section 7872(c)(1). 



(ii) 

Transactions involving certain demand loans. 

Section 
1274 does not apply to any debt instrument that evidences a 
demand loan that is a below-market loan described in section 
7872(c)(1). 



(iii) 

Certain transfers subject to section 1041. 

Section 
1274 does not apply to any debt instrument issued in 
consideration for a transfer of property subject to section 1041 
(relating to transfers of property between spouses or incident to 
divorce).

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section. 






Example 1. Single stated rate paid semiannually. 

A debt 
instrument issued in consideration for the sale of nonpublicly 
traded property in a transaction that is not a potentially 
abusive situation calls for the payment of a principal amount of 
$1,000,000 at the end of a 10-year term and 20 semiannual 
interest payments of $60,000. Assume that the test rate of 
interest is 12 percent, compounded semiannually. The debt 
instrument is not subject to section 1274 because it provides for 
interest equal to the test rate and all interest payable on the 
instrument is qualified stated interest. 


Example 2. Sale of farm for debt instrument with contingent 
interest_

(i) 

Facts. 

On July 1, 1995, A, an individual, sells to 
B land used as a farm within the meaning of section 6420(c)(2). 
As partial consideration for the sale, B issues a debt instrument 
calling for a single $500,000 payment due in 10 years unless 
profits from the land in each of the 10 years preceding maturity 
of the debt instrument exceed a specified amount, in which case B 
is to make a payment of $1,200,000. The debt instrument does not 
provide for interest. 
(ii) 

Total payments may exceed $1,000,000. 

Even though the 
total payments ultimately payable under the contract may be less 
than $1,000,000, at the time of the sale or exchange it cannot be 
determined that the sales price cannot exceed $1,000,000. Thus, 
the sale of the land used as a farm is not an excepted 
transaction described in section 1274(c)(3)(A). 


Example 3. Sale between related parties subject to section 
483(e)_

(i) 

Facts. 

On July 1, 1995, A, an individual, sells land 
(not used as a farm within the meaning of section 6420(c)(2)) to 
A's child B for $650,000. In consideration for the sale, B 
issues a 10-year debt instrument to A that calls for a payment of 
$650,000. No other consideration is given. The debt instrument 
does not provide for interest. 
(ii) 

Treatment of debt instrument. 

For purposes of section 
483(e), the $650,000 debt instrument is treated as two separate 
debt instruments: a $500,000 debt instrument and a $150,000 debt 
instrument. The $500,000 debt instrument is subject to section 
483(e), and accordingly is covered by the exception from section 
1274 described in section 1274(c)(3)(F). Because the amount of 
the payments due as consideration for the sale exceeds $250,000, 
however, the $150,000 debt instrument is subject to section 1274. 


 1.1274-2 

Issue price of debt instruments to which section 1274 
applies. 


(a) 

In general. 

If section 1274 applies to a debt 
instrument, section 1274 and this section determine the issue 
price of the debt instrument. For rules relating to the 
determination of the amount and timing of OID to be included in 
income, see section 1272 and the regulations thereunder. 
(b) 

Issue price_

(1) 

Debt instruments that provide for 
adequate stated interest; stated principal amount. 

The issue 
price of a debt instrument that provides for adequate stated 
interest is the stated principal amount of the debt instrument. 
For purposes of section 1274, the stated principal amount of a 
debt instrument is the aggregate amount of all payments due under 
the debt instrument, excluding any amount of stated interest. 
Under  1.1273-2(g)(2)(ii), however, the stated principal amount 
of a debt instrument is reduced by any payment from the buyer- 
borrower to the seller-lender that is designated as interest or 
points. See 

Example 2 

of  1.1273-2(g)(5). 
(2) 

Debt instruments that do not provide for adequate stated 
interest; imputed principal amount. 

The issue price of a debt 
instrument that does not provide for adequate stated interest is 
the imputed principal amount of the debt instrument. 
(3) 

Debt instruments issued in a potentially abusive 
situation; fair market value. 

Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (b)(2) of this section, in the case of a debt instrument 
issued in a potentially abusive situation (as defined in 
 1.1274-3), the issue price of the debt instrument is the fair 
market value of the property received in exchange for the debt 
instrument, reduced by the fair market value of any consideration 
other than the debt instrument issued in consideration for the 
sale or exchange. 
(c) 

Determination of whether a debt instrument provides for 
adequate stated interest_

(1) 

In general. 

A debt instrument 
provides for adequate stated interest if its stated principal 
amount is less than or equal to its imputed principal amount. 
Imputed principal amount means the sum of the present values, as 
of the issue date, of all payments, including payments of stated 
interest, due under the debt instrument (determined by using a 
discount rate equal to the test rate of interest as determined 
under  1.1274-4). If a debt instrument has a single fixed rate 
of interest that is paid or compounded at least annually, and 
that rate is equal to or greater than the test rate, the debt 
instrument has adequate stated interest. 
(2) 

Determination of present value. 

The present value of a 
payment is determined by discounting the payment from the date it 
becomes due to the date of the sale or exchange at the test rate 
of interest. To determine present value, a compounding period 
must be selected, and the test rate must be based on the same 
compounding period.

(d) 

Treatment of certain options. 

This paragraph (d) 
provides rules for determining the issue price of a debt 
instrument to which section 1274 applies (other than a debt 
instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation) that is 
subject to one or more options described in both paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (c)(5) of  1.1272-1. Under this paragraph (d), an 
issuer will be deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or 
combination of options in a manner that minimizes the 
instrument's imputed principal amount, and a holder will be 
deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of 
options in a manner that maximizes the instrument's imputed 
principal amount. If both the issuer and the holder have 
options, the rules of this paragraph (d) are applied to the 
options in the order that they may be exercised. Thus, the 
deemed exercise of one option may eliminate other options that 
are later in time. See  1.1272-1(c)(5) to determine the debt 
instrument's yield and maturity for purposes of determining the 
accrual of OID with respect to the instrument. 
(e) 

Mandatory sinking funds. 

In determining the issue price 
of a debt instrument to which section 1274 applies (other than a 
debt instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation) and 
that is subject to a mandatory sinking fund provision described 
in  1.1272-1(c)(3)(ii), the mandatory sinking fund provision is 
ignored. 
(f) 

Treatment of variable rate debt instruments_

(1) 

Stated 
interest at a qualified floating rate_

(i) 

In general. 

For 
purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the imputed principal 
amount of a variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of 
 1.1275-5(a)) that provides for stated interest at a qualified 
floating rate (or rates) is determined by assuming that the 
instrument provides for a fixed rate of interest for each accrual 
period to which a qualified floating rate applies. For purposes 
of the preceding sentence, the assumed fixed rate in each accrual 
period is the greater of_


(A) The value of the applicable qualified floating rate as 
of the first date on which there is a binding written contract 
that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or 
exchange is ultimately consummated; or 
(B) The value of the applicable qualified floating rate as 
of the date on which the sale or exchange occurs. 
(ii) 

Interest rate restrictions. 

Notwithstanding paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section, if, as a result of interest rate 
restrictions (such as an interest rate cap), the expected yield 
of the debt instrument taking the restrictions into account is 
significantly less than the expected yield of the debt instrument 
without regard to the restrictions, the interest payments on the 
debt instrument (other than any fixed interest payments) are 
treated as contingent payments. Reasonably symmetric interest 
rate caps and floors, or reasonably symmetric governors, that are 
fixed throughout the term of the debt instrument do not result in 
the debt instrument being subject to this rule. 
(2) 

Stated interest at a single objective rate. 

For 
purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the imputed principal 
amount of a variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of 
 1.1275-5(a)) that provides for stated interest at a single 
objective rate is determined by treating the interest payments as 
contingent payments. 
(g) 

Contingent payments. 

[Reserved] 
(h) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section. Each example assumes a 30-day month, 360-day 
year. In addition, each example assumes that the debt instrument 
is not a qualified debt instrument (as defined in section 
1274A(b)) and is not issued in a potentially abusive situation. 







Example 1. Debt instrument without a fixed rate over its 
entire term_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, A sells nonpublicly 
traded property to B for a stated purchase price of $3,500,000. 
In consideration for the sale, B makes a down payment of $500,000 
and issues a 10-year debt instrument with a stated principal 
amount of $3,000,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument 
calls for no interest in the first 2 years and interest at a rate 
of 15 percent payable annually over the remaining 8 years of the 
debt instrument. The first interest payment of $450,000 is due 
on December 31, 1997, and the last interest payment is due on 
December 31, 2004, together with the $3,000,000 payment of 
principal. Assume that the test rate of interest applicable to 
the debt instrument is 10.5 percent, compounded annually. 
(ii) 

Applicability of section 1274. 

Because the debt 
instrument does not provide for any interest during the first 2 
years, none of the interest on the debt instrument is qualified 
stated interest. Therefore, the issue price of the debt 
instrument is determined under section 1274. See  1.1274-1(b)(1). If the debt instrument has adequate
stated interest, 
the issue price of the instrument is its stated principal amount. 
Otherwise, the issue price of the debt instrument is its imputed 
principal amount. The debt instrument has adequate stated 
interest only if the stated principal amount is less than or 
equal to the imputed principal amount. 

(iii) 

Determination of imputed principal amount. 

To compute 
the imputed principal amount of the debt instrument, all payments 
due under the debt instrument are discounted back to the issue 
date at 10.5 percent, compounded annually, as follows:

<TEXT>
 

(A) The present value of the $3,000,000 principal payment payable on December 31, 2004, is $1,105,346.59, determined
as follows:








(B) The present value of the eight interest payments of $450,000 as of January 1, 1997, is $2,357,634.55, determined
as follows:






(C) The present value of this interim amount as of January 1, 1995, is $1,930,865.09, determined as follows:






(iv) 

Determination of issue price. 

The debt instrument's imputed principal amount (that is, the present value of all payments due under the debt instrument)
is $3,036,211.68 ($1,105,346.59+$1,930,865.09). Because the stated principal amount ($3,000,000) is less than
the imputed principal amount, the debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest. Therefore, the issue price
of the debt instrument is its stated principal amount ($3,000,000).


Example 2. Debt instrument subject to issuer call option_

(i) 

Facts.

 On January 1, 1995, in partial consideration for the sale of nonpublicly traded property, H corporation issues to
G a 10-year debt instrument, maturing on January 1, 2005, with a stated principal amount of $10,000,000, payable on
that date. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of 8 percent for the first 5 years and 14 percent
for the final 5 years, payable on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. In addition the debt instrument
provides H with the unconditional option to call (prepay) the debt instrument at the end of 5 years for its stated principal
amount of $10,000,000. Assume that the Federal mid-term and long-term rates applicable to the sale based on annual
compounding are 9 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
(ii) 

Option presumed exercised. 

Assuming exercise of the call option, the imputed principal amount as determined under paragraph (d) of this section
is $9,611,034.87 (the present value of all of the payments due within a 5-year term discounted at a test rate of 9 percent,
compounded annually). Assuming nonexercise of the call option, the imputed principal amount is $10,183,354.78
(the present value of all of the payments due within a 10-year term discounted at a test rate of 10 percent, compounded
annually). For purposes of determining the imputed principal amount, the option is presumed exercised because the
imputed principal amount, assuming exercise of the option, is less than the imputed principal amount, assuming the
option is not exercised. Because the option is presumed exercised, the debt instrument fails to provide for adequate
stated interest because the imputed principal amount ($9,611,034.87) is less than the stated principal amount ($10,000,000).
Thus, the issue price of the debt instrument is $9,611,034.87.


Example 3. Variable rate debt instrument with a single rate over its entire term

_(i) 

Facts.

 On January 1, 1995, A sells B nonpublicly traded property. In partial consideration for the sale, B issues a debt instrument
in the principal amount of $1,000,000, payable in 5 years. The debt instrument calls for interest payable monthly
at a rate of 1 percentage point above the average prime lending rate of a major bank for the month preceding the month
of the interest payment. Assume that the test rate of interest applicable to the debt instrument is 10.5 percent, compounded
monthly. Assume also that 1 percentage point above the prime lending rate of the designated bank on the date of the sale
is 12.5 percent, compounded monthly, which is greater than 1 percentage point above the prime lending rate of the designated
bank on the first date on which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which
the sale is consummated.
(ii) 

Debt instrument has adequate stated interest. 

The debt instrument is a variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of  1.1275-5) that provides
for stated interest at a qualified floating rate. Under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the debt instrument
is treated as if it provided for a fixed rate of interest equal to 12.5 percent, compounded monthly. Because the test
rate of interest is 10.5 percent, compounded monthly, the debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest.


Example 4. Debt instrument with a capped variable rate. 

On July 1, 1995, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B in return for a debt instrument with a stated principal amount
of $10,000,000, payable on July 1, 2005. Interest is payable on July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1996, at the
Federal short-term rate for June of the same year. The debt instrument provides, however, that the interest rate cannot
rise above 8.5 percent, compounded annually. Assume that, as of the date the test rate of interest for the debt instrument
is determined, the Federal short-term rate is 8 percent, compounded annually. Assume further that, as a result of
the interest rate cap of 8.5 percent, compounded annually, the expected yield of the debt instrument is significantly
less than the expected yield of the debt instrument if it did not include the interest rate cap. Under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)
of this section, the variable payments are treated as contingent payments for purposes of this section.

 1.1274-3 

Potentially abusive situations defined. 


(a) 

In general. 

For purposes of section 1274, a potentially 
abusive situation means-_
(1) A tax shelter (as defined in section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii)); 
or 
(2) Any other situation involving_
(i) A recent sales transaction; 
(ii) Nonrecourse financing; 
(iii) Financing with a term in excess of the useful life of 
the property; or 
(iv) A debt instrument with clearly excessive interest. 
(b) 

Operating rules

_(1) 

Debt instrument exchanged for 
nonrecourse financing. 

Nonrecourse financing does not include an 
exchange of a nonrecourse debt instrument for an outstanding 
recourse or nonrecourse debt instrument. 
(2) 

Nonrecourse debt with substantial down payment. 


Nonrecourse financing does not include a sale or exchange of a 
real property interest financed by a nonrecourse debt instrument 
if, in addition to the nonrecourse debt instrument, the purchaser 
makes a down payment in money that equals or exceeds 20 percent 
of the total stated purchase price of the real property interest. 
For purposes of the preceding sentence, a real property interest 
means any interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor, 
in real property. 
(3) 

Clearly excessive interest. 

Interest on a debt 
instrument is clearly excessive if the interest, in light of the 
terms of the debt instrument and the creditworthiness of the 
borrower, is clearly greater than the arm's length amount of 
interest that would have been charged in a cash lending 
transaction between the same two parties. 
(c) 

Other situations to be specified by Commissioner. 

The 
Commissioner may designate in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 
situations that, although described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, will not be treated as potentially abusive because they 
do not have the effect of significantly misstating basis or 
amount realized (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). 
(d) 

Consistency rule. 

The issuer's determination that the 
debt instrument is or is not issued in a potentially abusive 
situation is binding on all holders of the debt instrument. 
However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder 
who explicitly discloses a position that is inconsistent with the 
issuer's determination. Unless otherwise prescribed by the 
Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached 
to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the 
taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt 
instrument. See  1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's 
obligation to disclose certain information to holders.

 1.1274-4 

Test rate. 


(a) 

Determination of test rate of interest

_(1) 

In 
general

_(i) 

Test rate is the 3-month rate

. Except as provided 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the test rate of interest 
for a debt instrument issued in consideration for the sale or 
exchange of property is the 3-month rate. 
(ii) 

The 3-month rate

. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section, the 3-month rate is the lower of_
(A) The lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate compounding period) in effect during the 3-month

period ending with the first month in which there is a binding 
written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under 
which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated; or 
(B) The lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the 
appropriate compounding period) in effect during the 3-month 
period ending with the month in which the sale or exchange 
occurs. 
(iii) 

Special rule if there is no binding written contract.

 If there is no binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is
ultimately consummated, the 3-month rate is the lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate compounding
period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the month in which the sale or exchange occurs. 
(2) 

Test rate for certain debt instruments

_(i) 

Sale-leaseback transactions. 

Under section 1274(e) (relating to 
certain sale-leaseback transactions), the test rate is 110 
percent of the 3-month rate determined under paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section. For purposes of section 1274(e)(3), related party 
means a person related to the transferor within the meaning of 
section 267(b) or 707(b)(1). 
(ii) 

Qualified debt instrument. 

Under section 1274A(a), the 
test rate for a qualified debt instrument is no greater than 9 
percent, compounded semiannually, or an equivalent rate based on 
an appropriate compounding period. 
(iii) 

Alternative test rate for short-term obligations

_(A) 

Requirements

. This paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) provides an 
alternative test rate under section 1274(d)(1)(D) for a debt 
instrument with a maturity of 1 year or less. This alternative 
test rate applies, however, only if the debt instrument provides 
for adequate stated interest using the alternative test rate, the 
issuer provides on the face of the debt instrument that the 
instrument qualifies as having adequate stated interest under 
section 1274(d)(1)(D), and the issuer and holder treat or agree 
to treat the instrument as having adequate stated interest. 
(B) 

Alternative test rate

. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii)(A), the alternative test rate is the market yield on 
U.S. Treasury bills with the same maturity date as the debt 
instrument. If the same maturity date is not available, the 
market yield on U.S. Treasury bills that mature in the same week 
or month as the debt instrument is used. The alternative test 
rate is determined as of the date on which there is a binding 
written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under 
which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated or as of the 
date of the sale or exchange, whichever date results in a lower 
rate. If there is no binding written contract, however, the alternative test rate is determined as of the date of the
sale or 
exchange. 
(b) 

Applicable Federal rate

. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the applicable Federal rate for a debt instrument is based on the term
of the instrument (i.e., short-term, mid-term, or long-term). See section 1274(d)(1). The Internal Revenue Service
publishes the applicable Federal rates for each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)
of this chapter). The applicable Federal rates are based on the yield to maturity of outstanding marketable obligations
of the United States of similar maturities during the one month period ending on the 14th day of the month preceding
the month for which the rates are applicable.
(c) 

Special rules to determine the term of a debt instrument for purposes of determining the applicable Federal rate

_(1) 

Installment obligation

. If a debt instrument is an installment obligation (as defined in  1.1273-1(e)(1)), the term of the instrument
is the instrument's weighted average maturity (as defined in  1.1273-1(e)(3)). 
(2) 

Certain variable rate debt instruments

_(i) 

In general

. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section, if a variable rate debt instrument (as defined in 
 1.1275-5(a)) provides for stated interest at a qualified 
floating rate (or rates), the term of the instrument is 
determined by reference to the longest interval between interest 
adjustment dates, or, if the variable rate debt instrument 
provides for a fixed rate, the interval between the issue date 
and the last day on which the fixed rate applies, if this 
interval is longer.

<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Restrictions on adjustments

. If, due to significant 
restrictions on variations in a qualified floating rate or the 
use of certain formulae pursuant to  1.1275-5(b)(2) (e.g., 15 
percent of 1-year LIBOR, plus 800 basis points), the rate in 
substance resembles a fixed rate, the applicable Federal rate is 
determined by reference to the term of the debt instrument. 
(3) 

Counting of either the issue date or the maturity date.

 The term of a debt instrument includes either the issue date or the maturity date, but not both dates. 
(4) 

Certain debt instruments that provide for principal 
payments uncertain as to time

. If a debt instrument provides for 
principal payments that are fixed in total amount but uncertain 
as to time, the term of the instrument is determined by reference 
to the latest possible date on which a principal payment can be 
made or, in the case of an installment obligation, by reference 
to the longest weighted average maturity under any possible 
payment schedule. 
(d) 

Foreign currency loans

. If all of the payments of a 
debt instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference 
to, a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the applicable Federal 
rate for the debt instrument is a foreign currency rate of 
interest that is analogous to the applicable Federal rate 
described in this section. For this purpose, an analogous rate 
of interest is a rate based on yields (with the appropriate 
compounding period) of the highest grade of outstanding 
marketable obligations denominated in such currency (excluding 
any obligations that benefit from special tax exemptions or 
preferential tax rates not available to debt instruments 
generally) with due consideration given to the maturities of the 
obligations. 
(e) 

Examples

. The following examples illustrate the rules 
of this section.





Example 1. Variable rate debt instrument that limits the 
amount of increase and decrease in the rate

_(i) 

Facts

. On July 
1, 1996, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B in return for a 
5-year debt instrument that provides for interest to be paid on 
July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1997, based on the 
prime rate of a local bank on that date. However, the interest 
rate cannot increase or decrease from one year to the next by 
more than .25 percentage points (25 basis points). 
(ii) 

Significant restriction

. The debt instrument is a 
variable rate debt instrument (as defined in  1.1275-5) that 
provides for stated interest at a qualified floating rate. 
Assume that based on all the facts and circumstances, the 
restriction is a significant restriction on the variations in the 
rate of interest. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
the applicable Federal rate is determined by reference to the 
term of the debt instrument, and the applicable Federal rate is 
the Federal mid-term rate. 


Example 2. Installment obligation

_(i) 

Facts

. On January 
1, 1996, A sells nonpublicly traded property to B in exchange for 
a debt instrument that calls for a payment of $500,000 on January 
1, 2001, and a payment of $1,000,000 on January 1, 2006. The 
debt instrument does not provide for any stated interest. 
(ii) 

Determination of term

. The debt instrument is an 
installment obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
the term of the debt instrument is its weighted average maturity 
(as defined in  1.1273-1(e)(3)). The debt instrument's weighted 
average maturity is 8.33 years, which is the sum of (A) the ratio 
of the first payment to total payments (500,000/1,500,000), 
multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date 
until the payment is due (5 years), and (B) the ratio of the 
second payment to total payments (1,000,000/1,500,000), 
multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date 
until the second payment is due (10 years). 
(iii) 

Applicable Federal rate

. Based on the calculation in 
paragraph (ii) of this example, the term of the debt instrument 
is treated as 8.33 years. Consequently, the applicable Federal 
rate is the Federal mid-term rate. 


 1.1274-5 

Assumptions. 


(a) 

In general

. Section 1274 does not apply to a debt 
instrument if the debt instrument is assumed, or property is 
taken subject to the debt instrument, in connection with a sale 
or exchange of property, unless the terms of the debt instrument, 
as part of the sale or exchange, are modified in a manner that 
would constitute an exchange under section 1001. 
(b) 

Modifications of debt instruments

_(1) 

In general

. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a debt 
instrument is assumed, or property is taken subject to a debt 
instrument, in connection with a sale or exchange of property, 
the terms of the debt instrument are modified as part of the sale 
or exchange, and the modification triggers an exchange under 
section 1001, the modification is treated as a separate 
transaction taking place immediately before the sale or exchange 
and is attributed to the seller of the property. For purposes of 
this paragraph (b), a debt instrument is not considered to be 
modified as part of the sale or exchange unless the seller knew 
or had reason to know about the modification. 
(2) 

Election to treat buyer as modifying the debt 
instrument

_(i) 

In general

. Rather than having the rules in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply, the seller and buyer may 
jointly elect to treat the transaction as one in which the buyer 
first assumed the original (unmodified) debt instrument and then 
subsequently modified the debt instrument. For this purpose, the 
modification is treated as a separate transaction taking place 
immediately after the sale or exchange. 
(ii) 

Time and manner of making the election

. The buyer and 
seller make the election under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section by jointly signing a statement that includes the names, 
addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of the seller and 
buyer, and a clear indication that the election is being made 
under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Both the buyer and 
the seller must sign this statement not later than the earlier of 
the last day (including extensions) for filing the Federal income 
tax return of the buyer or seller for the taxable year in which 
the sale or exchange of the property occurs. The buyer and 
seller should attach this signed statement (or a copy thereof) to 
their timely filed Federal income tax returns.

(c) 

Wraparound indebtedness

. For purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section, the issuance of wraparound indebtedness is not 
considered an assumption. 


(d) 

Consideration attributable to assumed debt

. If, as part 
of the consideration for the sale or exchange of property, the 
buyer assumes, or takes the property subject to, an indebtedness 
that was issued with OID (including a debt instrument issued in a 
prior sale or exchange to which section 1274 applied), the 
portion of the buyer's basis in the property and the seller's 
amount realized attributable to the debt instrument equals the 
adjusted issue price of the debt instrument as of the date of the 
sale or exchange. 




Par. 12. 

Sections 1.1274A-1, 1.1275-1 and 1.1275-2 are added to 
read as follows: 




 1.1274A-1 

Special rules for certain transactions where stated 
principal amount does not exceed $2,800,000. 




(a) 

In general

. Section 1274A allows the use of a lower 
test rate for purposes of sections 483 and 1274 in the case of a 
qualified debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(b)) and, 
if elected by the borrower and the lender, the use of the cash 
receipts and disbursements method of accounting for interest on a 
cash method debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(c)(2)). 
This section provides special rules for qualified debt 
instruments and cash method debt instruments. 


(b) 

Rules for both qualified and cash method debt 
instruments

_(1) 

Sale-leaseback transactions

. A debt instrument 
issued in a sale-leaseback transaction (within the meaning of 
section 1274(e)) cannot be either a qualified debt instrument or 
a cash method debt instrument. 


(2) 

Debt instruments calling for contingent payments

. A 
debt instrument that provides for contingent payments cannot be a 
qualified debt instrument unless it can be determined at the time 
of the sale or exchange that the maximum stated principal amount 
due under the debt instrument cannot exceed the amount specified 
in section 1274A(b). Similarly, a debt instrument that provides 
for contingent payments cannot be a cash method debt instrument 
unless it can be determined at the time of the sale or exchange 
that the maximum stated principal amount due under the debt 
instrument cannot exceed the amount specified in section 
1274A(c)(2)(A). 


(3) 

Aggregation of transactions

_(i) 

General rule

. The 
aggregation rules of section 1274A(d)(1) are applied using a 
facts and circumstances test. 


(ii) 

Examples

. The following examples illustrate the 
application of section 1274A(d)(1) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section. 







Example 1

. 

Aggregation of two sales to a single person

. In 
two transactions evidenced by separate sales agreements, A sells 
undivided half interests in Blackacre to B. The sales are 
pursuant to a plan for the sale of a 100 percent interest in 
Blackacre to B. These sales or exchanges are part of a series of 
related transactions and, thus, are treated as a single sale for 
purposes of section 1274A. 




Example 2

. 

Aggregation of two purchases by unrelated 
individuals

. Pursuant to a plan, unrelated individuals X and Y 
purchase undivided half interests in Blackacre from A and 
subsequently contribute these interests to a partnership in 
exchange for equal interests in the partnership. These purchases 
are treated as part of the same transaction and, thus, are 
treated as a single sale for purposes of section 1274A. 




Example 3

. 

Aggregation of sales made pursuant to a tender 
offer

. Fifteen unrelated individuals own all of the stock of X 
Corporation. Y Corporation makes a tender offer to these 15 
shareholders. The terms offered to each shareholder are 
identical. Shareholders holding a majority of the shares of X 
Corporation elect to tender their shares pursuant to Y 
Corporation's offer. These sales are part of the same 
transaction and, thus, are treated as a single sale for purposes 
of section 1274A. 




Example 4

. 

No aggregation for separate sales of similar 
property to unrelated persons

. Pursuant to a newspaper 
advertisement, X Corporation offers for sale similar condominiums 
in a single building. The prices of the units vary due to a 
variety of factors, but the financing terms offered by X 
Corporation to all buyers are identical. The units are purchased 
by unrelated buyers who decided whether to purchase units in the 
building at the price and on the terms offered by X Corporation, 
without regard to the actions of other buyers. Because each 
buyer acts individually, the sales are not part of the same 
transaction or a series of related transactions and, thus, are 
treated as separate sales. 





(4) 

Inflation adjustment of dollar amounts

. Under section 
1274A(d)(2), the dollar amounts specified in sections 1274A(b) 
and 1274A(c)(2)(A) are adjusted for inflation. The dollar 
amounts, adjusted for inflation, are published in the Internal 
Revenue Bulletin (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). 


(c) 

Rules for cash method debt instruments

_(1) 

Time and 
manner of making cash method election

. The borrower and lender 
make the election described in section 1274A(c)(2)(D) by jointly 
signing a statement that includes the names, addresses, and 
taxpayer identification numbers of the borrower and lender, a 
clear indication that an election is being made under section 
1274A(c)(2), and a declaration that the debt instrument with 
respect to which the election is being made fulfills the 
requirements of a cash method debt instrument. Both the borrower 
and the lender must sign this statement not later than the 
earlier of the last day (including extensions) for filing the 
Federal income tax return of the borrower or lender for the 
taxable year in which the debt instrument is issued. The 
borrower and lender should attach this signed statement (or a 
copy thereof) to their timely filed Federal income tax returns. 


(2) 

Successors of electing parties

. Except as otherwise 
provided in this paragraph (c)(2), the cash method election under 
section 1274A(c) applies to any successor of the electing lender 
or borrower. Thus, for any period after the transfer of a cash 
method debt instrument, the successor takes into account the 
interest (including unstated interest) on the instrument under 
the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. 
Nevertheless, if the lender (or any successor thereof) transfers 
the cash method debt instrument to a taxpayer who uses an accrual 
method of accounting, section 1272 rather than section 1274A(c) 
applies to the successor of the lender with respect to the debt 
instrument for any period after the date of the transfer. The 
borrower (or any successor thereof), however, remains on the cash 
receipts and disbursements method of accounting with respect to 
the cash method debt instrument.

(3) 

Modified debt instrument

. In the case of a debt 
instrument issued in a debt-for-debt exchange that qualifies as 
an exchange under section 1001, the debt instrument is eligible 
for the election to be a cash method debt instrument if the other 
prerequisites to making the election in section 1274A(c) are met. 
However, if a principal purpose of the modification is to defer 
interest income or deductions through the use of the election, 
then the debt instrument is not eligible for the election. 


(4) 

Debt incurred or continued to purchase or carry a cash 
method debt instrument

. If a debt instrument is incurred or 
continued to purchase or carry a cash method debt instrument, 
rules similar to those under section 1277 apply to determine the 
timing of the interest deductions for the debt instrument. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, rules similar to those under 
section 265(a)(2) apply to determine whether a debt instrument is 
incurred or continued to purchase or carry a cash method debt 
instrument. 




 1.1275-1 

Definitions. 




(a) 

Applicability

. The definitions contained in this 
section apply for purposes of sections 163(e) and 1271 through 
1275 and the regulations thereunder. 


(b) 

Adjusted issue price

_(1) 

In general

. The adjusted 
issue price of a debt instrument at the beginning of the first 
accrual period is the issue price. Thereafter, the adjusted 
issue price of the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt 
instrument_


(i) Increased by the amount of OID previously includible in 
the gross income of any holder (determined without regard to 
section 1272(a)(7) and section 1272(c)(1)); and 


(ii) Decreased by the amount of any payment previously made 
on the debt instrument other than a payment of qualified stated 
interest. See  1.1275-2(f) for rules regarding adjustments to 
adjusted issue price on a pro rata prepayment. 


(2) 

Adjusted issue price for subsequent holders

. For 
purposes of calculating OID accruals, acquisition premium, or 
market discount, a holder (other than a purchaser at original 
issuance) determines adjusted issue price in any manner 
consistent with the regulations under sections 1271 through 1275. 


(c) 

OID

. OID means original issue discount (as defined in 
section 1273(a) and  1.1273-1). 


(d) 

Debt instrument

. Except as provided in section 
1275(a)(1)(B) (relating to certain annuity contracts), debt 
instrument means any instrument or contractual arrangement that 
constitutes indebtedness under general principles of Federal 
income tax law (including, for example, a certificate of deposit 
or a loan). Nothing in the regulations under sections 163(e), 
483, and 1271 through 1275, however, shall influence whether an 
instrument constitutes indebtedness for Federal income tax 
purposes. 


(e) 

Tax-exempt obligations

. For purposes of section 
1275(a)(3)(B), exempt from tax means exempt from Federal income 
tax. 


(f) 

Issue

. Two or more debt instruments are part of the 
same issue if they have the same credit and payment terms and are 
sold reasonably close in time either pursuant to a common plan or 
as part of a single transaction or a series of related 
transactions. See  1.1275-2(d)(2) for special rules relating to 
reopenings of Treasury securities. 


(g) 

Debt instruments issued by a natural person

. If an 
entity is a primary obligor under a debt instrument, the debt 
instrument is considered to be issued by the entity and not by a 
natural person even if a natural person is a co-maker and is 
jointly liable for the debt instrument's repayment. A debt 
instrument issued by a partnership is considered to be issued by 
the partnership as an entity even if the partnership is composed 
entirely of natural persons. 


(h) 

Publicly offered debt instrument

. A debt instrument is 
publicly offered if it is part of an issue of debt instruments 
the initial offering of which_


(1) Is registered with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission; or 


(2) Would be required to be registered under the Securities 
Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) but for an exemption from 
registration_


(i) Under section 3 of the Securities Act of 1933 (relating 
to exempted securities); 


(ii) Under any law (other than the Securities Act of 1933) 
because of the identity of the issuer or the nature of the 
security; or 


(iii) Because the issue is intended for distribution to 
persons who are not United States persons. 




 1.1275-2 

Special rules relating to debt instruments. 




(a) 

Payment ordering rule_

(1) 

In general

. Except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each payment under 
a debt instrument is treated first as a payment of OID to the 
extent of the OID that has accrued as of the date the payment is 
due and has not been allocated to prior payments, and second as a 
payment of principal. Thus, no portion of any payment is treated 
as prepaid interest. 


(2) 

Exceptions

. The rule in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section does not apply to_

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) A payment of qualified stated interest; 

(ii) A payment of points deductible under section 461(g)(2), 
in the case of the issuer; 

(iii) A pro rata prepayment described in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section; or 

(iv) A payment of additional interest or a similar charge 
provided with respect to amounts that are not paid when due. 

(b) 

Debt instruments distributed by corporations with 
respect to stock_

(1) 

Treatment of distribution. 

For purposes of 
determining the issue price of a debt instrument distributed by a 
corporation with respect to its stock, the instrument is treated 
as issued by the corporation for property. See section 
1275(a)(4). Thus, under section 1273(b)(3), the issue price of a 
distributed debt instrument that is traded on an established 
market is its fair market value. The issue price of a 
distributed debt instrument that is not traded on an established 
market is determined under section 1274 or section 1273(b)(4). 

(2) 

Issue date.

 The issue date of a debt instrument 
distributed by a corporation with respect to its stock is the 
date of the distribution. 

(c) 

Aggregation of debt instruments_

(1) 

General rule.

 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, debt 
instruments issued in connection with the same transaction or 
related transactions (determined based on all the facts and 
circumstances) are treated as a single debt instrument for 
purposes of sections 1271 through 1275 and the regulations 
thereunder. This rule ordinarily applies only to debt 
instruments of a single issuer that are issued to a single 
holder. The Commissioner may, however, aggregate debt 
instruments that are issued by more than one issuer or that are 
issued to more than one holder if the debt instruments are issued 
in an arrangement that is designed to avoid the aggregation rule 
(e.g., debt instruments issued by or to related parties or debt 
instruments originally issued to different holders with the 
understanding that the debt instruments will be transferred to a 
single holder). 

(2) 

Exception if separate issue price established.

 
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a debt 
instrument if_

(i) The debt instrument is part of an issue a substantial 
portion of which is traded on an established market within the 
meaning of  1.1273-2(f); or 

(ii) The debt instrument is part of an issue a substantial 
portion of which is issued for money (or for property traded on 
an established market within the meaning of  1.1273-2(f)) to 
parties who are not related to the issuer or holder and who do 
not purchase other debt instruments of the same issuer in 
connection with the same transaction or related transactions. 

(3) 

Special rule for debt instruments that provide for the 
issuance of additional debt instruments. 

If, under the terms of 
a debt instrument (the original debt instrument), the holder may 
receive one or more additional debt instruments of the issuer, 
the additional debt instrument or instruments are aggregated with 
the original debt instrument. Thus, the payments made pursuant 
to an additional debt instrument are treated as made on the 
original debt instrument, and the distribution by the issuer of 
the additional debt instrument is not considered to be a payment 
made on the original debt instrument. This paragraph (c)(3) 
applies regardless of whether the right to receive an additional 
debt instrument is fixed as of the issue date or is contingent 
upon subsequent events. See  1.1272-1(c) for the treatment of 
certain rights to issue additional debt instruments in lieu of 
cash payments. 

(4) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. 






Example 1. Exception for debt instruments issued separately 
to other purchasers.

 On January 1, 1995, Corporation M issues 
two series of bonds, Series A and Series B. The two series are 
sold for cash and have different terms. Although some holders 
purchase bonds from both series, a substantial portion of the 
bonds is issued to different holders. H purchases bonds from 
both series. Under the exception in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the Series A and Series B bonds purchased by H are not 
aggregated. 



Example 2. Tiered REMICs.

 Z forms a dual tier real estate 
mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). In the dual tier structure, 
Z forms REMIC A to acquire a pool of real estate mortgages and to 
issue a residual interest and several classes of regular 
interests. Contemporaneously, Z forms REMIC B to acquire as 
qualified mortgages all of the regular interests in REMIC A. 
REMIC B issues several classes of regular interests and a 
residual interest, and Z sells all of those interests to 
unrelated parties in a public offering. Under the general rule 
set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all of the regular 
interests issued by REMIC A and held by REMIC B are treated as a 
single debt instrument for purposes of sections 1271 through 
1275. 




(d) 

Special rules for Treasury securities_

(1) 

Issue price 
and issue date.

 The issue price of an issue of Treasury 
securities is the average price of the debt instruments sold. 
The issue date of an issue of Treasury securities is the first 
settlement date on which a substantial amount of the securities 
in the issue is sold. 

(2) 

Reopenings of Treasury securities_

(i) 

Treatment of 
additional Treasury securities.

 Additional Treasury securities 
issued in a qualified reopening are part of the same issue as the 
original Treasury securities and have the same issue date as the 
original Treasury securities. The issue price of both the 
original Treasury securities and the additional Treasury 
securities is the average price at which the original Treasury 
securities were sold. This paragraph (d)(2) applies to qualified 
reopenings that occur on or after March 25, 1992. 

(ii) 

Definitions_

(A) 

Additional Treasury securities.

 Additional Treasury securities are Treasury securities with terms 
that are in all respects identical to the terms of the original 
Treasury securities and that are issued (without regard to 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section) not more than 12 months 
after the original Treasury securities were first issued to the 
public.

<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) 

Original Treasury securities.

 Original Treasury 
securities are securities comprising any issue of outstanding 
Treasury securities. 

(C) 

Qualified reopening.

 A qualified reopening is a 
reopening of Treasury securities intended to alleviate an acute, 
protracted shortage of the original Treasury securities. 

(e) 

Disclosure of certain information to holders.

 Certain 
provisions of the regulations under section 163(e) and sections 
1271 through 1275 provide that the issuer's determination of an 
item controls the holder's treatment of the item. In such a 
case, the issuer must provide the relevant information to the 
holder in a reasonable manner. For example, the issuer may 
provide the name or title and either the address or telephone 
number of a representative of the issuer who will make available 
to holders upon request the information required for holders to 
comply with these provisions of the regulations. 

(f) 

Treatment of pro rata prepayments_

(1) 

Treatment as 
retirement of separate debt instrument.

 A pro rata prepayment is 
treated as a payment in retirement of a portion of a debt 
instrument, which may result in a gain or loss to the holder. 
Generally, the gain or loss is calculated by assuming that the 
original debt instrument consists of two instruments, one that is 
retired and one that remains outstanding. The adjusted issue 
price, holder's adjusted basis, and accrued but unpaid OID of the 
original debt instrument, determined immediately before the pro 
rata prepayment, are allocated between these two instruments 
based on the portion of the instrument that is treated as retired 
by the pro rata prepayment. 

(2) 

Definition of pro rata prepayment.

 For purposes of 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a pro rata prepayment is a 
payment on a debt instrument made prior to maturity that_

(i) Is not made pursuant to the instrument's payment 
schedule (including a payment schedule determined under  1.1272-
1(c)); and 

(ii) Results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each 
payment remaining to be paid on the instrument. 

(g) 

Anti-abuse rule.

 [Reserved] 



Par. 13. 

In  1.1275-3, the section heading and paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised to read as follows: 



 1.1275-3 

OID information reporting requirements. 



(a) 

In general.

 This section provides legending and 
information reporting requirements intended to facilitate the 
reporting of OID. 

(b) 

Information required to be set forth on face of debt 
instruments that are not publicly offered_

(1) 

In general.

 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) or paragraph (d) of this 
section, this paragraph (b) applies to any debt instrument that 
is not publicly offered (within the meaning of  1.1275-1(h)), is 
issued in physical form, and has OID. The issuer of any such 
debt instrument must legend the instrument by stating on the face 
of the instrument that the debt instrument was issued with OID. 
In addition, the issuer must either_

(i) Set forth on the face of the debt instrument the issue 
price, the amount of OID, the issue date, and the yield to 
maturity; or 

(ii) Provide the name or title and either the address or 
telephone number of a representative of the issuer who will, 
beginning no later than 10 days after the issue date, promptly 
make available to holders upon request the information described 
in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. 

(2) 

Time for legending.

 An issuer may satisfy the 
requirements of this paragraph (b) by legending the debt 
instrument when it is first issued in physical form. Legending 
is not required, however, before the first holder of the debt 
instrument disposes of the instrument. 

(3) 

Legend must survive reissuance upon transfer.

 Any new 
physical security that is issued (for example, upon registration 
of transfer of ownership) must contain any required legend. 

(4) 

Exceptions.

 Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not 
apply to debt instruments described in section 1272(a)(2) 
(relating to debt instruments not subject to the periodic OID 
inclusion rules), debt instruments issued by natural persons (as 
defined in  1.6049-4(f)(2)), REMIC regular interests or other 
debt instruments subject to section 1272(a)(6), or stripped bonds 
and coupons within the meaning of section 1286. 



* * * * * 



 1.1275-3T 

[Removed] 





Par. 14.

 Section 1.1275-3T is removed as of February 2, 1994. 



 Par. 15.

 Section 1.1275-5 is added to read as follows: 



 1.1275-5 

Variable rate debt instruments. 



(a) 

Applicability_

(1) 

In general.

 This section provides 
rules for variable rate debt instruments. For purposes of 
section 163(e) and sections 1271 through 1275, a variable rate 
debt instrument is a debt instrument that meets the conditions 
described in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this 
section. 

(2) 

Principal payments.

 The issue price of the debt 
instrument must not exceed the total noncontingent principal 
payments by more than an amount equal to the lesser of_




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) .015 multiplied by the product of the total 
noncontingent principal payments and the number of complete years 
to maturity from the issue date (or, in the case of an 
installment obligation, the weighted average maturity as defined 
in  1.1273-1(e)(3)); or 
(ii) 15 percent of the total noncontingent principal 
payments. 
(3) 

Stated interest_

(i) 

General rule. 

The debt instrument 
must provide for stated interest (compounded or paid at least 
annually) at_

(A) One or more qualified floating rates; 
(B) A single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating 
rates; 
(C) A single objective rate; or 
(D) A single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is 
a qualified inverse floating rate. 
(ii) 

Certain debt instruments bearing interest at a fixed 
rate for an initial period. 

If interest on a debt instrument is 
stated at a fixed rate for an initial period of less than 1 year 
followed by a variable rate that is either a qualified floating 
rate or an objective rate for a subsequent period, and the value 
of the variable rate on the issue date is intended to approximate 
the fixed rate, the fixed rate and the variable rate together 
constitute a single qualified floating rate or objective rate. A 
fixed rate and a variable rate will be conclusively presumed to 
meet the requirements of the preceding sentence if the value of 
the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from the 
value of the fixed rate by more than .25 percentage points (25 
basis points). 
(4) 

Current value. 

The debt instrument must provide that a 
qualified floating rate or objective rate in effect at any time 
during the term of the instrument is set at a current value of 
that rate. A current value is the value of the rate on any day 
that is no earlier than 3 months prior to the first day on which 
that value is in effect and no later than 1 year following that 
first day. 
(b) 

Qualified floating rate_

(1) 

In general. 

A variable 
rate is a qualified floating rate if variations in the value of 
the rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous 
variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in 
which the debt instrument is denominated. The rate may measure 
contemporaneous variations in borrowing costs for the issuer of 
the debt instrument or for issuers in general. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a multiple of a 
qualified floating rate is not a qualified floating rate. If a 
debt instrument provides for two or more qualified floating rates 
that can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same 
values throughout the term of the instrument, the qualified 
floating rates together constitute a single qualified floating 
rate. Two or more qualified floating rates will be conclusively 
presumed to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence if 
the values of all rates on the issue date are within .25 
percentage points (25 basis points) of each other. 
(2) 

Certain rates based on a qualified floating rate. 

A 
variable rate is a qualified floating rate if it is equal to 
either_

(i) The product of a qualified floating rate described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a fixed multiple that is 
greater than zero but not more than 1.35; or 
(ii) The product of a qualified floating rate described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and a fixed multiple that is 
greater than zero but not more than 1.35, increased or decreased 
by a fixed rate. 
(3) 

Restrictions on the stated rate of interest. 

A variable 
rate is not a qualified floating rate if it is subject to a 
restriction or restrictions on the maximum stated interest rate 
(cap), a restriction or restrictions on the minimum stated 
interest rate (floor), a restriction or restrictions on the 
amount of increase or decrease in the stated interest rate 
(governor), or other similar restrictions. Notwithstanding the 
preceding sentence, the following restrictions will not cause a 
variable rate to fail to be a qualified floating rate_

(i) A cap, floor, or governor that is fixed throughout the 
term of the debt instrument; 
(ii) A cap or similar restriction that is not reasonably 
expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on the debt 
instrument to be significantly less than the expected yield 
determined without the cap; 

(iii) A floor or similar restriction that is not reasonably 
expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on the debt 
instrument to be significantly more than the expected yield 
determined without the floor; or

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iv) A governor or similar restriction that is not 
reasonably expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on 
the debt instrument to be significantly more or significantly 
less than the expected yield determined without the governor. 
(c) 

Objective rate_

(1) 

In general. 

An objective rate is a 
rate (other than a qualified floating rate) that is determined 
using a single fixed formula and that is based on_
(i) One or more qualified floating rates; 
(ii) One or more rates where each rate would be a qualified 
floating rate for a debt instrument denominated in a currency 
other than the currency in which the debt instrument is 
denominated; 
(iii) The yield or changes in the price of one or more items 
of personal property (other than stock or debt of the issuer or a 
related party within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), 
provided each item of property is actively traded within the 
meaning of section 1092(d)(1) (determined without regard to 
section 1092(d)(3)); or 
(iv) A combination of rates described in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section. 
(2) 

Other objective rates to be specified by Commissioner. 

The Commissioner may designate in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 
variable rates other than those described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section that will be treated as objective rates (see 
 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). 
(3) 

Qualified inverse floating rate. 

An objective rate 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a qualified 
inverse floating rate if_
(i) The rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified 
floating rate; and 
(ii) The variations in the rate can reasonably be expected 
to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the cost of 
newly borrowed funds (disregarding any restrictions on the rate 
that are described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), 
(b)(3)(iii), and (b)(3)(iv) of this section). 
(4) 

Significant front-loading or back-loading of interest. 


Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a variable rate 
of interest on a debt instrument is not an objective rate if it 
is reasonably expected that the average value of the rate during 
the first half of the instrument's term will be either 
significantly less than or significantly greater than the average 
value of the rate during the final half of the instrument's term. 
(5) 

Tax-exempt debt. 

Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, in the case of any tax-exempt obligation (within 
the meaning of section 1275(a)(3)), a variable rate is an 
objective rate only if it is a qualified inverse floating rate. 
(d) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For purposes of these 
examples, assume that paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this 
section do not apply.

 



Example 1. Rate based on LIBOR. 

X issues a debt instrument 
that provides for annual payments of interest at a rate equal to 
the value of the 1-year London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at 
the end of each year. Variations in the value of 1-year LIBOR 
over the term of the debt instrument can reasonably be expected 
to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly 
borrowed funds over that term. Accordingly, the rate is a 
qualified floating rate. 


Example 2. Rate increased by a fixed amount. 

X issues a 
debt instrument that provides for annual payments of interest at 
a rate equal to 200 basis points (2 percent) plus the current 
value, at the end of each year, of the average yield on 1-year 
Treasury securities as published in Federal Reserve bulletins. 
Variations in the value of this interest rate can reasonably be 
expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of 
newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is a qualified 
floating rate. 


Example 3. Rate based on commercial paper rate. 

X issues a 
debt instrument that provides for a rate of interest that is 
periodically adjusted to equal the current interest rate of 
Bank's commercial paper. Variations in the value of this 
interest rate can reasonably be expected to measure 
contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. 
Accordingly, the rate is a qualified floating rate. 


Example 4. Rate based on changes in the value of a 
commodity index. 

X issues a debt instrument that provides for 
annual interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal 
to the percentage increase, if any, in the value of an index for 
the year immediately preceding the payment. The index is based 
on the prices of several actively traded commodities. Variations 
in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected 
to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly 
borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is not a qualified 
floating rate. However, because the rate is based on changes in 
the prices of actively traded property, the rate is an objective 
rate. 


Example 5. Rate based on a percentage of S&P 500 Index. 

X 
issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest 
payments at the end of each year based on a fixed percentage of 
the value of the S&P 500 Index. Variations in the value of this 
interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure 
contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds 
and, therefore, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. In 
addition, because the interest rate is based on the value of the 
S&P 500 Index rather than on changes in that value, the rate is 
not an objective rate. 


Example 6. Rate based on issuer's profits. 

Z issues a debt 
instrument that provides for annual interest payments equal to 20 
percent of Z's net profits earned during the year immediately 
preceding the payment. Variations in the value of this interest 
rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous 
variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the 
rate is not a qualified floating rate. In addition, because the 
stated rate is neither based on the yield or changes in the price 
of actively traded property nor based on a qualified floating 
rate, the rate is not an objective rate. 


Example 7. Rate based on a multiple of an interest index. 

Z issues a debt instrument with annual interest payments at a 
rate equal to two times the value of 1-year LIBOR as of the 
payment date. Because the rate is a multiple greater than 1.35 
times a qualified floating rate, the rate is not a qualified 
floating rate. However, because the stated rate is based on a 
qualified floating rate using a single fixed formula, the rate is 
an objective rate.

Example 8. Variable rate based on the cost of borrowed 
funds in a foreign currency. 

Y issues a 5-year dollar 
denominated debt instrument that provides for annual interest 
payments at a rate equal to the value of 1-year French franc 
LIBOR as of the payment date. Variations in the value of French 
franc LIBOR do not measure contemporaneous changes in the cost of 
newly borrowed funds in dollars. As a result, the rate is not a 
qualified floating rate for an instrument denominated in dollars. 
However, because French franc LIBOR is a qualified floating rate 
for a debt instrument denominated in French francs, the rate is 
an objective rate. 


Example 9. Qualified inverse floating rate. 

X issues a 
debt instrument that provides for annual interest payments at the 
end of each year at a rate equal to 12 percent minus the value of 
1-year LIBOR as of the payment date. On the issue date, the 
value of 1-year LIBOR is 6 percent. Because the rate can 
reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous 
variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds, it is a qualified 
inverse floating rate. However, if the value of 1-year LIBOR on 
the issue date was 11 percent rather than 6 percent, the rate 
would not be a qualified inverse floating rate because the rate 
could not reasonably be expected to inversely reflect 
contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. 






(e)

 Qualified stated interest and OID with respect to a 
variable rate debt instrument_

(1)

 In general. 

This paragraph 
(e) provides rules to determine the amount and accrual of OID and 
qualified stated interest on a variable rate debt instrument. In 
general, the rules convert the debt instrument into a fixed rate 
debt instrument and then apply the general OID rules to the debt 
instrument. The issue price of a variable rate debt instrument, 
however, is not determined under this paragraph (e). See 
  1.1273-2 and 1.1274-2 to determine the issue price of a 
variable rate debt instrument. 
(2)

 Variable rate debt instrument that provides for annual 
payments of interest at a single variable rate. 

If a variable 
rate debt instrument provides for stated interest at a single 
qualified floating rate or objective rate that is unconditionally 
payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of 
the issuer), or that will be constructively received under 
section 451, at least annually_
(i) All stated interest with respect to the debt instrument 
is qualified stated interest; and 
(ii) The amount of OID, if any, is determined under the 
rules applicable to fixed rate debt instruments by assuming that 
the variable rate is a fixed rate equal to_
(A) In the case of a qualified floating rate or qualified 
inverse floating rate, the value, as of the issue date, of the 
qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate; or 
(B) In the case of an objective rate (other than a qualified 
inverse floating rate), a fixed rate that reflects the yield that 
is reasonably expected for the debt instrument. 
(3)

 All other variable rate debt instruments except for 
those that provide for a fixed rate. 

If a variable rate debt 
instrument is not described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
and does not provide for interest payable at a fixed rate (other 
than an initial fixed rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section), the amount of interest and OID accruals for the 
instrument are determined under this paragraph (e)(3). 
(i)

 Step one: Determine the fixed rate substitute for each 
variable rate provided under the debt instrument_

(A)

 Qualified 
floating rate. 

The fixed rate substitute for each qualified 
floating rate provided for in the debt instrument is the value of 
each rate as of the issue date. If, however, a variable rate 
debt instrument provides for two or more qualified floating rates 
with different intervals between interest adjustment dates, the 
fixed rate substitutes for the rates must be based on intervals 
that are equal in length. For example, if a 4-year debt 
instrument provides for 24 monthly interest payments based on the 
value of the 30-day commercial paper rate on each payment date 
followed by 8 quarterly interest payments based on the value of 
quarterly LIBOR on each payment date, the fixed rate substitutes 
may be based on the values, as of the issue date, of the 90-day 
commercial paper rate and quarterly LIBOR. Alternatively, the 
fixed rate substitutes may be based on the values, as of the 
issue date, of the 30-day commercial paper rate and monthly 
LIBOR. 
(B)

 Qualified inverse floating rate. 

The fixed rate 
substitute for a qualified inverse floating rate is the value of 
the qualified inverse floating rate as of the issue date. 
(C)

 Objective rate. 

The fixed rate substitute for an 
objective rate (other than a qualified inverse floating rate) is 
a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected 
for the debt instrument. 
(ii)

 Step two: Construct the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument. 

The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has terms 
that are identical to those provided under the variable rate debt 
instrument, except that the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument 
provides for the fixed rate substitutes (determined in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this section) in lieu of the qualified floating 
rates or objective rate provided under the variable rate debt 
instrument. 
(iii)

 Step three: Determine the amount of qualified stated 
interest and OID with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument. 

The amount of qualified stated interest and OID, if 
any, are determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument 
under the rules applicable to fixed rate debt instruments and are 
taken into account as if the holder held the equivalent fixed 
rate debt instrument. 
(iv)

 Step four: Make appropriate adjustments for actual 
variable rates. 

Qualified stated interest or OID allocable to an 
accrual period must be increased (or decreased) if the interest 
actually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is 
less than) the interest assumed to be accrued or paid during the 
accrual period under the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. 
This increase or decrease is an adjustment to qualified stated 
interest for the accrual period if the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument (as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this 
section) provides for qualified stated interest and the increase 
or decrease is reflected in the amount actually paid during the 
accrual period. Otherwise, this increase or decrease is an 
adjustment to OID for the accrual period.

(v) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules 
in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. 







Example 1. Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument_

(i) 


Facts. 

X purchases at original issue a 6-year variable rate debt 
instrument that provides for semiannual payments of interest. 
For the first 3 years, the rate of interest is the value of 6-month LIBOR on the payment date. For the final 3 years, the
rate 
is the value of the 6-month T-bill rate on the payment date. On 
the issue date, the value of 6-month LIBOR is 3 percent, 
compounded semiannually, and the 6-month T-bill rate is 2 
percent, compounded semiannually. 
(ii) 

Determination of equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. 


Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the fixed rate 
substitute for 6-month LIBOR is 3 percent, compounded 
semiannually, and the fixed rate substitute for the 6-month T-bill rate is 2 percent, compounded semiannually. Under
paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument is a 6-year debt instrument that provides for 
semiannual payments of interest at 3 percent, compounded 
semiannually, for the first 3 years followed by 2 percent, 
compounded semiannually, for the final 3 years. 


Example 2. Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument with de 
minimis OID_

(i) 

Facts. 

Y purchases at original issue, for 
$100,000, a 4-year variable rate debt instrument that has a 
stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The 
debt instrument provides for monthly payments of interest at the 
end of each month. For the first year, the interest rate is the 
monthly commercial paper rate and for the last 3 years, the 
interest rate is the monthly commercial paper rate plus 100 basis 
points. On the issue date, the monthly commercial paper rate is 
3 percent, compounded monthly. 
(ii) 

Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. 

Under paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument for the variable rate debt instrument is a 4-year debt 
instrument that has an issue price and stated principal amount of 
$100,000. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument provides for 
monthly payments of interest at 3 percent, compounded monthly, 
for the first year ($250 per month) and monthly payments of 
interest at 4 percent, compounded monthly, for the last 3 years 
($333.33 per month). 
(iii) 

De minimis OID. 

Under  1.1273-1(a), because a 
portion (100 basis points) of each interest payment in the final 
3 years is not a qualified stated interest payment, the 
equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has OID of $2,999.88 
($102,999.88 ^$100,000). However, under  1.1273-1(d)(4) (the 
de minimis rule relating to teaser rates and interest holidays), 
the stated redemption price at maturity of the equivalent fixed 
rate debt instrument is $100,999.96 ($100,000 (issue price) plus 
$999.96 (the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($999.96) 
and the amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated 
principal amount over its issue price ($0)). Thus, the 
equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is treated as having OID of 
$999.96 ($100,999.96 ^$100,000). Because this amount is less 
than the de minimis amount of $1,010 (0.0025 multiplied by 
$100,999.96 multiplied by 4 complete years to maturity), the 
equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has de minimis OID. 
Therefore, the variable rate debt instrument has zero OID and all 
stated interest payments are qualified stated interest payments. 


Example 3. Adjustment to qualified stated interest for 
actual payment of interest_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, Z 
purchases at original issue, for $90,000, a variable rate debt 
instrument that matures on January 1, 1997, and has a stated 
principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt 
instrument provides for annual payments of interest on January 1 
of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The amount of 
interest payable is the value of annual LIBOR on the payment 
date. The value of annual LIBOR on January 1, 1995, and January 
1, 1996, is 5 percent, compounded annually. The value of annual 
LIBOR on January 1, 1997, is 7 percent, compounded annually. 
(ii) 

Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. 

Under paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section, the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument for the variable rate debt instrument is a 2-year debt 
instrument that has an issue price of $90,000 and a stated 
principal amount of $100,000. The equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument provides for interest payments of $5,000 at the end of 
each year. 
(iii) 

Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest. 

Under 
 1.1273-1, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has $10,000 
of OID and the annual interest payments of $5,000 are qualified 
stated interest payments. Under  1.1272-1, the equivalent fixed 
rate debt instrument has a yield of 10.82 percent, compounded 
annually. The amount of OID allocable to the first annual 
accrual period (assuming Z uses annual accrual periods) is 
$4,743.25 (($90,000  x  .1082) ^$5,000), and the amount of OID 
allocable to the second annual accrual period is $5,256.75 
($100,000 ^$94,743.25). Under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this 
section, the $2,000 difference between the $7,000 interest 
payment actually made at maturity and the $5,000 interest payment 
assumed to be made at maturity under the equivalent fixed rate 
debt instrument is treated as additional qualified stated 
interest for the period. 





(4) 

Variable rate debt instrument that provides for a single 
fixed rate_

(i) 

General rule. 

If a variable rate debt instrument 
provides for stated interest either at one or more qualified 
floating rates or at a qualified inverse floating rate and in 
addition provides for stated interest at a single fixed rate 
(other than an initial fixed rate described in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section), the amount of interest and OID are 
determined using the method of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, 
as modified by this paragraph (e)(4). For purposes of paragraphs 
(e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the variable rate 
debt instrument is treated as if it provided for a qualified 
floating rate (or a qualified inverse floating rate, if the debt 
instrument provides for a qualified inverse floating rate), 
rather than the fixed rate. The qualified floating rate (or 
qualified inverse floating rate) replacing the fixed rate must be 
such that the fair market value of the variable rate debt 
instrument as of the issue date would be approximately the same 
as the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt 
instrument that provides for the qualified floating rate (or 
qualified inverse floating rate) rather than the fixed rate.

(ii) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates the rule in 
paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. 











Example. Variable rate debt instrument that provides for a 
single fixed rate_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1995, X purchases at 
original issue, for $100,000, a variable rate debt instrument 
that matures on January 1, 2001, and that has a stated principal 
amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for payments of 
interest on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. 
For the first 4 years, the interest rate is 4 percent, compounded 
annually, and for the last 2 years the interest rate is the value 
of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, plus 200 basis points. 
On January 1, 1995, the value of 1-year LIBOR is 2 percent, 
compounded annually. In addition, assume that on January 1, 
1995, the variable rate debt instrument has approximately the 
same fair market value as an otherwise identical debt instrument 
that provides for an interest rate equal to the value of 1-year 
LIBOR, as of the payment date, for the first 4 years. 



(ii) 

Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. 

Under paragraph 
(e)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) 
through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the variable rate debt 
instrument is treated as if it provided for an interest rate 
equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, for 
the first 4 years. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, 
the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the variable rate 
debt instrument is a 6-year debt instrument that has an issue 
price and stated principal amount of $100,000. The equivalent 
fixed rate debt instrument provides for interest payments of 
$2,000 for the first 4 years and $4,000 for the last 2 years. 



(iii) 

Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest. 

Under 
 1.1273-1, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has OID of 
$4,000 because a portion (200 basis points) of each interest 
payment in the last 2 years is not a qualified stated interest 
payment. The $4,000 of OID is allocable over the 6-year term of 
the debt instrument under  1.1272-1. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) 
of this section, the difference between the $4,000 payment made 
in the first 4 years and the $2,000 payment assumed to be made on 
the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in those years is an 
adjustment to qualified stated interest. In addition, any 
difference between the amount actually paid in each of the last 2 
years and the $4,000 payment assumed to be made on the equivalent 
fixed rate debt instrument is an adjustment to qualified stated 
interest. 









(f) 

Special rule for certain reset bonds. 

Notwithstanding 
paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph (f) provides a 
special rule for a variable rate debt instrument that provides 
for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial interval, and 
provides that on the date immediately following the end of the 
initial interval (the effective date) the stated interest rate 
will be a rate determined under a procedure (such as an auction 
procedure) so that the fair market value of the instrument on the 
effective date will be a fixed amount (the reset value). Solely 
for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, the variable rate 
debt instrument is treated as_


(i) Maturing on the date immediately preceding the effective 
date for an amount equal to the reset value; and 



(ii) Reissued on the effective date for an amount equal to 
the reset value.

Debt Instruments with Original Issue Discount; Anti-Abuse Rule 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains a temporary regulation that adds an anti-abuse rule to the final regulations relating to the
tax treatment of debt instruments with original issue discount. The rule allows the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
in certain circumstances, to apply or depart from the final regulations in a manner that ensures a reasonable result
in light of the purposes of the statutes governing original issue discount. The text of this temporary regulation
also serves as the text of the proposed regulation set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in
the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Background 





Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the IRS published final regulations relating to original issue discount (OID) and other related matters under sections
163(e), 446, 483, 1001, 1012, and sections 1271 through 1275 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, the regulations
finalize the proposed regulations that were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1992 (57 FR 60750). 




Explanation of provision





The final regulations provide rules for the computation of OID and other related matters. In many cases, the final
regulations provide bright-line or mechanical rules to simplify computations and to permit flexibility in structuring
debt instruments. 



The Service and Treasury believe that the rules in the final regulations work appropriately in most situations. Nonetheless,
it may be possible to structure debt instruments or transactions, or to apply the bright-line or mechanical rules
of the regulations, in a way that produces an unreasonable result. The purpose of the temporary regulation is to allow
the Commissioner to apply or depart from the final regulations where necessary or appropriate to ensure that the tax
result is reasonable in light of the purposes of the applicable statutes. 



Under the temporary regulation, if a principal purpose in structuring a debt instrument, engaging in a transaction,
or applying the final regulations is to achieve a result that is unreasonable in light of the purposes of the applicable
statutes, then the Commissioner can apply or depart from the regulations as necessary or appropriate to achieve a
reasonable result. A result will not be considered unreasonable, however, in the absence of a substantial effect
on the present value of a taxpayer's tax liability. 




Special Analyses 





It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive
Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to this regulation, and, therefore, a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this temporary regulation
will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact
on small business. 




List of Subjects in 26 CFR part 1 





Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 



Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations 





Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows: 




PART 1_INCOME TAXES 







Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 1 is amended by adding an entry in numerical order to read as follows: 








Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *  1.1275-2T also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1275(d). 











Par. 2. 

Section 1.1275-2T is added to read as follows: 




 1.1275-2T

Special rules relating to debt instruments (temporary). 





(a) through (f) [Reserved] 



(g) 

Anti-abuse rule_

(1) 

In general. 

If a principal purpose in structuring a debt instrument, engaging in a transaction, or applying the regulations under
section 163(e) or sections 1271 through 1275 is to achieve a result that is unreasonable in light of the purposes of
the applicable statutes, then the Commissioner can apply or depart from the regulations as necessary or appropriate
to achieve a reasonable result. Whether a result is unreasonable is determined based on all the facts and circumstances.
A result will not be considered unreasonable, however, in the absence of a substantial effect on the present value
of a taxpayer's tax liability. For example, if a principal purpose of including an early call option that is not expected
to be exercised by the issuer in the terms of a current-pay, increasing-rate note is to protect the holder from taxable
income in excess of the interest payments by virtue of the option rules of  1.1272-1(c)(5), and if the effect
would be to substantially reduce the present value of a holder's tax liability arising from the note, the Commissioner
can apply the regulations (in whole or in part) without regard to the rules of  1.1272-1(c)(5). On the other
hand, it generally would be reasonable for a corporation to issue convertible bonds, rather than investment units
consisting of bonds and warrants, to reduce or eliminate the amount of taxable OID on the bonds. See  1.1272-1(e).




(2) 

Effective date. 

Paragraph (g) of this section applies to debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994, and to lending transactions,
sales, and exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994.

30 CFR 913.15, 913.16, and 913.17.



II. Submission of Amendment



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(b)(3), the Illinois regulatory authority notified OSM by letter dated August 17, 1993 (Administrative
Record No. IL-1500), of a proposed amendment to the Illinois program to incorporate statutory changes to the
State Act at 225 ILCS 720/2.11 and 6.01. The statutory changes were enacted through Public Act 88-63 (HB 2183)
and Public Act 88-185 (SB 632) and signed into law on July 7, 1993, and August 4, 1993, respectively.

By letter dated November 22, 1993, in response to an issue letter prepared by OSM on November 5, 1993, Illinois clarified
certain provisions of the proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. IL-1516).

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 8, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47237) and in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on October 8, 1993.

Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning
the proposed amendment to the Illinois program submitted on August 17, 1993. Revisions not addressed below involve
nonsubstantive working changes.



1. 225 ILCS 720/2.11_Procedures for Approval



(a) Illinois is proposing to make minor, non-substantive language changes at sections 2.11(a), (b), (c), and (g)
to clarify the provisions of these sections. The Director finds that the proposed revisions are in accordance with
section 514 of SMCRA.

(b) At section 2.11(c), Illinois is also proposing to prohibit any party to a formal adjudicatory hearing under this
subsection from seeking judicial review of the Department's final decision on the permit application until after
the issuance of the hearing officer's written decision granting or denying the permit. Additionally, notices of
permit decision hearings must be published seven to fourteen days before the hearing and comply with certain size
and placement requirements.

In a letter to OSM dated November 22, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IL-1516), Illinois clarified that: (a)
A permit applicant must seek administrative review prior to seeking judicial review under the provisions of section
2.11(f); (b) the provisions in section 2.11(c) pertaining to exhaustion of administrative remedies would not apply
to the hearing officer's final written decision for temporary relief under section 2.11(e); and (c) if the hearing
officer fails to act within prescribed time frames, judicial review of his failure to act is required per the implementing
provisions of 62 Ill. Admin. Code 1847.3(1)(2).

Although section 514(f) of SMCRA does not contain the provision proposed at section 2.11(c) pertaining to judicial
review, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 775.13(a)(2) provide for judicial review if a hearing or regulatory authority
fails to render a decision within the specified time limits. The Director finds that the proposed revision when read
in conjunction with 62 Illinois Administrative Code 1847.3(1)(2) is consistent with the Federal regulations at
30 CFR 775.13(a)(2).

Section 514(c) of SMCRA does not contain the provision proposed at section 2.11(c) pertaining to notices of permit
decision hearings. However, the Director finds the proposed revision in accordance with the requirements of section
514(c) of SMCRA.



2. 225ILCS 720/6.01_Requirement of a Bond



Illinois is proposing to add a provision at section 6.01(b) to permit the Department to accept the bond of the applicant,
without separate surety, when the applicant demonstrates to the Department's satisfaction the existence of a suitable
agent to receive service of process, a history of financial solvency and continuous operation, and a current financial
soundness sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond the required amount.

The Director finds that the new section 6.01(b) is not less stringent than the provisions of section 509(c) of SMCRA
to the extent that states are provided with the authority to establish self-bonding systems. However, prior to implementation
of this statutory amendment, the Director is requiring that Illinois submit and receive the approval by OSM of supporting
regulations to implement the self-bonding provisions of the statute.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing announced in the September 8, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47237) ended on October 8, 1993. No comments were received and the scheduled public hearing was not held since
no one requested an opportunity to provide testimony.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Illinois program. None were received.



EPA Concurrence



Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate
to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). Although the Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories, the EPA concurred
with the proposed amendment.



V. Director's Decision



Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the amendment to the Illinois regulatory program submitted
on August 17, 1993, with one condition specified in Finding 2.

The Federal rules at 30 CFR part 913 concerning the Illinois program are being amended to implement the Director's
decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and
to encourage States to conform their programs to the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and Federal
standards is required by SMCRA.



Effect of the Director's Decision



Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
his oversight of the Illinois program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Illinois of such provisions.



VI. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866



This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts
730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

Paperwork Reduction Act




This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.






Regulatory Flexibility Act




The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Pesticide Tolerances and Feed Additive Regulations for Clethodim




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes permanent tolerances for residues of the herbicide clethodim ((E)-(

#

)-2-[1-[[(3-chloro-2-propenyl)oxy]imino]propyl]-5-[2-(ethylthio)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one)
in or on various raw agricultural commodities and feed additive commodities. These regulations were requested by
Valent USA Corp. and establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the herbicide in or on the commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62075), EPA issued a proposed rule to establish permanent tolerances under section 408
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a), for residues of the herbicide clethodim and its metabolites
containing the 2-cyclohexen-1-one moiety in or on various raw agricultural commodities (40 CFR 180.458) and in or
on various feed additive commodities (40 CFR 186.1075). Interim tolerances had been established in the 

Federal Register

 of January 29, 1992 (57 FR 3296). These tolerances were requested by Valent U.S.A. Corp., 1333 N. California Blvd.,
Suite 600, Walnut Creek, CA 95496, and establish the maximum permissible level for residues of the herbicide on these
commodities. 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by these regulations may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that these rules are not ``significant'' and are therefore
not subject to OMB review.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Adult Assistance Programs Income and Resources Disregards



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These final rules update the statutory disregards in regulations for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) program, and the adult assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands by adding the income
and resources disregards provided under several public laws. The disregards are: (1) Section 479B of the Higher Education
Act of 1965, as amended by Public Law 102-325, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, which provides that student
financial assistance received under the programs in title IV of the Higher Education Act, or under Bureau of Indian
Affairs student assistance programs, will not be taken into account in determining need or amount of benefits; (2)
section 501(c) of Public Law 101-392, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments
of 1990, which provides that student financial assistance made for attendance costs will not be counted as income
or resources; (3) section 105 of Public Law 100-383, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provides that restitution
made to individuals of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World War II will not be counted as income or resources,
and section 206 of Public Law 100-383, the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Restitution Act, which provides that
restitution made to Aleuts who were relocated by the United States government during World War II will not be counted
as income or resources; (4) section 105 of Public Law 100-707, the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Amendments of 1988, which provides that major disaster and emergency assistance will not be counted as income or resources;
(5) section 1(a) of Public Law 101-201 and section 10405 of Public Law 101-239, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1989, which both provide that Agent Orange payments will not be counted as income or resources; and (6) section
6(h)(2) of Public Law 101-426, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which provides that amounts paid pursuant
to this Act will not be counted as income and resources.



These final rules also amend the existing regulations to provide that bona fide loans will not be counted as income
or resources.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



On July 15, 1991, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 relating to updating the statutory disregards in regulations for the AFDC program, and adult assistance programs
in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 



Discussion of Regulatory Provisions and Responses to Comments 



The final rules implement the disregard provisions of several public laws and revise existing regulations to require
the disregard of bona fide loans as discussed below: 



Disregard of Student Financial Assistance Provided Under the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Carl D.
Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act 



Higher Education Amendments of 1992 



Public Law 102-325, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, enacted July 23, 1992, amends the Higher Education
Act of 1965. Effective July 1, 1993, section 471(a) of Public Law 102-325 revises section 479B to provide that
any student financial assistance received under programs in title IV of the Higher Education Act, or under Bureau
of Indian Affairs student assistance programs, shall be disregarded in determining the need or eligibility of any
person for benefits or assistance, or the amount of such benefits or assistance, under any Federal, State, or local
programs financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. 

Some examples of student financial assistance authorized by title IV of the Higher Education Act are: the Pell Grant
Program, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Program, the National Direct Student Loan (NDSL)
Program, the PLUS Program, the Byrd Honor Scholarship Programs and the College Work Study Program. 

We are adding a new  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

p

) to implement Public Law 102-325.

Since the regulatory changes related to section 479B of the Higher Education Act do not involve administrative discretion,
but simply implement statutory requirements, we believe that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), good cause exists for
waiver of a notice of proposed rulemaking on the grounds that it is not necessary. 

In the NPRM, we proposed to include in regulations the disregard authorized by the former section 479B, as added by
section 14(27) of Public Law 100-50. The former section 479B limited the disregard to student financial assistance
made available for the attendance costs defined in that section. Child care and living expenses were not defined as
attendance costs. Therefore, we proposed that assistance for such costs would not be disregarded under this regulation
unless the educational institution provided for them as part of miscellaneous personal expenses. 

We received comments from three State agencies, one County agency, and one legal advocacy group on the proposed rule.
The comments are discussed below: 



Comment: 

The commenters recommended that we disregard all of the educational assistance, including amounts provided for
child care and living expenses, because counting any part of the educational assistance may inflate State error rates
and may be a severe disincentive to the continuation of post-secondary education.

<PARENT> FR940202-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Effective July 1, 1993, a new statutory amendment eliminated the limitations on the disregard. Therefore, we have
changed the regulation to implement the new statutory requirement that all student financial assistance received
under programs in title IV of the Higher Education Act or under Bureau of Indian Affairs educational assistance programs
will be disregarded as income and resources.


Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990


Public Law 101-392, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990,
enacted September 25, 1990, substantially amended the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education
Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 

et seq.

) by authorizing grants to States and Indian Tribes to carry out various vocational education assistance programs.
Section 221(a)(1) authorizes the use of certain funds to provide, subsidize, reimburse, or pay for preparatory services,
including instruction in basic academic and occupational skills, necessary educational materials, and career
guidance and counseling services, in preparation for vocational education and training that will furnish single
parents, displaced homemakers, and single pregnant women with marketable skills.
Section 507(a) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act specifies that the portion
of any student financial assistance received under this Act that is made available for attendance costs defined in
section 507(b) of the Act shall not be considered as income or resources in determining eligibility for assistance
under any other program funded in whole or in part with Federal funds.
Under section 507(b), attendance costs are defined as:
(1) Tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same academic workload as determined by the institution,
and including costs for rental or purchase or any equipment, materials, or supplies required of all students in the
same course of study; and
(2) An allowance for books, supplies, transportation, dependent care and miscellaneous personal expenses for a
student attending the institution on at least a half-time basis, as determined by the institution.
Living expenses are not designated as attendance costs under section 507(b). Therefore, such expenses will be disregarded
only when they are provided as part of miscellaneous personal expenses.
Further, section 507 of Public Law 90-575, the Higher Education Amendments of 1968, and implementing regulations
at  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

d

) require that any grant or loan to an undergraduate student for educational purposes made or insured under any program
administered by the Department of Education will be disregarded as income and resources in programs under titles
I, IV, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), or XIX of the Social Security Act.
The combined effect of section 507 of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act and section
507 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1968 is as follows:
(1) Educational loans and grants provided to undergraduate students under any programs administered by the Department
of Education, except those in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, will not be counted
as income or resources for purposes of the AFDC and adult assistance programs; and
(2) Educational assistance provided for attendance costs under programs in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Education Act will not be counted as income or resources for purposes of the AFDC and adult assistance programs.

We are revising the regulations at  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

d

) and adding a new  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

t

) to implement section 501(c) of Public Law 101-392. In this connection, it should be noted that these regulations
do not preclude the disregard of educational assistance under any other applicable disregard, e.g., the disregard
of bona fide loans or complementary assistance.

Since the regulatory changes related to section 501(c) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education
Act do not involve administrative discretion, but simply implement statutory requirements, we believe that, under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), good cause exists for waiver of a notice of proposed rulemaking on the grounds that it is no necessary.



Disregard of Payments Provided Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Restitution
Act



Civil Liberties Act of 1988



Title I of Public Law 100-383, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, provides that restitution shall be made to the
United States citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World War II.

Section 105 of Public Law 100-383 provides that the Attorney General shall pay to each eligible individual the
sum of $20,000. If the eligible individual is deceased, the payment will be made to the eligible individual's spouse,
children or parents. Section 105(f)(2) provides that the amount of such payments shall not be counted as income or
resources for purposes of determining eligibility to receive benefits described in section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title
31, United States Code, or the amount of such benefits.



Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Restitution Act



Title II of Public Law 100-383, the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Restitution Act, provides that restitution
shall be made to any Aleut living on the date of the enactment of Public Law 100-383 (August 10, 1988) who, as a civilian,
was relocated by authority of the United States from his or her home village on the Pribilof Islands or the Aleutian
Islands west of Unimak Island to an internment camp, or other temporary facility or location during World War II, or
who was born while his or her natural mother was subject to such relocation.

Section 206 of Public Law 100-383 provides that the Secretary of the Interior shall pay to each eligible Aleut
the sum of $12,000. Section 206(d)(2) of Public Law 100-383 provides that the amount of such payments shall not
be counted as income or resources for purposes of determining eligibility to receive benefits described in section
3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code, or the amount of such benefits.

Section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code, contains a list of various Federal and federally-assisted
programs, including, among others, the AFDC program. However, the list does not include the adult assistance programs
under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act. Therefore, the disregards required by sections 105(f)(2)
and 206(d)(2) of Public Law 100-383 do not apply to the adult assistance programs administered in Guam, Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands.

There were no comments on these provisions. Thus, a new  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

g

) implements the provisions as proposed.



Disregard of Major Disaster and Emergency Assistance



Title I of Public Law 100-707, the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988, enacted November
23, 1988, amended the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C.   5121-5202) to provide for more effective
assistance in response to major disasters and emergencies.

Section 105 of Public Law 100-707 provides that Federal major disaster and emergency assistance provided to
individuals and families under this Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided by States, local governments,
and disaster assistance organizations, shall not be considered as income or resources when determining eligibility
for or benefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource-tested benefit programs.

Section 103 of Public Law 100-707 defines an emergency to mean any occasion or instance for which, in the determination
of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives
and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of
the United States.

Section 103 defines a major disaster to mean any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high
water, winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm,
or drought), or regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination
of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under the
Disaster Relief Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster
relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering caused thereby.

Disregard of Agent Orange Payments



In the In Re Agent Orange product liability case, M.D.L. No. 381 (E.D.N.Y.), several corporations which manufactured
the chemical Agent Orange agreed to pay $180 million into a settlement fund. Under the settlement, military personnel
who were exposed to the chemical Agent Orange while in Vietnam and who now suffer from total disabilities caused by
any disease, and survivors of deceased veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, are eligible for settlement payments.

Section 1 of Public Law 101-201, enacted December 6, 1989, specifies that, effective January 1, 1989, the payments
made from the Agent Orange Settlement Fund or any other fund pursuant to the settlement in connection with the case
In Re Agent Orange product liability litigation, M.D.L. No. 381 (E.D.N.Y.), shall not be considered income or resources
in determining eligibility for or the amount of benefits under any Federal or federally assisted programs.

Section 10405 of Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19, 1989, also specifies that, effective January 1, 1989,
payments from the Agent Orange settlement fund or any other fund established pursuant to the settlement shall not
be considered income or resources in determining eligibility for or the amount of benefits under certain specified
Federal or federally assisted programs including, among others, AFDC (title IV-A of the Social Security Act)
and the adult assistance programs (titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Act).

There were no comments on the proposed rule. Thus, a new  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

s

) implements these provisions as proposed.



Disregard of Payments Made Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act



Public Law 101-426, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, enacted October 15, 1990, establishes a program
to compensate individuals for injuries or deaths resulting from the exposure to radiation from nuclear testing and
uranium mining.

The law authorizes a $100 million trust fund from which payments will be made. Payments may be made until the earlier
of the date on which the $100 million, and any income earned on this amount, is expended or 22 years after the law was enacted.

Individuals who were injured due to exposure to radiation from nuclear testing will receive $50,000 each. Individuals
who were injured due to exposure to radiation while employed as uranium miners will receive $100,000 each. When the
affected individual is deceased, payments will be made to the surviving spouse, children, parents, grandchildren
or grandparents.

Section 6(h)(2) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act provides that amounts paid to an individual pursuant
to this law will not be included as income or resources for purposes of determining eligibility to receive benefits
described in section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code, or the amount of such benefits.

Section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code contains a list of various Federal and federally-assisted
programs including, among others, the AFDC program. However, the list does not include the adult assistance programs
under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act. Therefore, the disregards required by section 6(h)(2)
of Public Law 101-426 do not apply to the adult assistance programs administered in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands. Action Transmittal FSA-AT-91-5, dated February 25, 1991, notified the States
of the requirements of Public Law 101-426 to disregard, for purposes of the AFDC program, compensation received
by individuals, or upon death by the spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, or grandparents, for injuries sustained
by such individuals due to the exposure to radiation from nuclear testing or uranium mining.

We are adding a new  233.20(a)(4)(ii)(

u

) to implement this provision.

Since the regulatory changes related to section 6(h)(2) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, Public Law 101-426,
do not involve administrative discretion, but simply implement the statutory requirements, we believe that, under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) good cause exists for waiver of a notice of proposed rulemaking on the grounds that it is not necessary.



Disregard of Bona Fide Loans



Section 223.20(a)(3)(iv)(B) of the existing regulations states that, in determining the availability of income
and resources, loans which are obtained and used under conditions that preclude their use to meet current living costs
will not be counted as income. Under this regulation, loans that are available to meet current living expenses are
considered countable income.

However, because of an adverse court decision in the case of 

Mangrum 

v. 

Griepentrog 

v. 

Bowen, 

702 F. Supp. 813 (D. Nev. 1988), the Department of Health and Human Services issued Information Memorandum FSA-IM-89-1,
dated January 3, 1989. The Information Memorandum permits States the option to disregard bona fide loans as income
and resources. Between January and June 1989, 45 States implemented the option.

These final regulations amend the policy on treatment of loans to require that States disregard bona fide loans from
any source and for any purpose as income and resources in the determination of eligibility and the amount of benefits
under the AFDC and adult assistance programs.

The amendment is based on the principles discussed in the Mangrum court decision. The court stated, with respect to
counting loans as income, that the essential characteristic of a loan is that it must be repaid. This duty to repay distinguishes
loans from wages, personal injury awards, gifts, child support payments and all other forms of income. Since the borrower
must repay the loan principal in its entirety (and possibly with interest), the loan principal may not be income for
AFDC purposes.

Although the issue in Mangrum was counting loans as income, the court also addressed treatment of loans as resources.
The court cited the decision in 

National Welfare Rights Organization

 v. 

Mathews,

 533 F. 2d. 637 (DC Cir. 1976), and interpreted that decision to mean that the actual value of an item, whether it is a financial
instrument or personal property, is its fair market value, less its encumbrances, that is, its equity value. The court
stated that since loans must be repaid, they are totally encumbered and have no equity value. Accordingly, it is also
not appropriate to treat the loan principal as a resource under the AFDC program.

The proposed rule stated that funds would be considered a bona fide loan when an applicant or recipient submits to the
State agency one of several types of documents to verify that funds were provided with the expectation of repayment
so that a legal debt exists.

We received comments on this provision from six State agencies and two legal advocacy groups. The comments are discussed
below:



Comment:

 All the commenters expressed support for the disregard of bona fide loans as income and resources. However, most of
the commenters recommended that we expand the definition of a bona fide loan to include oral contracts because oral
contracts are recognized as valid under Federal and State law. The commenters also recommended that we remove specific
language requiring a written document and allow States to use a process which will exempt loans if there is an understanding
that the money will be repaid and the borrower can reasonably explain how the loan will be repaid.



Response:

 In view of the comments, we have decided to allow each State to determine what constitutes a bona fide loan. This approach
will provide the recommended flexibility for States to establish objective and reasonable criteria for determining
that a bona fide loan exists. Therefore, the final regulation will require that each State include in its State plan
criteria for identifying a bona fide loan.



Comment:

 Two commenters stated that the income of a self-employed person consists of the total profit_defined as the comparison
of gross receipts with business expenses. The commenters recommended that we amend the regulations at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(6)(v)(B)
to define payments on business loans as business expenses for the purposes of determining the profit from a business.
They also suggested that we amend the regulations to disregard any profits derived from loans on a business enterprise
which are kept in a separate account that is used for the business.



Response:

 This comment is outside the scope of this rulemaking. Therefore, we are not addressing it as part of this final regulation.



Comment:

 Two commenters requested that we amend the regulations to clarify that only the principal of a loan can be disregarded,
and the disregard does not extend to interest earned on a loan or purchases made with the proceeds of a loan.

Response:

 We agree. To clarify that only the principal of a loan can be disregarded, the final regulation provides that the disregard
does not extend to interest earned on a loan while held by the borrower, or purchases made with the proceeds of a loan.
Consistent with the general AFDC policy for the treatment of interest earned on bank accounts, the final rule also
provides that interest earned on the proceeds of a loan while held in a savings account, checking account or other financial
instrument will be counted as unearned income in the month received and as a resource thereafter.

Accordingly, we have revised the regulation at  233.20(a)(3)(iv)(B) and added a new  233.20(a)(3)(xxi)
to implement this policy.



Regulatory Procedures



Executive Order 12291



These regulations have been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and do not meet any of the criteria for a major regulation.
Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required because these regulations will not: (1) Have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) impose a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,
Federal, State or local government agencies or geographic regions; or (3) result in significant adverse effects
on competition, employment, investment, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete
with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not require any information collection activities and, therefore, no approvals are necessary under
the Paperwork Reduction Act.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these final rules is
on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these regulations will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affect individuals and States. Thus, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required.

Licensing of Pilots; Manning of Vessels by Pilots 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending the regulations concerning the licensing of pilots and the manning of vessels by pilots.
This interim final rule: Defines ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' for pilotage purposes; describes first class pilotage
areas where local pilotage expertise is warranted; allows licensed individuals to serve as pilots in areas not identified
as first class pilotage areas on vessels that they are otherwise qualified to control; requires a Federal pilot for
vessels in excess of 1,600 gross tons, propelled by machinery and subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. chapter 33,
that are not authorized by their Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line; and provides quick
reference tables for Federal pilotage requirements. These changes are necessary to eliminate confusion over where
and on what vessels pilotage expertise is required.

Background and Purpose



Normally, foreign vessels and U.S. vessels operating on registry endorsement are under State pilotage authority,
and U.S. vessels operating on coastwise endorsement are under Federal pilotage authority. The regulations addressed
in this rulemaking deal only with Federal pilotage.

A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published June 24, 1985 (50 FR 26117), addressing unresolved pilotage
issues. The comment period was originally scheduled to end on September 23, 1985, however, a notice of extension of
comment period (50 FR 38557), published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 23, 1985, extended the comment period to December 22, 1985. In response to this notice, the Coast Guard
received 172 written comments, and held two public meetings. One public meeting was held in New York, hosted by the
Maritime Association of New York, on November 12, 1985. The second was a meeting of the Towing Safety Advisory Committee
Subcommittee on Personnel Manning and Licensing, which was held at Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, DC, on
December 12, 1985. On June 6, 1988, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM)
(53 FR 20654) addressing the comments received in response to the NPRM and public meetings. The comment period for
the SNPRM ended September 6, 1988. Sixteen written comments were received regarding the 1988 SNPRM. These comments
included several recommendations by the Towing Safety Advisory Committee (TSAC).

The length of time between the publication of the SNPRM and this rule has been unusually long because of developments
associated with the grounding of the M/V EXXON VALDEZ and the subsequent enactment of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.

Therefore, the Coast Guard is publishing this rule as an interim final rule as opposed to a final rule in order to provide
the public another opportunity to comment.

As a result of the derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited passenger train at Big Bayou Canot, Alabama on September
22, 1993, the Coast Guard established a task force to review, among other issues, the adequacy and effectiveness of
the licensing requirements for operators of uninspected towing vessels. There is no statutory or regulatory pilotage
requirement for the particular tug and barge combination that may have collided with the bridge prior to the derailment,
and neither the proposed rules nor this interim rule have any applicability to these vessels. The proximate cause
of the incident is yet undetermined and is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
The NTSB is expected to make recommendations as a result of their investigation but these recommendations are not
expected to have any impact on this rule.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



The vast majority of the comments received in response to the 1988 SNPRM dealt with two issues: (1) The grandfathering
provision for individuals with prior towing experience; and (2) the definition of a ``coastwise seagoing vessel.''

Regarding the grandfathering provision, the 1988 SNPRM proposed permitting individuals ``with 5 years service
on towing vessel combinations of at least 5,000 gross tons while acting under the authority of a license as master,
mate, or operator of uninspected towing vessels, with a minimum of 2 of the 5 years having been on towing vessel combinations
of at least 10,000 gross tons, to obtain without a written examination, an endorsement as first class pilot, restricted
to tug and barge combinations, for those routes over which they have made the required number of round trips.'' The
intent of this proposal was to allow those who have demonstrated their abilities to pilot tug and barge combinations
to obtain a restricted endorsement as first class pilot without completing a written examination.

The Coast Guard received a number of comments supporting this proposal. However, the Coast Guard also received comments
in opposition to this grandfathering provision, indicating that the Coast Guard should not issue a pilot's license
to an individual unless that individual passed the written examination. 

A number of significant events have occurred since the 1988 SNPRM. There have been several major vessel casualties,
the most notable of which was the EXXON VALDEZ. Pilotage issues and requirements played a prominent part in the EXXON
VALDEZ investigation. Following the EXXON VALDEZ casualty in 1989, Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act of 1990
(OPA 90), which includes provisions regarding pilotage.

As a result of these events, the Coast Guard believes that it is inappropriate and not in the best interest of navigational
safety to issue a first class pilot's license or endorsement without requiring a written examination, including
a chart sketch. Therefore, the grandfathering provision is not adopted in this interim final rule. 

The other major issue in the 1988 SNPRM which received comments was the definition of a ``coastwise seagoing vessel''
contained in 46 U.S.C. 8502. The SNPRM definition of the term ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' made the distinction
between a vessel authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to make voyages only on U.S. internal waters and a vessel
authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to make voyages beyond the Boundary Line. 

The 1988 SNPRM considered a coastwise seagoing vessel as a vessel that is authorized by its Certificate of Inspection
to proceed beyond the Boundary Line. Some comments supported this definition. However, other comments and recommendations
from TSAC did not support this definition, suggesting that pilotage requirements for coastwise seagoing vessels
should be at least partially tied to the voyage on which the vessel is engaged. Those comments and recommendations
urged the following definition: ``A coastwise seagoing vessel, for purposes of the manning of vessels by pilots or
for individuals acting as pilots, means a vessel authorized by its Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the
Boundary Line, and whose movement in pilotage waters relates to a voyage in which the vessel has or will cross the Boundary
Line.'' 

The Coast Guard is adopting the proposal published in the June 6, 1988 SNPRM, i.e., that a coastwise seagoing vessel
for pilotage purposes is one that is authorized by its Coast Guard issued Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond
the Boundary Line. The Coast Guard did not adopt the alternative proposal because that definition would have enabled
coastwise seagoing vessels to make voyages without a pilot within the internal waters of the United States, including
those waters where most hazards to navigation are encountered. Adopting the alternative proposal would have reduced
pilotage requirements by requiring fewer vessels to use a pilot, permitting more vessels to make extensive movements
within harbors or between ports without the services of a pilot in the exact waters where pilotage can be most beneficial.

Besides the ``grandfathering provision,'' and the definition of a ``coastwise seagoing vessel,'' the other changes
which were proposed in the 1988 SNPRM did not receive any substantial comments or criticisms. Therefore, the other
changes proposed in the 1988 SNPRM are adopted in this rule. These other changes include: (1) Describing first class
pilotage areas where local pilotage expertise is warranted; (2) allowing licensed individuals to serve as pilots
in areas not identified as first class pilotage areas on vessels that they are otherwise qualified to control; and
(3) requiring a Federal pilot for vessels in excess of 1,600 gross tons, propelled by machinery and subject to inspection
under 46 U.S.C. chapter 33, that are not authorized by their Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary
Line. In addition, quick reference tables for Federal pilotage requirements are also being adopted.



Regulatory Evaluation



This interim final rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is significant under the
Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). However, the
Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this interim final rule to be so minimal that further Regulatory Evaluation
is unnecessary.

This rule defines ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' for pilotage purposes, describes first class pilotage areas where
local pilotage expertise is warranted, and provides quick reference tables for pilotage requirements. Additionally,
this rule clarifies that a Federal pilot is required for vessels in excess of 1,600 gross tons, propelled by machinery
and subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. chapter 33, that are not authorized by their Certificate of Inspection to
proceed beyond the Boundary Line.

This rule codifies current practices. The Coast Guard anticipates that the rule will not increase crew size or require
increased use of pilots since, for the most part, vessels affected by this rule are presently required by their Certificate
of Inspection to use a Federal pilot. Thus, the Coast Guard believes that further evaluation is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this interim final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The small entities that could be affected by this interim final rule are primarily independent
operators of tank barges and self-propelled vessels. Since this rule, for the most part, adopts current practices,
the Coast Guard believes that there will be no significant economic impact on ``small entities.'' Therefore, because
it expects the economic impact of this interim final rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.




Collection of Information



This interim final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44
U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and has determined that this interim final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This rule does not affect existing State pilotage requirements, but
instead clarifies the Federal pilotage requirements for those vessels which, under 46 U.S.C. 8502, are exclusively
subject to Federal pilotage.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this interim final rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
The rule, which clarifies Federal pilotage requirements, is administrative in nature since, by codifying existing
practices, it permits vessels to continue to operate according to current industry practice. Therefore, this is
included in the categorical exclusion in subsection 2.B.2.1, ``Administrative actions or procedural regulations
and policies which clearly do not have any environmental impact.'' A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been
placed in the docket.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final Rules. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ICC is issuing final rules permitting carriers to effectuate range tariffs by filing by fax the actual rates applicable
to identified shipments prior to transport of those shipments. Section 5(b) of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 requires
that, as of June 1, 1994, range tariffs must identify the specific rate or discount (from among the range of available
rates or discounts) which applies to each specific shipment, or must contain an objective means for determining that
rate. Faxed rates, which are intended for use only where carriers must respond rapidly to changing market demands
in the spot market, will have an effective period of only 7 days. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rules on August 9, 1993 at 58 FR 42276. Additional information concerning
the final rules that are adopted is contained in the Commission's decision. To purchase a copy of the full decision,
write to, call, or pick up in person from: Dynamic Concepts, Inc., Room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building,
Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 289-4357/4359. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available
through TDD services (202) 927-5721.] 


Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


No one has challenged our initial conclusion that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. We reaffirm this conclusion for the reasons previously cited, i.e., that the economic impact
will be minimal because the regulation merely provides for another means by which carriers may submit to the agency
certain materials already required by statute to be filed with the agency. Thus, the economic impact is unlikely to
be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Environmental Statement 


This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources.

5. A new  1312.41 is added to read as follows: 


 1312.41 

Range tariffs. 


(a) A range tariff presents a series of rates or discounts with each rate or discount potentially applicable to any
given shipment; the particular rate or discount made applicable to particular shipment(s) is given effect by the
filing of a second tariff. Under these circumstances the rate or discount made applicable by the filing of the second
tariff takes precedence over other filed tariffs otherwise applicable to the shipment(s). 
(b) To 

initiate

 range tariff pricing, a carrier or agent shall: 
(1) File with the Commission a tariff setting forth the series (range) of rates or discounts potentially applicable
to shipments moving on, or subsequent to, the effective date of the tariff. The tariff shall show on its title page the
term INITIATING RANGE TARIFF; 
(2) Provide an explanation of the application of the tariff, including any conditions, limitations or restrictions
that attend use of the tariff; the explanation shall be contained in an Item 150 designated ``Application of Tariff'';

(3) File not more than one initiating range tariff to be in effect at any one time; however, different ranges of rates
or discounts may be established within the one tariff provided the application of the different ranges is clearly
explained to avoid ambiguity of applicability; 
(4) File initiating range tariffs with the Commission in the manner required by  1312.3 and  1312.4(a)
and (b) of this part; and 
(5) Establish and maintain with the Commission a tariff filing fee account pursuant to the provisions of  1002.2(a)(1)(ii)
of this chapter, for use in making activating range tariff filings under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(c) To activate for particular shipment(s) a particular rate or discount (from among the range of rates or discounts
provided in the initiating range tariff established under paragraph (b) of this section), a carrier or agent shall:

(1) Prior to transporting a specifically identified shipment(s), file a tariff with the Commission stating the actual
rate or discount that applies to the shipment(s). The tariff shall show on its title page the term ACTIVATING RANGE
TARIFF and shall refer to the initiating range tariff (previously established under paragraph (b) of this section)
as a control tariff; 
(2) Publish activating rates or discounts in a tariff in the carrier's own name or in a tariff filed in the name of a duly
authorized agent, immediately followed by the carrier's or agent's code and the characters ``6R''; immediately
under this designation shall be shown the actual date of filing with the Commission, which shall serve as the date on
which the tariff becomes applicable for traffic moving subsequent to the filing. 



Example: ICC ABCD 6R 
Filed: 7/1/93 



Each page of the activating range tariff shall show this same information. Each page shall be sequentially numbered
with the final page stating ``end'' following the last page number; 


(3) Show on the title page of each activating range tariff a specific date of expiration that shall not exceed 7 days
from the date of the tariff's filing. In the event an expiration date is not designated, the tariff shall expire 7 days
from the date of filing; 
(4) Identify the specific traffic to be accorded service under the stated rate or discount with whatever information
is needed to identify specifically the intended shipments, but in any event, at a minimum, identify either the shipper's
name or the commodity description and origin and destination points; and 
(5) File with the Commission: 
(i) One copy of each activating tariff submitted by fax transmission to (202) 927-5888; to avoid the necessity
of filing a separate transmittal letter (see  1312.4(b) of this part), the title page of every activating range
tariff shall provide the name, title and phone number of the party authorized to submit the publication for filing
with the Commission, and the fee account number established for the filing carrier or agent; or 
(ii) Two copies of each activating tariff transmitted by hand in accordance with the requirements of  1312.3
and 1312.4(a) and (b) of this part. 
(d) Except as expressly provided in this section, range tariffs are subject to the provisions of   1312.1
through 1312.40 of this part. 



Decided: January 10, 1994. 



By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Simmons, Commissioners Phillips, and Philbin. Commissioner

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Critical Habitat for the Least Bell's Vireo 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus),
an endangered species, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This designation encompasses
a total of about 38,000 acres at 10 localities in portions of 6 counties in southern California. This designation results
in additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act for activities that are funded, authorized, or carried
out by a Federal agency. The Service has considered economic and other relevant impacts in making a final decision
on the size and scope of critical habitat. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 




Introduction 




The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable concurrently
with listing a species as endangered or threatened. On November 8, 1979, the Service received a petition from James
M. Greaves to list the Arizona (

V. b. arizonae

) and least Bell's vireos as endangered. A notice of acceptance of the petition and status review was published on February
6, 1980 (45 FR 8030). Based on the best scientific and commercial data available and comments submitted during the
status review, the Service found that the petitioned action was warranted for the least Bell's vireo on October 13,
1983 (49 FR 2485, January 20, 1984); however, a listing action was precluded by other pending listing actions of higher
priority, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C.
1531 

et seq

.). Section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) recycles such petitions, resulting in a new finding deadline of October 13, 1984. A finding
was made on October 12, 1984, that this action was still warranted but precluded. The Service published a proposed
rule to determine the least Bell's vireo to be an endangered species, and to designate critical habitat for the species
on May 3, 1985 (50 FR 18968). This proposed rule constituted the next finding required under section 4(b)(3)(B)(ii)
of the Act. A correction to some of the legal descriptions of the proposed critical habitat was published in the June
4, 1985, 

Federal Register

 (50 FR 23458). Rather than delay protected status for the vireo while the economic analysis that must accompany the
final rule designating critical habitat was being prepared, the Service decided to make final only the listing portion
of the rule to provide the Act's protection to the least Bell's vireo. Section 4(b)(6)(c)(ii) of the Act allows the
Service to postpone designation of critical habitat for up to 12 months. On May 2, 1986, the vireo was listed as endangered
and the comment period on proposed designation of critical habitat was reopened for an additional 90 days (51 FR 16483).
A further extension of the comment period to January 1, 1987, was published on July 31, 1986 (51 FR 27429). A revised
proposed rule was published on August 7, 1992 (57 FR 34892) at which time the public comment period was reopened for
90 days.

Definition of Critical Habitat



Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: (i) The specific areas within the geographical area occupied
by a species on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species
and (II) that may require special management considerations or protection, and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical
area occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon determination that such areas are essential for the conservation
of the species. Section 3(5)(C) further indicates that in most cases, critical habitat should not encompass the entire
geographical area that can be occupied by the species.



Role in Species Conservation



The term ``conservation,'' as defined in section 3 of the Act, means to use and the use of all methods and procedures
which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided
pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary (i.e., the species has recovered).

The definition of critical habitat, while explicitly mentioning the features essential to conservation of a species,
implicitly requires that the areas themselves be essential to the species' survival and recovery. Not all areas containing
those features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to its conservation. Conversely, areas not
currently containing all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may be designated
as critical habitat. However, areas not included in critical habitat that contain one or more of the essential features
are also important to the species' conservation and would be addressed under other facets of the Act and other conservation
laws and regulations.



Relationship to Recovery



Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and
threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section 3(3) of
the Act defines conservation to include all measures needed to recover the species and justify its removal from the
list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through
different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to further the purposes of the Act by carrying
out conservation programs and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the continued existence
of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat); section
9 (prohibition of taking of listed animal species); section 10 (wildlife research permits and conservation planning
on State and private lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants); land acquisition; and research.

Recovery planning under section 4(f) of the Act is the ``umbrella'' that eventually guides all of these activities
and promotes a species' conservation and eventual delisting. Recovery plans provide guidance, which may include
population goals and identification of areas in need of protection or special management, so that a species can be
removed from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Recovery plans usually include management
recommendations for areas proposed or designated as critical habitat.

The Service considers the conservation of a species in its designation of critical habitat. The designation of critical
habitat will not, in itself, lead to the recovery of the species, but is one of several measures available to contribute
to the conservation of a species. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying areas that
contain essential habitat features (primary constituent elements) that may require special management. The protection
given critical habitat under section 7 also immediately increases the protection given to these primary constituent
elements and essential areas and preserves options for the long-term conservation of the species. The protection
of these areas may also shorten the time needed to achieve recovery.

Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan; it does not establish numerical population goals;
it does not prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside of critical habitat); and it has no direct effect
on areas not designated. Specific management recommendations for critical habitat are more appropriately addressed
in recovery plans and in section 7 consultation. Areas outside of critical habitat also have an important role in the
conservation of a listed species that is not addressed through designation of critical habitat.

The designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised at any time that new information indicates that
changes are warranted. The Service will reassess proposals for designation of critical habitat if land management
plans, recovery plans, or other conservation strategies are developed and fully implemented that may reduce the
need for the additional protection provided by any critical habitat designation.



Primary Constituent Elements



The Service is required to base critical habitat designations on the best scientific data available (50 CFR 424.12).
In determining what areas are to be designated as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological
attributes that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management considerations
or protection. Such requirements, as stated in 50 CFR 424.12, include, but are not limited to, the following:




 Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;

 Food, water, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;

 Cover or shelter;

 Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and generally; and

 Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological
distribution of a species.




The Service has determined that the physical and biological habitat features (referred to as the primary constituent
elements) that support feeding, nesting, roosting and sheltering are essential to the conservation of the least
Bell's vireo. These habitat features can be described as riparian woodland vegetation that generally contains both
canopy and shrub layers, and includes some associated upland habitats. Vireos meet their survival and reproductive
needs (food, cover, nest sites, nestling and fledgling protection) within the riparian zone in most areas. In some
areas they also forage in adjacent upland habitats.



Ecological Considerations



The least Bell's vireo is a small gray migratory songbird that has declined dramatically in both numbers and distribution.
This subspecies was once widespread and abundant throughout the Central Valley and other low elevation riverine
areas of California. Least Bell's vireos historically bred in riparian woodlands from the interior of northern California
(near Red Bluff, Tehama County) to northwestern Baja California, Mexico. Its current breeding distribution is restricted
to a few localities in southern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico (Franzreb 1989).

Least Bell's vireos nest primarily in willows (

Salix 

spp.) but also use a variety of other shrub and tree species for nest placement (Gray and Greaves 1984, Salata 1987).
Least Bell's vireos forage in riparian and adjoining upland habitats (Salata 1983, Kus and Miner 1987). Preliminary
studies of vireo foraging behavior along the Santa Ynez River and within the Mono Creek Basin (Santa Barbara County)
indicated that a large percentage of their foraging may occur in the adjacent chaparral community up to 300 or more
yards from the nest (Tom Keeney, biologist, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, July 31, 1985). 

The reduction of least Bell's vireo numbers and distribution is associated with widespread loss of riparian habitats
and brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (

Molothrus ater

). Destruction or significant alteration of riparian woodlands may have rendered the least Bell's vireo population
incapable of withstanding the increase in brown-headed cowbird numbers that began in the 1920's (Grinnell and Miller
1944, Gaines 1974). 

The population decline of the vireo has been well documented. In 1973, no least Bell's vireos were found during an intensive
search in nearly all remaining riparian habitat between Red Bluff, Tehama County, and Stockton, San Joaquin County
(Gaines 1974). In 1977, the Service reviewed the literature, examined museum material, and contacted numerous National
Audubon Society chapters and knowledgeable field observers for information on the status of the least Bell's vireo
(Wilbur 1980). Since then, several intensive surveys of virtually all potential breeding habitat in California
have been conducted (Gaines 1977, Goldwasser 1978, Goldwasser 

et al. 

1980, RECON 1989, unpublished data on file with the Fish and Wildlife Service). Least Bell's vireos remain at only
about 40 of over 150 historically occupied sites (some localities cover many miles of a water course) surveyed in the
United States from 1977 through 1991. Most of these locations contain fewer than five pairs of vireos. About 76 percent
of the U.S. population is found at just five localities. The current breeding population of the least Bell's vireo
in California consists of approximately 500 pairs. Fewer than several hundred pairs are estimated to occur in Mexico.




Consideration of New Information 



The final rule is based on new biological and economic data, and material received during the comment period for the
proposed rule and revised proposed rule. 



Total Acres Included in Critical Habitat 



The Service is designating critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo at 10 areas encompassing approximately 38,000
acres (15,200 ha) in Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego Counties, California.
About 49 percent of the vireo population in the United States occurs within these 10 areas. Critical habitat for the
vireo occurs on the Santa Ynez River (Santa Barbara County), Santa Clara River (Ventura and Los Angeles Counties),
Santa Ana River (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties), and Santa Margarita River, San Luis Rey River, Sweetwater
River, San Diego River, Tijuana River, Coyote Creek, and Jamul-Dulzura Creeks (San Diego County). 

Federal land within the critical habitat consists of approximately 10,979 acres (4,392 ha) including approximately
7,600 acres (3,040 ha) in Santa Barbara County under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, 3,338 acres (1,335 ha)
in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties under the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers, and 53 acres (21 ha) in San
Diego County under the jurisdiction of the International Boundary and Water Commission. The remainder of the critical
habitat is in State, county, city, Indian Tribe, or private ownership.

Differences From Proposed Rule and Revised Proposed Rule and Final Rule 



The May 3, 1985, proposed rule identified approximately 43,000 acres for designation as critical habitat. In preparing
the revised proposed rule, it was discovered that the 43,000-acre critical habitat figure was in error and should
have been reported as approximately 45,805 acres. Therefore, this final rule and associated documents refer to the
45,805-acre figure as the correct acreage figure from the May 3, 1985, proposed designation. 

The area encompassed by the 10 critical habitat areas has been adjusted from approximately 45,805 acres (18,322 ha)
in the original proposed rule to 48,025 acres (19,210 ha) in the revised proposed rule to about 38,000 acres (15,200
ha) in the final rule. In adjusting the boundaries, 1,400 acres (560 ha) were deleted from critical habitat on the Santa
Ynez River and 3,620 acres (1,448 ha) were added, resulting in a net increase of 2,220 acres (888 ha). This adjustment
was recommended by the Forest Service and was based on the results of additional field research on the status, distribution,
and behavior of the least Bell's vireo on the Santa Ynez River during the 1986 breeding season. An additional 120 acres
(48 ha), adjacent to the northern border of Gibraltar Reservoir, were also recommended for deletion by the Forest
Service but the Service does not believe that this change is warranted because this area contains potential nesting
habitat. All the land suggested for either withdrawal or addition to the Santa Ynez River critical habitat is under
the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. The additional 3,620 acres (1,448 ha) that were added are under Federal jurisdiction,
withdrawn from mineral entry, and without any private or commercial interests. 

Two adjustments have been made in the Santa Margarita River critical habitat area. About 420 acres (168 ha) of upland
private property were removed based on a refinement in the legal description. This adjustment did not exclude any
vireo habitat. About 9,600 acres (3,840 ha) on Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base were removed based on the finding that
an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Service and the Marine Corps for vireo management is providing
an adequate level of protection to the vireo and its habitat. Although this area is essential to the conservation of
the species, the Service finds that a formal critical habitat designation is unnecessary because the MOU contains
provisions for section 7 consultation for proposed actions that may destroy or adversely modify vireo habitat. The
Service also finds that a level of protection equivalent to or greater than that provided by a critical habitat designation
can be achieved for the vireo on this portion of the Santa Margarita River through cooperation with the Marine Corps
under the MOU. The management actions implemented under this agreement have significantly benefitted the vireo
population at this locality. It has increased from 98 territorial males in 1986 when the MOU was established to 212
territorial males in 1991. However, the Service will reconsider its position to designate critical habitat on the
Camp Pendleton reach of the Santa Margarita River if conditions warrant. The Service will use its authority under
sections 7 and 9 of the Act to insure compliance with the prohibitions on unauthorized take. 

One adjustment has been made in the San Luis Rey River critical habitat area: About 80 acres (32 ha) of upland private
property were removed based on a refinement in the legal description. This adjustment did not exclude any vireo habitat.

Available Conservation Measures 



Section 7 Consultation 



Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief
description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may
be affected by such designation. Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of
critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for
both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat
to be critical. 

Once critical habitat is designated, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies,
and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies insure that their actions
are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal
agency must consult with the Service if it determines an action may affect a listed species or its designated critical
habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse modification of critical habitat is an incremental section 7
consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate jeopardy and incidental take. Regulations implementing
this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. 



Basis for Analysis 




The evaluation of actions that may adversely modify least Bell's vireo critical habitat should consider a number
of factors such as the present condition of the habitat, the number of current pairs, the reproductive success of breeding
pairs, the expected time to regenerate sufficient habitat to support an effective population at a particular site,
and local and regional problems. Although the Service considered the entire range of the least Bell's vireo in determining
an approach to critical habitat designation, its section 7 analysis of actions that may adversely affect vireo critical
habitat will consider the significance of impacts at individual critical habitat areas as well as the entire range.
All proposed actions should be viewed as to their impacts on all four constituent elements relative to the potential
for adverse modification on individual critical habitat areas. 



Examples of Actions Affecting Critical Habitat 



Activities that disturb or remove the primary constituent elements within proposed critical habitat areas may constitute
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. In the case of the vireo, these activities include: (1)
Removal or destruction of riparian vegetation, (2) thinning of riparian growth, particularly near ground level,
(3) removal or destruction of adjacent chaparral or other upland habitats used for foraging, and (4) increases in
human-associated or human-induced disturbance. Specific actions that could adversely affect vireo critical habitat
include stream channelization, water impoundment or extraction, water diversion, livestock grazing, intensive
recreation, and conversion of presently existing riparian or adjacent upland areas to residential, agricultural,
or commercial use. Complete or major destruction of riparian vegetation would result in the extirpation of the least
Bell's vireo from the affected area, which could further endanger the species throughout the remainder of its range
and preclude opportunities for recovery. Thinning or selectively removing components of riparian vegetation could
cause vireos to abandon an area because suitable nesting and foraging sites are scarce or absent or could result in
lowered reproductive success because of diminished habitat quality. Increases in recreation could cause actual
destruction of nests or could disrupt nesting activities which in turn could cause nest abandonment, lowered hatching
success, increased rates of cowbird parasitism and depredation events, and a decrease in the number of fledged young.




Other Conservation Measures: Non-Federal Lands 



Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and unintentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners
regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat (see 16 U.S.C. 1538(a)(1), 1532(1a) and 50 CFR
17.3). Section 10(a)(1)(B) authorizes the Service to issue permits for the taking of listed species incidental to
otherwise lawful activities such as agriculture, sand and gravel mining, and urban development. Incidental take
permits must be supported by a habitat conservation plan (HCP) that identifies conservation measures that the permittee
agrees to implement to conserve the species, usually on the permittee's lands. A key element of the Service's review
of an HCP is a determination of the plan's effect upon the long-term conservation of the species. The Service would
approve an HCP, and issue a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit if the plan would minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking
and would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of that species in the wild. 

The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) is coordinating the development of HCPs for the San Diego River
and Sweetwater River critical habitat areas. This effort also included the development of draft plans for the Santa
Ana River and San Luis Rey River critical habitat areas, but these plans are no longer under consideration. The intent
of these plans is to address land use conflicts and to conserve the vireo and its habitat. The Service will issue section
10(a)(1)(B) permits, if the HCPs are acceptable. In November 1991, the Service received two permit applications
and final draft HCPs from SANDAG for the incidental take of vireos on the San Diego and Sweetwater Rivers. SANDAG is
currently finalizing the HCPs and a draft Environmental Assessment is under preparation. Based on the review of drafts
of these plans, the Service anticipates that they will be compatible with the designation of critical habitat.

Summary of Economic Analysis 



Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data
available and to consider the economic impact and any other relevant impact of specifying any particular area as critical
habitat. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusions
outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless it is determined, based on the
best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat would
result in the extinction of the species concerned. The Act thus requires the Service to evaluate those economic and
other effects likely to take place due to the designation of critical habitat, and to consider whether to exclude some
critical habitat. 

The economic effects of designating critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo are the project-related costs of
habitat mitigation within the 10 areas designated as critical habitat over and above those costs incurred as a result
of listing the vireo as an endangered species in May 1986 and as a result of compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act
for those activities involving the placement of fill into waters of the United States. 



Affected Agencies 



The Service assumes in the economic analysis that the impacts to Federal agencies are related to activities that physically
alter critical habitat. The Forest Service, Corps of Engineers (Corps), Federal Highway Administration, and International
Boundary and Water Commission are the agencies most likely to be affected by the critical habitat designation. 



Economic Effects 



Activities that may be affected include construction and maintenance of dams, water control and transport, fire
suppression, recreation, oil and gas production and transport, sand-mining, residential and commercial development
and related facilities, agriculture, and highway and bridge construction. 

Private lands within critical habitat (15,961 acres) are currently used primarily for agricultural purposes and
are not expected to be economically affected. There are no known proposals with Federal involvement. 

Numerous Federal, State, and local agencies have jurisdiction over the affected activities. Several informed the
Service that critical habitat designation is consistent or compatible with their management objectives. Although
a number of agencies expressed concern that the designation of critical habitat would affect proposed or future projects
and asked to have various project areas removed, the economic costs attributable to critical habitat for those projects
are expected to be insignificant. 

Federal agencies expected to incur economic costs attributable to designation of critical habitat include the Forest
Service, Corps of Engineers, and the International Boundary and Water Commission. The Forest Service anticipates
an increased cost of $2,000 per year for additional fire suppression activities and $1,000 per year for additional
ranger patrols to protect vireo habitat in the Santa Ynez River critical habitat area. It may become necessary for
the Corps of Engineers to initiate patrols of its land in the Santa Ana River critical habitat area to control trespassing,
at an anticipated cost of $20,000 a year. The Service believes that the International Boundary and Water Commission
flood control activities in the Tijuana River area will incur no significant economic costs. 

Construction of the Hamner Avenue Bridge in the Santa Ana River area was completed in 1985. The project included a compensation
package for adverse effects to wildlife and wetlands that cost a total of $462,000, of which $113,400 was for cowbird
control and nest monitoring to compensate for impacts to vireo habitat. The annualized value of the critical habitat
effect is $8,000 per year. 

A number of projects may incur economic costs because critical habitat designation is expected in some cases to require
habitat mitigation or compensation that goes beyond current requirements. Under current procedures, whenever
proposed projects affect wetlands, the proposing agency is required to replace habitat values either concurrently
(up to 5 acres replaced for every 1 acre lost) or prior to their destruction (1 acre replaced for every 1 acre lost). In
most cases, the agencies have chosen to replace the habitat values concurrently in order to avoid expensive project
delays. With critical habitat designation, the Service expects in some cases to require replacement of habitat values
prior to implementation of the action. The Service anticipates that the maximum additional cost would be $75,000
per acre for replacement of vireo habitat values prior to their destruction rather than concurrently. The incremental
cost is due primarily to the need for additional landscaping and revegetation to create fully functional vireo habitat
in a 2 to 3-year period. The cost of land acquired for mitigation purposes in such cases is attributable to the provisions
of the Clean Water Act, or other laws and regulations protecting the environment. In some cases where land values are
high, the total cost per acre of habitat destroyed may be less for prior replacement than for concurrent replacement.


A proposed road crossing of the San Diego River associated with the Mission Trails Regional Park could adversely affect
critical habitat. The project is still in the planning stage and the exact amount of habitat that would be affected
is not known. The Service estimates that up to 5 acres of habitat may need to be replaced. At $75,000 per acre, an additional
cost of $375,000 would be required for prior replacement of lost vireo habitat values. The annualized equivalent
of the $375,000 one-time cost is $27,000 per year.

The Home Capital Development Group's planned Rancho San Diego project may adversely affect critical habitat in the
Sweetwater River area. The Service estimates that up to 3 acres of habitat may need to be replaced prior to project initiation
at an additional cost of $225,000. The annualized equivalent of the $225,000 one-time cost is $16,000 per year. 

The Corps of Engineers authorizes a number of activities in the Prado Basin of the Santa Ana River critical habitat
area. Future changes in some of these existing activities could affect critical habitat, and proponents may incur
additional costs as a result. However, because project proposals were not identified during the public comment period
of the proposed rule, the Service is unable to provide an estimate of any economic impact due to critical habitat considerations.


Sand and gravel mining activities that are regulated under the Clean Water Act could affect critical habitat, especially
along the San Luis Rey River. Although there are no specific project proposals, the Service anticipates that the maximum
additional cost would be $75,000 per acre of habitat destroyed. 

SANDAG is coordinating the development of HCPs under section 10 of the Endangered Species Act for the San Diego River
and Sweetwater River critical habitat areas. This effort also included the development of draft plans for the Santa
Ana River and San Luis Rey River critical habitat areas but these sites are no longer under consideration. The habitat
conservation planning process is being used to address land use conflicts and to conserve the least Bell's vireo.
The Service will issue section 10(a) permits if these plans are acceptable. Based on Service review of drafts of these
plans, it is anticipated that they will be compatible with the designation of critical habitat, and no additional
economic costs are expected. 

The total cost attributable to the designation of critical habitat for projects with supporting data is approximately
$74,000 per year. Projects expected to be affected by critical habitat designation for which adequate cost data are
not available would not add substantially to that total. Impacts on regional employment, household income, and tax
revenues are expected to be insignificant. 



Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



In the proposed rule published May 3, 1985, the revised proposed rule published on August 7, 1992, and associated notifications,
all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development
of a final rule for the vireo or its critical habitat. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies,
scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A correction to
some of the legal descriptions of the proposed critical habitat was published in the June 4, 1985, 

Federal Register

 (50 FR 23458). Newspaper notices were published by June 7, 1985, in the Blade Tribune, Enterprise, Los Angeles Times,
News Press, Riverside Press, San Bernardino Sun, San Diego Transcript, San Diego Tribune, and San Diego Union, all
of which invited general public comment. Notification of public hearings and an extension of the comment period to
August 30, 1985, was published on July 9, 1985 (50 FR 27992). Public hearings were conducted in San Diego on July 30,
1985, in Oxnard on July 31, 1985, and in Anaheim, California, on August 1, 1985.

An additional notification extending the comment period to December 2, 1985, was published on October 3, 1985 (50
FR 40424). These two additional notifications were also published in the aforementioned nine newspapers in July
and October, respectively. On May 2, 1986, the least Bell's vireo was listed as endangered, and the public comment
period on proposed critical habitat was reopened for an additional 90 days (51 FR 16483). A further extension of the
comment period to January 1, 1987, was published on July 31, 1986 (51 FR 27429). Approximately 120 interested parties
were notified regarding this extension of the comment period. 

The public comment period was again reopened for 90 days subsequent to the publication of the revised proposed rule
on August 7, 1992 (57 FR 34298). Two additional public hearings were also scheduled by the Service. A legal notice announcing
the hearings and inviting general public comment on the revised proposal was published in the San Diego Union-Tribune
on August 17, 1992. About 200 potentially affected or interested parties were notified regarding this revised proposed
action. Public hearings were held in Garden Grove, California, on October 20, 1992, and in San Diego on October 22,
1992. A total of about 30 individuals attended these hearings. 

Multiple comments whether written or oral from the same interested party are regarded as one comment. Written comments
and oral statements questioning or opposing critical habitat designation as originally proposed were grouped into
24 issues and discussed in the revised proposed rule (57 FR 34892). 

Of the 87 comments received on the revised proposal to designate critical habitat, 24 (28 percent) supported the designation,
3 (3 percent) opposed the designation, 51 (59 percent) recommended that the Service change the boundaries or delay
the designation, and 9 (10 percent) were non-committal. 

The Service has identified 25 issues associated with these 87 comments that reflect a questioning of, or opposition
to, critical habitat designation and are discussed below. 



Issue 1: 

Certain areas should be excluded from critical habitat because the habitat is already degraded, or proposed plans
will indirectly degrade the habitat. Along the Santa Clara River, for example, cowbirds are numerous within the habitat
and make it less suitable for vireos. Also, reclaimed sewage water flows through the Santa Clara River, and treatment
chemicals may affect the vireo. At expected build-out conditions, the noise generated by traffic along such areas
as Jamul Creek and the San Luis Rey River may render the habitat unsuitable for vireos. 



Service Response:

 As long as the constituent elements of critical habitat are present, the factors leading to the degradation of such
habitat are not considered in the designation process. Noise, cowbird parasitism, pollution, and other factors
contribute incremental impacts upon the vireo, but management of critical habitat areas may reduce or eliminate
these impacts. Extensive unmitigated habitat loss may preclude the ability of a listed species to recover. Critical
habitat designation should reduce the chances of this occurring with respect to the least Bell's vireo. 

The Act also specifies that certain management considerations may be necessary in critical habitat areas. Cowbirds
are common in riparian habitat throughout the range of the least Bell's vireo. The judicious trapping of cowbirds
and monitoring of vireo nests has significantly reduced the detrimental effects of cowbird parasitism on the vireo
at several localities. 



Issue 2:

 Critical habitat should be modified to more accurately reflect the location of nesting and foraging habitat. Urban
developments, agricultural lands, industrial operations, recreational facilities, highways, railroads, etc.,
are included within the boundaries of critical habitat designation. 

The Service has exceeded its authority under the Act by including in the critical habitat area, land which it knows
does not meet the Act's definition of critical habitat. The regulations state that ``critical habitat will be defined
by specific limits using reference points and lines as found on standard topographic maps of the area'' [50 CFR 424.12(c)].
The Service should choose reference points that are more precise than section lines, and less ephemeral than trees
and sandbars. 



Service Response:

 The suggestion to designate more precise boundaries may be possible in some cases. No specifics on suggested boundaries
were provided. Attempting to redefine the critical habitat by another means would unduly delay a final decision on
this matter.

<DOCNO> FR940202-0-00115 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Service is required to use existing, readily recognizable boundaries in the development of legal descriptions
for critical habitat. The Service cannot use ephemeral features such as vegetation for boundaries. In cases where
areas designated as critical habitat do not contain the primary constituent elements, impacts occurring within
this area will not result in a finding of adverse modification by the Service. Thus, designation of critical habitat
will not effect those areas within the legal critical habitat boundaries that do not contain vireo nesting or foraging
habitat. 


Issue 3: 

The Service has not clarified the potential effects of critical habitat designation on private landowners. For example,
Service responses to Issues 7 and 18 in the revised proposed rule (50 FR 34892) appear contradictory. The response
to Issue 7 states that most activities potentially taking place within critical habitat will require Federal approval,
and therefore be subject to the requirements of section 7 consultation. The discussion of Issue 18, however, implies
that Federal involvement in projects on private land would be unusual. 
Federal case law indicates that designation of critical habitat will, contrary to the Service's representations,
affect activities on State and private property even if there is no Federal involvement. For example, in 

Palila 

v. 

Hawaii, 

639 F. 2d 495 (9th Cir. 1981), the court held that the state of Hawaii's maintenance of sheep and goats within Palila
(

Loxioides bailleui

) critical habitat constituted a take, even though there was no Federal involvement. 


Service Response: 

Section 7 of the Act applies only to Federal agencies, directing them to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify critical habitat. The Service maintains that a project
potentially affecting a federally listed species will only require section 7 consultation when Federal funding,
approval, permitting, licensing, or other discretionary authority is involved. Because the least Bell's vireo
critical habitat is primarily wetland, it is anticipated that the Army Corps of Engineers will be involved in projects
affecting this habitat, through the section 404 permitting process of the Clean Water Act. A section 404 permit is
required for projects involving dredge or fill of jurisdictional wetlands or waters of the United States. For projects
on private property, where wetland within critical habitat is neither dredged nor filled, Federal involvement under
section 7 is not anticipated. 
By contrast, section 9, which prohibits the unpermitted ``take'' of endangered species, applies to all ``persons''
(as defined in the Act) within the jurisdiction of the United States. Pursuant to section 9 of the Act and the regulations
and statutes pertaining thereto, ``take'' means to ``harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture
or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct'' [16 U.S.C. 1532(19)]. In the case of 

Palila 

v. 

Hawaii, 

the Court rendered an opinion on the legal definition of ``take.'' The Court ruled in 

Palila 

v. 

Hawaii 

that habitat destruction harms a species by indirectly causing a decline in the population, and precluding recovery
of the species. Therefore, the court's ruling in this case pertained to the legal definition of ``take'' and not the
designation or function of critical habitat. A landowner destroying vireo habitat might be involved in a section
9 taking, but would have no incremental legal exposure as a result of critical habitat designation.

Issue 4: 

The revised proposed rule uses an improper incremental approach to the economic analysis required by the Act. In the
revised proposed rule, the Service stated that the economic analysis should only apply to project-related costs
of mitigation within critical habitat designation over and above those costs that would be incurred as a result of
listing the vireo. The Service thereby eliminated the restraints imposed through the balancing process set forth
in section 4 of the Act. 


Service Response: 

The effects of critical habitat designation are incremental, and represent only a portion of the total cost of a species'
conservation. A high level of protection is already afforded to least Bell's vireo habitat by the Clean Water Act and
Federal wetlands policy. An additional layer of protection has been added to this by the listing of the vireo, which
prohibits jeopardy and take of the species. Even without designation of critical habitat, modification of occupied
vireo habitat can constitute jeopardy or take. Federal agencies cannot adversely modify designated critical habitat.
As discussed above under ``Available Conservation Measures,'' that is in addition to the requirement to avoid jeopardizing
the continued existence of a federally listed species. Furthermore, if a Federal agency may affect critical habitat,
that agency must consult with the Service even if the habitat happens to be unoccupied. These added section 7 requirements
were considered in the development of the economic analysis. 
In the 1982 amendments to section 4 of the Act, Congress added the word ``solely'' to the statutory directive that the
Secretary base listing on the best scientific and commercial data available. A House of Representatives report states:




The addition of the word ``solely'' is intended to remove from the process of the listing or delisting of species any
factor not related to the biological status of the species. The committee strongly believes that economic considerations
have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species * * *. Applying economic criteria
to the analysis of these alternatives and to any phase of the species listing process is applying economics to the determinations
made under section 4 of the Act and is specifically rejected by the inclusion of the word ``solely'' in this legislation.
[H.R. Rep. No. 97-304; see 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(1)(A)]



The Joint Regulations on Endangered Species also state that the Secretary may make a determination of listing ``solely
on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial information regarding a species' status, without reference
to possible economic or other impacts to such determination'' (50 CFR  424.11(b)). In 1978, Congress amended
section 4 of the Act to require the Secretary to take into consideration ``the economic impact, and any other relevant
impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat'' (16 U.S.C. 1532(5)(A)(i)). Federal regulations
on implementation of the Act state that ``A final designation of critical habitat shall be made on the basis of the best
scientific information available, after taking into consideration the probable economic and other impacts of making
such a designation in accordance with  424.19'' (50 CFR  424.12(a)). The Service interprets the history
of the Act and Federal regulations to clearly indicate that the economic analysis should only take into account the
effects of designating critical habitat, and not those of listing the species. 


Issue 5: 

Some individuals wanted to know if critical habitat designation would result in the need for additional mitigation
for projects with ongoing management or conservation plans designed to mitigate impacts to vireos. 


Service Response: 

For projects that have completed the section 7 consultation process to develop mitigation measures for direct and
indirect impacts to the least Bell's vireo and vireo habitat, it is highly unlikely that additional measures will
be required as a result of the critical habitat designation.

For example, two California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) projects in San Diego County and an Orange County
Water District water conservation project in the Prado Basin that involve Federal funds, permits, or authorizations
prompted formal section 7 consultations because of proposed impacts to vireos and/or vireo habitat irrespective
(and in advance) of critical habitat designation. In each case, the overall project-related impacts to the vireo
were evaluated and disclosed, and mitigation was proposed in the required environmental documentation. Mitigation
was appropriately developed in each instance that compensates, to the extent deemed reasonable and prudent, for
unavoidable direct and indirect impacts to the vireo, vireo habitat, and public fish and wildlife resources in general.
Therefore, the Service fully anticipates, in these instances, that no additional mitigation would be required,
prudent, or even possible as a result of the designation of critical habitat. In this regard, the Service cannot summarily
dismiss the Orange County Water District's (District) position that ``barring unforeseen circumstances, the mitigation
and conservation measures that have been implemented and proposed for implementation'' as a result of a current section
7 consultation will fully mitigate for impacts associated with the District's water conservation project. 


Issue 6: 

Since conversion of land to residential or commercial development would adversely affect critical habitat, property
owners would lose beneficial use of their land. Critical habitat designation within certain areas, such as the San
Luis Rey Municipal Water District, would thus constitute a regulatory taking of property. 



Service Response: 

Property owners within the critical habitat boundaries are not expected to lose beneficial use of their land as a result
of critical habitat designation itself. In evaluating proposed projects within critical habitat boundaries, under
section 7 of the Act, the Service would first determine if the specific area contained foraging or nesting habitat
for least Bell's vireos. The designation of critical habitat would only affect those areas that contained elements
of nesting or foraging habitat. Areas that lack foraging or nesting habitat would not be affected by the designation.
Furthermore, within critical habitat, only those activities with Federal involvement would be subject to section
7 consultation. Such involvement is most likely to occur when a project involves dredge or fill of waters of the United
States. In cases where section 7 consultation is required, reasonable and prudent alternatives or measures are likely
to be developed that do not preclude the development of private property. Given the pertinent data pertaining to past
section 7 consultations involving the vireo or other listed species in southern California, it is extremely unlikely
that any project would be effectively stopped or significantly modified because of the section 7 process. In fact,
a World Wildlife Fund study, using 12 years of data from the entire United States, concluded that ``The vast majority
of federal activities subject to consultation successfully proceeded to completion while accommodating the needs
of endangered and threatened species.'' Less than 1 percent of the actions that were the subject of formal consultation
during this study were ``blocked'' because of section 7 (Barry 

et al. 

1992). 

In the rare cases when the Service issues jeopardy opinions without acceptable reasonable and prudent alternatives,
the action agency may take the project to an exemption committee and ask that its projects be exempted from the requirements
of the Act. The Service anticipates that few, if any, opinions would not contain acceptable reasonable and prudent
alternatives. 



Issue 7: 

If it is found that water extraction is damaging to least Bell's vireo critical habitat, then restrictions on water
extraction would impinge on the rights of landowners and have a large economic impact on agriculture. Such restrictions
would also threaten the supply of domestic water necessary to meet the water demands for certain communities.

Service Response: 

As discussed in the response to Issue 3 above, only those projects with Federal involvement would be directly affected
by critical habitat designation. The Service does not anticipate any circumstances in which there would be Federal
involvement in water extraction processes on private property within any of the critical habitat areas. Water extraction
rights on private property could not be negated because of critical habitat designation. 


Issue 8: 

The benefits of designating certain areas such as Newhall property on the Santa Clara River do not exceed the economic
costs of such designation. Current and potential revenues from agriculture, housing development, and filming activities
on Newhall property, within proposed critical habitat, exceed $200 million, and revenues from adjacent Newhall
activities potentially impacted by the designation exceed $160 million. In addition to Newhall, other property
owners have expressed concerns over the costs of mitigation requirements that would be generated by the critical
habitat designation on their lands. 



Service Response: 

Newhall's analysis (Newhall Land and Farming Company 1992) and comments submitted by other landowners are based
on the assumption that designation of critical habitat would prohibit or substantially modify all activities within
the designated boundaries. The response to Issue 6 above indicates that the Service anticipates very few, if any,
projects to be stopped or significantly modified due to critical habitat designation itself. Any impact on these
projects would be through section 9 prohibitions on taking. 

In addition, habitat occupied by vireos is already protected because of its status as a federally-listed species.
The Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Federal wetland policy,
sections 1601 and 1603 of the California Fish and Game Code, and the California Environmental Quality Act also provide
various degrees of consideration or protection for these areas. The requirements of these statutes overlap considerably,
and ascribing costs incurred for mitigation or compensation to each of these statutes separately is problematical.


If occupied vireo habitat, jurisdictional wetlands or waters of the United States are to be affected by a Federal agency
or project proponent, that agency or project proponent is presently required (in the absence of critical habitat
designation) to replace those values with from 1 to 5 acres of appropriate habitat created for every acre lost. However,
this replacement is generally mandated at the Federal level only if the impact exceeds 1 acre under the Corps' Nationwide
Permit Program implementing, in part, section 404 of the Clean Water Act or if vireos would be affected by the project
pursuant to section 7 of the Act and the implementing regulations pertaining thereto. 

With critical habitat designation, the essential elements of suitable, but unoccupied, habitat must be preserved
through project design or mitigation. Thus, designation of critical habitat generally would have an incremental
economic effect only on federally involved projects that are less than an acre in size or that require mitigation measures
above and beyond what is currently being negotiated or required given the vireo's status as a listed species and the
regulatory authority of the Corps of Engineers and California Department of Fish and Game to require the minimization
or mitigation of impacts to jurisdictional wetlands or waters. Therefore, those mitigation measures attributable
solely to critical habitat designation (e.g., the replacement or rehabilitation of small amounts of habitat, contributions
to habitat or species management funds) are expected to be relatively infrequent and add only incrementally to project
costs. Costs associated with wetland creation are discussed under the response to Issue 3 in the revised proposed
rule (57 FR 34892).

In any case, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act state that costs associated with
mitigation or compensation are part of the project costs. Because the least Bell's vireo is essentially an obligate
wetland species, the costs associated with impacts to unoccupied vireo habitat would be borne by the project applicant
whether or not critical habitat was designated. However, the Service believes that no mitigation costs will be attributable
to the designation of critical habitat for projects on private lands that are outside the jurisdiction of Federal
regulatory agencies. 

Issue 9:

 The designation of critical habitat may impact flood control projects. If periodic removal of riparian vegetation
from flood control channels is restricted, the impacts will involve not only losses of water and uncontrolled flooding,
but also costs in terms of human life. 

Service Response:

 The response to Issue 6 above states that projects are rarely blocked, since reasonable and prudent alternatives
or measures are usually developed that allow the project to proceed in a timely manner. The response to Issue 8 above
addresses the potential increase in regulation due to critical habitat designation. A high level of protection is
afforded to wetlands by the Clean Water Act and Federal wetland policy. Regulations to avoid, minimize, or compensate
for impacts to wetlands in general, and vireo habitat in particular, would be incurred even if critical habitat was
not designated. The layer of regulation added through critical habitat designation is not expected to preempt public
health and safety. Although the Service encourages long-range planning of all projects that adversely affect the
vireo or vireo habitat, it recognizes that emergencies (e.g., fires) develop that necessitate accelerated consultations
or the assessment of impacts and development of appropriate mitigation measures after-the-fact. 




Issue 10:

 Utility corridors and access roads should not be included as critical habitat. Both routine and emergency maintenance
are necessary to maintain public safety and service. 

Service Response:

 Utility corridors exist within least Bell's vireo critical habitat; however, no biological evidence or other basis
justifies the exclusion of such corridors from a critical habitat designation. The Service will address each project
on a case-by-case basis and assist the Federal action agency in avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating for impacts
to the vireo and its critical habitat. In addition, agencies are generally encouraged to request formal consultation
on programmatic activities. Such consultations would facilitate long range planning efforts. The Service is unaware
of any instances where the maintenance of utility structures or facilities was precluded by the listing of the vireo;
it is anticipated that the designation of critical habitat similarly will not impinge on necessary operations. Furthermore,
as was explained in the response to Issue 9 above, pertinent regulations and Service policy provide for the resolution
of impacts to listed species and their critical habitat that result from corrective actions taken in true emergency
situations. 

Issue 11:

 Designation of critical habitat requires an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to the requirement for
Federal agencies to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 

Service Response:

 For the reasons cited in the NEPA section of this rule, the Service has determined that rules issued pursuant to section
4(a) of the Endangered Species Act do not require the preparation of an EIS.

Issue 12:

 Prior replacement of habitat should only be required when it can be conclusively determined that existing habitat
is being used at its full potential. Several commenters also expressed the opinion that the mandated replacement
of vireo habitat prior to project commencement would be an unreasonable and excessive requirement. 



Service Response:

 In the vast majority of section 7 consultations on potential impacts to the vireo, the Service has recommmended prior
replacement of vireo habitat, and does not anticipate changing this pattern with designation of critical habitat.
Only in cases involving a relatively large acreage of unoccupied vireo habitat would such a requirement result from
critical habitat designation. Because requirements for habitat replacement in advance have invariably been prompted
by projects with substantial impacts to vireos or significant portions of occupied vireo habitat, it is anticipated
that prior habitat replacement would be necessary in those circumstances regardless of whether critical habitat
has been designated. In some cases, especially where land costs are high, project proponents have chosen to mitigate
project-related impacts in advance to increase the likelihood of ``no net loss'' of wetland or vireo habitat values.
This approach has also been used as a means to minimize the required amount of habitat compensation. 



Issue 13:

 Several commenters suggested that the Service should specify the criteria used to distinguish vireo quality habitat
within the designated boundaries. Some suggested that the Service should have designated boundaries to more accurately
reflect the actual habitat boundaries. 



Service Response:

 In establishing the approximate limits of actual critical habitat within the designated critical habitat area boundaries,
the Service utilized National Wetland Inventory maps. Because the large majority of vireo habitat consists of mixed
woodland or willow woodland habitats that are contained within jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the United
States, these maps fairly accurately designate the extent of actual or potential habitat at a designated locale.




Issue 14:

 The Service has not addressed the biological implications of artificially sustaining riparian habitat in the successional
stage appropriate to support least Bell's vireos. What associated habitats and species will suffer from receiving
a lower level of protection as a direct or indirect effect of the designation? 



Service Response:

 The Service is not advocating artificial maintenance of riparian habitat at a particular successional stage. Rather,
the Service is advocating maintenance of natural systems under conditions that will be conducive to supporting vireo
populations. Since the vireo was first listed by the state of California in 1980, it has not been necessary to artificially
maintain vireo habitat at a given successional stage. 



Issue 15:

 Designation of critical habitat should be postponed until ongoing conservation plans to mitigate negative impacts
to the vireo are in place and evaluated, or until further studies are completed and we know exactly why the vireo has
declined. 



Service Response:

 On the basis of past experience with other listed species and critical habitat designations, the Service believes
that the designation of critical habitat will not be incompatible with existing conservation or management plans.
Current drafts of habitat conservation plans for the San Diego and Sweetwater Rivers are considered by the Service
to be compatible with critical habitat designation. The designation of critical habitat may, in fact, simplify the
creation and funding of area or drainage-specific management plans. 

Based on the demonstrated, relative success of several vireo management plans and other conservation efforts within
its range and the endangered status of this species, the Service cannot justify the postponement of critical habitat
designation until all management plans are evaluated or in place. Such a postponement could reduce the chances for
the survival or recovery of the species. 



Issue 16:

 The Orange County Water District requested the exclusion of all lands below the 505-foot elevation in the Prado Basin
from critical habitat designation because of its commitment to mitigate impacts to vireos and vireo habitat below
that elevational contour. 



Service Response:

 The Corps' Draft EIS for the Orange County Water District's water conservation project indicates that implementation
of the District's project will be phased. The level of the water conservation pool will be incrementally raised: (1)
Once habitat above the 505-foot elevation is rehabilitated, restored, or created to replace occupied and presently
unoccupied vireo habitat below 505-ft that is destroyed or degraded because of the project, and (2) it is demonstrated
that the vireo population is not adversely impacted by their displacement or the destruction or degradation of preferred
habitat. For these reasons, the Service did not remove lands from critical habitat designation within the Prado Basin
that currently accommodate a majority of the nesting pairs representing the second largest vireo population in the
United States. 



Issue 17:

 Several commenters noted that the Service should also list critical habitat for other areas (e.g., the lower Santa
Ynez River in Santa Barbara County) or for all areas with populations of more than 10 pairs of vireos. 



Service Response:

 The Service retains the option to consider the designation of additional critical habitat. Designation of more critical
habitat would be the subject of a new proposed rule that would solicit public comments and provide for a public hearing,
if so requested.

Issue 18: 

Given the high levels of cowbird nest parasitism and habitat loss, it may already be too late to save the vireo even if
habitat is preserved. 



Service Response: 

The stability or instability of populations is not one of the criteria used to determine the appropriateness of designating
critical habitat. The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat for a listed species in areas that are
essential to the conservation of the species, unless it is not prudent to do so. The Act would require the designation
of critical habitat even if little could be done to minimize most threats facing the species. Fortunately, however,
the vireo has responded favorably to management in a number of locations throughout its range. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to conclude that the designation of critical habitat will provide additional protection to the vireo
and increase the likelihood of its recovery. 



Issue 19: 

Certain areas should not be designated as critical habitat because they do not ``* * * require special
management considerations or protections,'' as prescribed by section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act. This comment was
usually followed by a belief about which type of regulations already provide ``special management considerations
or protections.'' 

The Service should not designate critical habitat because other regulations and levels of government already protect
the habitat sufficiently. For example, local and/or State governments can manage habitat and prevent private landowners
from clearing riparian vegetation. Projects altering a stream course are subject to review under section 1601 or
1603 of the California Fish and Game Code. 

Federal regulations also protect proposed critical habitat. Designation of critical habitat is not necessary for
areas in which activities are planned that will require National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and compliance.
Nor is it necessary to designate critical habitat on the Santa Ynez River because this area is already protected under
the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. All these regulations and management practices preclude the need for designating
critical habitat. 



Service Response: 

Local governments have not prevented habitat loss for the least Bell's vireo under existing regulatory mechanisms.
Areas under Federal jurisdiction may require special management considerations or protection that would not be
afforded without critical habitat designation. For these reasons, the Service believes that inclusion of areas
already subject to local, State, or Federal regulations is consistent with the definition of critical habitat cited
under section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act. 



Issue 20: 

Critical habitat designation in the Prado Basin of the Santa Ana River would force the Corps of Engineers to release
storm water quickly (to minimize the adverse effects of standing water on vireo habitat) and at too great a velocity
for the local water district to divert it into their percolation (spreading) basins for water conservation. 



Service Response: 

The Service has been working with the Corps of Engineers, Orange County Water District, and The Nature Conservancy
to resolve conflicts between vireo conservation and flood control/water conservation activities in the Prado Basin.
Based on the distribution and abundance of the vireo within the Prado Basin relative to the reservoir pool inundation
zone, these water management activities may affect a listed species. On that basis, the Corps initiated formal consultation
with the Service on October 16, 1992. The Corps has included a thorough compensation package as part of the project
description. The proposed compensation measures very likely adequately provide for impacts to the vireo and its
habitat. For this reason, the Service believes that a critical habitat designation is not likely to impose any additional
costs for avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating impacts to the vireo. 



Issue 21: 

The cost of mitigation as a result of critical habitat designation would place an unreasonable financial risk on the
project proponent. For example, one commenter estimated it would cost about $4-10 million to create habitat
to compensate for the habitat that would be destroyed by raising the height of Gibraltar Dam. Since riparian habitat
creation is expensive and the results are unpredictable, the project proponents may spend a great deal of money with
no return if the mitigation program should fail. 



Service Response: 

As stated in the response to Issue 12 above, designation of critical habitat could, in a few cases, require prior habitat
replacement of applicants for projects in areas that contain suitable, but unoccupied, vireo habitat.

Wetland compensatory mitigation can be a costly, time-consuming, and difficult endeavor with an uncertain probability
of success. However, in the 6 years since the vireo was listed, two agencies have constructed projects that have been
subject to this prior replacement requirement, and both have successfully created habitat that now supports vireos.
As restoration techniques are further refined, it is likely that revegetation projects will become more successful
in shorter time frames. The requirement to create vireo habitat before existing habitat is destroyed ensures that
this federally listed species would not sustain a loss of habitat, even temporarily. In some cases, the temporary
loss of habitat may have a significant adverse impact on the vireo. Given the uncertainty of wetland creation or restoration,
it is unlikely that the Service would support a project proposal that would result in the destruction of large areas
of riparian habitat without first providing adequate replacement habitat for the least Bell's vireos in the area.


Under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, the Secretary has the authority to exclude an area from critical habitat designation
``* * * if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such
area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial data available,
that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.''
The Gibraltar Reservoir population of the vireo represents the northern edge of its current range, and therefore
is most likely to be the source of recolonization to the north or to the Central Valley. Because of this geographical
significance, the designation of this area as critical habitat is appropriate. 

In any case, the proposed project to raise the height of Gibraltar Dam is not currently being considered, since the
city of Santa Barbara is using economically feasible alternative water sources. 



Issue 22: 

Critical habitat should not be designated because of project delays due to lengthy permitting processes and the time
required to offset negative impacts before a project could be constructed. 



Service Response: 

For projects where unavoidable impacts to unoccupied vireo habitat would occur, compensatory mitigation in the
form of habitat creation may have to be completed prior to the destruction of existing habitat so that the vireo would
not sustain a net loss of available nesting or foraging habitat. 

The amount of time for successful habitat creation would vary depending on the methods used and could take several
years. The action agency or permit applicant would need to initiate the restoration activities early enough to allow
sufficient time for vireo habitat to develop. Most major projects are in the planning stages long enough to provide
adequate time for advance habitat creation if the compensation efforts are done expeditiously. Proper planning
would reduce the likelihood of a project delay. 

Section 7 regulations require the Service to complete formal consultation within 90 days of initiation and issue
a biological opinion within an additional 45 days. By policy and in practice, the Service usually completes formal
consultation within 90 days. 



Issue 23: 

Designation of critical habitat is unnecessary because nest parasitism by cowbirds and predation are responsible
for the decline of the vireo, rather than habitat loss. One commenter stated that vireo habitat is plentiful, and efforts
to conserve the species should focus on other aspects of its ecology. 



Service Response: 

Two major factors have been identified as being responsible for the relatively recent, dramatic decline of the least
Bell's vireo: (1) Widespread habitat destruction, and (2) high rates of nest parasitism by cowbirds (Goldwasser


et al.

 1980). The synergistic effects of these two factors may have further exacerbated the situation. Although cowbird
removal programs have effectively solved the problem of excessive parasitism at a number of locales, habitat conservation
and creation programs have not achieved the same level of success. These programs eventually must be successful if
conservation and recovery of the vireo is to be achieved. To that end, the designation of critical habitat affords
a higher level of protection to riparian woodland habitats that currently (or potentially could) support nesting
pairs of vireos. The Service considers this action particularly appropriate in light of the inability of existing
regulatory mechanisms (e.g., the Clean Water Act, local regulations) to adequately protect vireo habitat.

Issue 24:

 The critical habitat designation would result in more stringent local permitting and approval processes. 



Service Response:

 The Service has no authority to require local agencies to implement land use restrictions consistent with the regulations
protecting designated critical habitat although the Service would support such actions. The commenters who raised
this issue are land owners in San Diego County. The Service contacted the San Diego County Department of Planning and
Land Use (DPLU) with respect to this issue and was informed that the DPLU does not anticipate any changes in local ordinances
as a result of critical habitat designation (T. Oberbauer, County of San Diego, Department of Planning and Land Use,
pers. comm.). 



Issue 25:

 The Service should not designate critical habitat on Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base because the Service and the
Marine Corps have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that was designed to accomplish the same degree of habitat
protection as critical habitat would provide. The management program for the least Bell's vireo on Camp Pendleton
eliminates the need for special management considerations, and therefore, designation of critical habitat is unnecessary.




Service Response:

 The Service believes that the MOU is providing an adequate level of protection to the vireo and its habitat on Camp Pendleton.
Under the MOU, the Service agreed to offer technical assistance and to consult under section 7 of the Act when requested.
The Marine Corps agreed to consult under section 7 of the Act on activities that may affect the least Bell's vireo, to
request formal consultation on various programmatic issues such as road maintenance and fire control, to maintain
1,200 acres (480 ha) of vireo quality habitat along the Santa Margarita River, and to continue cowbird trapping efforts
(which were initiated in 1983) and nest monitoring activities (which were initiated in 1981) as long as funding was
available. 

The Santa Margarita River supported 1,200 acres of quality vireo habitat and 98 territorial male least Bells' vireos
when the MOU was signed in 1986. Since 1986, the Marine Corps has continued cowbird trapping efforts, and until 1991
carried out a thorough monitoring program. The vireo population along the Santa Margarita River on Camp Pendleton
has increased from 98 to 212 territorial males from 1986 to 1991. 

Although this area is essential to the conservation of the species, the Service finds that a formal critical habitat
designation is unnecessary because the MOU contains provisions for section 7 consultation for proposed actions
that may destroy or adversely modify vireo habitat. The Service also finds that a level of protection equivalent to
or greater than that provided by a critical habitat designation can be achieved for the vireo on this portion of the
Santa Margarita River through cooperation with the Marine Corps under the MOU. However, the Service will reconsider
its position to designate critical habitat at this locality if conditions warrant. The Service will use its authority
under sections 7 and 9 of the Act to insure compliance with the prohibitions on unauthorized take. For these reasons,
the Service has removed about 9,600 acres (3,840 ha) on Camp Pendleton from the critical habitat designation.
