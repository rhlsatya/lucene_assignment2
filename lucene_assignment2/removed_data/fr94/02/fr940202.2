ACTION: 

Notice; adoption of final policy.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service is adopting final policy and procedure related to timber sale contract financial security. The
final policy will increase the amount of the bid guarantee, revise the method for determining damages for failure
to consummate a contract, eliminate the performance bond ceiling, and limit the applicability of the sale discounting
procedures. The intent of the final policy is to better protect the public's interest in the sale of National Forest
System timber by reducing the opportunity for speculative bidding and defaulting contract obligations. This policy
is being issued to guide Forest Service personnel as Amendment No. 2400-93-

XX

 to the Forest Service Manual (FSM) chapter 2430, Amendment No. 2400-93-

XX

 to FSM chapter 2450 and Amendment No. 2409.18-93-

XX

 to chapter 50 of FSH 2409.18, the Timber Sale Preparation Handbook.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




After the timber market collapse of 1981, an unprecedent number of National Forest System timber sale contracts became
unprofitable. Some contracts were defaulted and others were ``bought out'' by the Government under the Federal Timber
Contract Payment Modification Act. The market decline during the 1980 period exposed a number of potential long-term
difficulties with National Forest System timber sale procedures which, if not remedied, could result in speculative
bidding and increase the potential for contract defaults in the future.

In 1982, the Forest Service began implementing a number of contract reforms to reduce speculative and unsound bidding,
to provide for an even flow of timber receipts into the Treasury, and to prevent sale defaults. The following changes
or additions to financial requirements on National Forest System sales were made:


(1) The timber sale bid guarantee was raised to 5 percent of the advertised value of contract;



(2) A cash deposit was required. The initial deposit requirement was for 5 percent of the bid value of a sale; this was
later increased to 10 percent;



(3) The maximum amount of the performance bond was changed from $200,000 to $500,000; and

(4) A midpoint payment to the Government was required to provide additional incentive for timely timber removal.

These changes in timber sale financial requirements have been somewhat successful in stabilizing timber sale contracting
by encouraging performance; discouraging speculation; and more adequately securing contract performance. However,
additional changes are needed to further enhance financial security of timber sale contracts and to protect the taxpayer
from repudiation of bids and default of contracts.

Past experience indicates that prices being bid for Forest Service timber frequently rise substantially over the
advertised rates established by the agency's appraisal of the fair market value of the timber. The agency determines
the appraised value by using the selling value of lumber and other forest products or by using transaction evidence
of other comparable timber sales. When bid values far exceed advertised values and lumber selling values remain constant
or rise minimally, the potential for purchase financial loss increases. Thus, based on bidding experience, the Forest
Service believes that the public and the Government could be facing additional repudiations of bids and defaults
of contracts if lumber selling values do not keep pace with bid values and if additional financial security requirements
are not instituted. Accordingly, the agency believes it is essential to take additional steps to protect the public's
financial interests in timber sale contracts, assure timely execution and completion of contracts, and minimize
the financial risk to the Government. These additional financial security measure were published as a proposed policy
in the 

Federal Register

 of December 7, 1990 (55 FR 50651).




Analysis and Response to Public Comments



The comment period on the proposed policy closed January 7, 1991. Nineteen respondents submitted comments. The comments
came from 2 private citizens, 10 timber purchasers, 5 timber purchase associations, a preservation association,
and timber advocacy group. Of the 19 public comments received, 15 came from the West and 4 from the East. Fifty-eight
percent of the respondents expressed support for the policy proposals either in their entirety or with suggested
modification. The remaining 42 percent did not support the proposal primarily because of perceived increases in
the cost of doing business.

The following summarizes the comments and suggestions received on the proposed policy changes and the Department's
response to these in the final policy.



1. Performance Guarantee Ceiling



The proposed policy would have eliminated the present $500,000 ceiling on the amount of performance guarantee required
by the timber sale contract and set the minimum performance guarantee at 10 percent of the bid value.

One respondent suggested that, at the time of first entry into a sale area, the performance bond be equal to the present
value of the ``worse case'' outcome of the logging operation. The agency disagrees. The objective of a performance
guarantee or performance bond is to assure that the terms of the contract are met. Performance guarantees must protect
the interests of the Government. The respondent's suggestion would be impossible to administer. The Agency believes
that determining the ``worst case'' outcome would be highly subjective and subject to dispute between the contract
parties. The ``worst case'' outcome might be the default of a high priced sale which was later resold to determine damages.
Making a projection of some future resale value of a sale that may or may not be defaulted is speculative and could result
in very high performance bonds which would place an unfair economic burden on the majority of the timber purchasers
who fully perform their timber sale contracts.

Four respondents objected to eliminating the performance bond ceiling. They thought the change would result in increases
in their bonding requirements, put them at a competitive disadvantage, and discriminate against small business.
The agency recognizes that small business could be disadvantaged in obtaining bonding in excess of $500,000. Nevertheless,
the agency believes that only a few large and high value timber sales will require bonds of more than $500,000. The agency
is of the opinion that 10 percent of the bid value is a reasonable amount for providing the minimum amount of performance
bond to provide assurance of contract performance.

Most of the timber sale contracts sold within the last 15 years have required a performance guarantee that was equivalent
to 10 percent of the bid value subject to certain maximum amounts. The maximum performance guarantee for sales sold
since the spring of 1982 has been $500,000. Removal of the $500,000 ceiling would ensure that the performance guarantee
amount would be applied equally to all sales. In the face of existing bids, the current ceiling could result in less
secure guarantees that purchasers of high-priced sales will perform their contracts. Removal of the ceiling on performance
guarantees should not affect many of those purchasers that ordinarily bid on National Forest timber sales. The removal
of the cap would only affect sales with more than $5 million bid value. Very few sales are this size, and few small businesses
buy timber sales that are this expensive. Therefore, the change would not stifle or constrain competition. What the
removal of the ceiling will do is help to deter speculation by increasing capital requirements and, thus, in these
large sales increase bidder financial liability in the event of default.

Having considered the comments received, the agency is retaining the elimination of the $500,000 upper limit on performance
bonds in the final policy.



2. Increased Bid Guarantee



Under the proposed policy, the amount of bid guarantee required for bidding on National Forest System timber sales
would increase to 10 percent of the advertised value.

One respondent suggested that the purchaser be required to pay the full amount of the winning bid at the time of the sale.
The agency believes this would place a severe economic hardship on timber purchasers that would result in a significant
decrease in competition and a reduction in receipts to Federal, State, and county treasuries. In some cases, requiring
full payment of bid value at time of sale could prevent companies from purchasing National Forest System timber resulting
in loss of employment and economic hardship to dependent communities.

Five respondents were opposed to increasing the amount of bid guarantee to 10 percent of the advertised value. The
basis for their objection was that the additional bid guarantee would place an additional economic stress on the small
timber purchaser and would eliminate many from bidding. The agency disagrees. The bid guarantee (deposit with bid)
is a good faith showing that a timber sale high bidder will complete the requirements for contract award and will execute
the contract within the specified time period. The bid guarantee also serves as a measure of the ability of the bidder
to meet the financial requirements for a downpayment, periodic payment, and bonding capacity. Many bidders use bid
bonds as a bid guarantee rather than obligating their cash. If bid bonds are used, only the high bidder would be required
to convert the bid bond to cash, and it is not necessarily an increase in cash requirements for all bidders. The high
bidder's cash would then be used to offset the amount required for downpayment. The increase in bid guarantee from
5 percent to 10 percent of advertised value will result in the high bidder making a larger cash deposit for the approximately
30 days between the bid date and the due date for the downpayment. This short-term increased cash requirement could
create a financial hardship for some high bidders. The agency believes that this hardship is more than offset by the
increased protection from speculative bidding and from contract repudiation. The increase in bid guarantee will
also provide the government with increased financial security by providing a source of funds to satisfy the Government's
losses if the contract is repudiated. Therefore, an increase in bid guarantee to 10 percent of the advertised value
is adopted in the final policy.


3. Procedures for Determining Contract Repudiation Damages


The proposed policy based the determination of damages resulting from repudiation of a bid on the terms contained
in timber sale contract provision C(T)9.4. Provision C(T)9.4 generally establishes damages as the difference between
current contract value at the time of breach and the bid value established upon resale. The proposed policy provided
the option of retaining the timber and establishing damages for breach based on appraised rather than resale value,
if resale could not be accomplished in the immediate future or if no bid was received at resale.
One respondent supported the concept that repudiation constitutes a breach of contract. The respondent suggested
that the penalty for this breach should not only exclude the bidder from participating in the resale, but also treat
damages as a default with the bidder being required to furnish double the normal downpayment until any default amount
is satisfied. The agency agrees with this comment. Repudiation of contracts will be handled under 36 CFR 223.49(e)
which requires that a purchaser or affiliate awarded a future Forest Service contract must meet additional downpayment
requirements under specific circumstances, including failure to perform in accordance with the terms of a timber
sale contract. The additional downpayment requirements are that such a purchaser must make a minimum downpayment
equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium.
Three respondents suggested that repudiated contracts be offered and sold to the second high bidder at the price submitted
by that bidder. They further suggested that damages be determined as the difference between the original high bid
and the second high bid. This approach would be satisfactory in many instances. The agency believes, however, that
there will be instances where second high bidders would decline to accept the sale at the price they bid because of the
lapse of time from the bid date. When this occurs there would be no resale of the timber and, consequently, no basis for
determining damages. This approach would also present the risk of selling the sale at the lower second high bid when,
during an ascending market, open competitive bidding would result in a higher bid. Consequently, the final policy
retains the features of the proposed policy, and damage calculation will be based on offering the sale to the lower
bidders in descending order of their bids at the high bid price. If no bidder accepts the sale at the high bid price, it
would normally be reoffered at advertised rates for open bidding.
One respondent stated that the proposed policy was an over reaction to the problem and suggested that the government
make an estimate of repudiation damages before advertising and then set the bid guarantee accordingly. This approach
is similar to the concept of liquidated damages that is currently the method for determining damages resulting from
repudiation of service contracts. however, the agency believes that to adequately protect the public interest,
damages must be based on an actual loss or cost to the government and that estimating the damages of a potential repudiation
well in advance of the fact would be fraught with inaccuracies and very subjective. It would be very difficult to accurately
estimate bid rates 60 or more days in advance. In summary, this approach would not provide the government with an adequate
determination of damages resulting from repudiation of a bid.
Four respondents objected to the language of the proposed policy that would provide the Forest Service the option
of retaining the timber and establishing damages for this breach based on appraisal rather than resale, if resale
cannot be accomplished in the immediate future or if no bids are received on the resale. These respondents think that
the Forest Service must resell the repudiated sale in order to establish damages. They contend that if the repudiated
sale is withdrawn for some reason, the government has not suffered damages. They would establish damages based on
the resale value plus certain additional costs, such as interest and the cost of resale. The agency disagrees with
this comment. The effort and resources expended to prepare and offer a timber sale are made in good faith. Repudiations
add delay and costs regardless of subsequent events. Delay may cause loss of the opportunity to sell the timber at all
if timber is damaged or deteriorates due to fire, insects, or storm damage. Also legal or other government actions
such as new legislation, new court interpretations of existing law, or an agency listing of a wildlife species as threatened
or endangered may develop during or as a result of delay which make prompt resale not possible. Even though most sales
are reoffered for sale within six months, the agency strongly believes that damages based on the appraised value of
the sale plus administrative costs associated with the repudiation are appropriate if the sale cannot be reoffered.
Therefore, the final policy differs from the proposed policy only in that a bidder that repudiates a timber sale contract
will be subject to double down payment for future contracts. Under the final policy, when a sale is reoffered and the
resale bid price does not exceed the original purchaser's price plus certain additional costs (e.g. interest and
the cost of resale), damages are assessed at the amount of the deficiency. Further, the policy provides the Forest
Service the option of retaining the timber and establishing damages for this breach based on appraisal rather than
resale, when resale is not accomplished in the immediate future or if no bids are received at resale.


4. Timber Sale Discounting


The proposed policy would have discontinued the discount procedure implemented on a forest-wide test basis on some
National Forests in western Oregon, western Washington, and northern California and would have applied the current
discounting procedures on an individual sale basis when timber characteristics support a need for immediate harvesting.
Instances might include fire-damaged, insect-damaged, and wind-thrown timber when prompt removal would support
the accomplishment of land management objectives and provide for optimal utilization of salvage timber.

Four respondents objected to discontinuing the discounting test. They stated that discounting provides an incentive
to counter the hoarding tendency of some purchasers and enhances the continued harvest of timber sales in a timely
manner. These respondents think that an incentive-based approach encouraging early harvest is much better than
the proposed policy which they considered a disincentive. Two respondents objected to use of discounting procedures
on an individual sale basis. Stating that the proposal was inadequately defined, was an administrative over-reaction,
and was costly and complicated, these respondents concluded that the Forest Service will be reluctant to apply discounting
to individual sales.
The agency recognizes that incentives such as discounting are effective in encouraging early harvest of timber.
However, the agency believes that continued area-wide use of discounting as an inducement for early harvest of timber
is not warranted based on current market conditions, low volume of timber under contract, current rapid rates of harvest,
and anticipated lower sale levels. The agency believes that blanket use of discounting unnecessarily devalues the
timber when there is no need for prompt harvest of timber. Further, the agency believes the continued use of discounting
could contribute to speculative bidding by persons who expect to harvest timber early in the contract period. Such
speculation may result in an unfair competitive advantage for some purchasers. Also, if a purchaser's expectations
of early harvest cannot be realized, payment of undiscounted prices higher than expected could cause default.
Despite agency concerns about the blanket application of area-wide discounting, the agency believes that there
are some situations (e.g., early removal of fire-damaged, insect-damaged, and wind-thrown timber), where the use
of discounting can be warranted. In such situations, the expectation is that lower payment rates and the other disadvantages
of discounting will be more than offset by the benefits of prompt harvest of timber subject to rapid deterioration
and by protection of other resource values. Further, discounting procedures on an area-wide basis may become warranted
if the present market or other conditions is an area change to the degree that encouragement of prompt harvest is in
the government's interest. For example, high levels of uncut volume under contract could cause the agency to consider
area-wide use of discounting.
Recognizing that the discount procedures are complicated and that there could be some reluctance among Forest Service
officials to include discounting provisions in an individual timber sale contract or to seek approval for area-wide
use, the agency believes that justification and approval processes will ensure that discounting is applied only
where and when there is good rationale for its use.
Therefore, having considered all of the comments, the final policy on discounting is the same as that proposed. The
final policy provides for use of discounting upon an individual sale basis when specific situations justify the need
for immediate harvesting and on an area-wide basis only when warranted by market conditions and upon request of the
Regional Forester and approved by the Chief. Under the final policy, situations requiring the use of discounting
must be documented by the line officer with the authority to approve the sale on which it is to be used. When market conditions
warrant discounting on a National Forest or area-wide basis, the Regional Forester may request approval to use discounting
from the Chief of the Forest Service. The request for approval must document the existing and anticipated market conditions
(e.g., volume under contract, rate of removal, when volume is removed during the contract, expected sell levels)
for the Region or area affected.


Conclusion


The objectives of the financial security measures contained in this final policy are to assure timely execution and
completion of timber sale contracts, to maintain competition by qualified bidders, to discourage speculation,
and to minimize the financial risk to the Government in instances where purchasers do not complete contracts.
The final policy eliminates the present $500,000 ceiling on the amount of performance guarantee required by the timber
Sale contract, and establishes the minimum performance guarantee at 10 percent of the total bid value.
The final policy increases the amount of bid guarantee required to bid on National Forest System timber sales to 10
percent of the total advertised value.
Under the final policy, repudiation of a bid will be considered a breach of contract and damages will be based on the
bid price of the reoffered timber plus administrative costs, such as the costs incurred by the government in making
the reoffer plus interest. Further, if no bids are received on the reoffered sale or if the timber cannot be immediately
reoffered due to delay or other factors, damages will be the difference between the repudiated bid value and the appraised
value of the reoffering. Administrative costs will then be added to the difference in values.

The final policy discontinues the discounting procedure implemented on a forest-wide, test basis on some National
Forests in western Washington, Oregon and Northern California initiated in 1982 (47 FR 16181). The final policy provides
for Service-wide use of discounting upon an individual sale basis when specific situations justify the need for immediate
harvesting and on an area-wide basis only when warranted by market conditions and upon request of the Regional Forester
and approval by the Chief.


Regulatory Impact


This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulations. It has been
determined that this policy is not a major rule. The procedures implemented by this policy will not have an effect of
$100 million or more on the economy, substantially increase prices or costs for consumers, industry, State, or local
governments, nor adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability
of United States-based enterprises to compete in foreign markets. In short, little or no effect on the National economy
will result from this notice of policy change. This action consists of administrative changes to policy for timber
sale contract financial security. With regard to the removal of the bond maximum, very few sales are over $5 million
in value; therefore, few sales or purchasers are involved. The largest of sales are more likely to affect large businesses
than small. The change in liability for repudiation of contract (by failing to provide the necessary bond; execute
the contract; or make the required cash deposit) will only have an effect on purchasers who do not consummate their
contracts. These purchasers are expected to be few in number. All prospective purchasers must submit a bid guarantee
with their bids. The guarantee is returned to the unsuccessful bidders after completion of the bid opening procedures.
Only the high bidder is required to maintain the bid guarantee until the contract is consummated. Under existing procedures,
the successful purchaser would have to provide a performance bond equal to 10 percent of the bid value and, in addition,
make a minimum cash deposit equal to 10 percent of the bid value within 30 days after notification of award. In view of
existing requirements, increasing the bid guarantee to 10 percent of the advertised value should have minimal effects
on purchasers.
This final policy has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12630,
and it has been determined that the final policy does not pose the risk of a taking of constitutionally protected private
property.
Moreover, this policy has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), and it
has been determined that this policy will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities as
defined by the Act. Additional financial security measures do have some economic impact on all classes of businesses,
and the majority of the agency's timber sales are purchased by small businesses. However, the adopted measures have
the intended effect of preventing speculative bids, defaults, and repudiation of timber sales. Therefore, they
will benefit the majority of small businesses dependent on the agency's timber sales as a source of raw material, by
helping ensure that small businesses are not competing for the limited timber resource that is offered for sale against
businesses that speculatively bid or make a high bid and then lack the financial means to operate the sales. Moreover,
these measures will preserve the long-range revenues to affected counties and will reduce the adverse economic impacts
these entities would experience in the event of sale defaults.
Further, this policy has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Adoption of this policy
will have the following effect: (1) All state and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this policy or
which would impede its full implementation are preempted; (2) the policy expressly repeals or modifies previous
policies; (3) the policy is not to be applied retroactively; (4) and no administrative procedures are necessary before
a party may file suit in court challenging this policy.
This policy will not result in additional paperwork not already required by law or not already approved for use. Therefore,
the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR
part 1320 do not apply.
This policy deals with business practices related to timber sale contracts and, as such, has no direct effect on the
amount, location, or manner of timber offered for purchase. Section 31.1b, paragraph 2, of Forest Service Handbook
1909.15 (57 FR 43180; September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in an environmental assessment or impact statement
``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Service-wide administrative procedures, program processes, or
instructions.'' Based on consideration of the comments received and the nature and scope of this policy, the Forest
Service has determined that this rule falls within this category of actions and that no extraordinary circumstances
exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement (40 CFR
1508.4).
The text of the final policy as it will be issued in the Forest Service Manual and Timber Sale Preparation Handbook is
set out at the end of this notice.

Financial Security Measures



Forest Service Manual Chapter 2430, Commercial Timber Sales





2431.33_Discounting. 

The line officer with the authority to make the timber sale may approve the use of discounting procedures set forth
in FSH 2409.18, section 54.4 for an individual timber sale to:

1. Support a need for immediate harvesting, such as an economic incentive for early removal of fire-damaged, insect-damaged,
or wind-thrown timber; 

2. Support the accomplishment of land management objectives; 

3. Provide for optimal utilization of salvage timber. Document the need and rationale for discounting in the environmental
assessment or other environmental documentation prepared for the sale.

The use of discounting on an area-wide basis is permissible upon the Regional Forester's request and the Chief's approval
when remaining volume under contract in an area exceeds 3 times the Allowable Sale Quantity (ASQ) or exceeds 3 or more
years of sold volume whichever is greater. In making this determination, consider total unprocessed volume inventories
held by area purchasers. Base the request to provide a discounting incentive on the need for increasing or providing
an even flow of timber receipts to the Government.



* * * * *





2431.43_Bid Guarantee. 

Require a bid guarantee of 10 percent of the advertised value for National Forest System timber sales.



* * * * *





2432.54_Bid Repudiation. 

Consider a timber sale contract to be repudiated when a timber sale is not consummated because the high bidder fails
to make the downpayment, provide a performance bond, and/or execute the contract. 



2432.54a_Notice to Purchaser. 

The Contracting Officer shall notify the bidder of the repudiation and breach of contract by certified mail. The date
of the receipt of notice shall be the date of the repudiation. Also, include notice that the bidder has breached the
contract and:

1. Is subject to exclusion from bidding on the resale pursuant to 36 CFR 223.86(a)(1).

2. May be required to make downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value, plus 40 percent of the total
bid premium on future Forest Service contracts pursuant to 36 CFR 223.49(e).



2432.54b_Assessment of Damages. 

Assess damages for a repudiated sale in the following manner and sequence:

1. Offer the sale to the second high bidder at the rates bid by the high bidder. If the second high bidder declines the
contract, offer it in turn to remaining bidders in the order of their bids. If any bidder accepts the contract offer
at the high bid rate, assess no damages.

2. If there is no second high bidder, more than one second high bidder (tied), or all bidders decline the contract offer,
attempt to readvertise the repudiated sale within six months of repudiation at appropriate appraised rates.

a. Determine damages based on the difference between the total resale bid value and the total value of the repudiated
contract. Add certain additional costs (such as interest and the cost of resale) as indicated in the applicable provision
of the sample contract prepared for the sale. 

b. If there are no bids on the readvertised sale, base damages on the difference between the readvertised appraised
value and the total bid value of the repudiated contract. Add certain additional costs (such as interest and the cost
of resale) as indicated by the applicable provision of the sample contract prepared for the sale.

3. If the sale is not excepted to be readvertised within 6 months, base damages on the difference between the appraised
value of the repudiated contract as of date of repudiation and the total bid value of the repudiated contract. Add certain
additional costs (such as interest and the cost of resale) as indicated by the applicable provision of the sample contract
prepared for the repudiated sale.

Forest Service Manual Chapter 2450, Timber Sale Contract Administration





FSM 2456.14_Penal Sum of the Performance Bond. 

The penal sum of the performance bond shall be at least 10 percent of the total bid value rounded up to the next $100 when
the bid value is $10,000 or less and the next $1,000 when the bid value exceeds $10,000. The bond may be higher than the
minimum amount of bond if needed to cover work required of the purchaser after the logging season is completed.

54.4_Discount of Payment Rates for Early Harvest. 

Use the procedures of this section for individual sales or on an area-wide basis where discounting has been approved
(FSM 2431.33). Use the following guidelines in establishing discounted rates:

1. Discounting of payment rates for early harvest may only be authorized for scaled sales. 

2. Discount rates are a percentage factor based upon a combination of the interest rate being paid on money being borrowed
by the Treasury at the time of advertisement and the length of time before the sale termination date that material is
cut and scaled, up to a maximum discount of 25%. 

a. Make no discount for material scaled during the 12 months before termination of the sale. 

b. For material scaled 12 to 24 months before termination date, apply a discount factor of 50 percent of the Treasury
rate stated in the advertisement. 

c. For material scaled 24 to 36 months before the termination date, apply a discount factor of 100 percent of the Treasury
rate stated in the advertisement. 

d. For material scaled 36 to 48 months before the termination date, apply a discount factor of 150 percent of the Treasury
rate stated in the advertisement. 

e. For material scaled 48 to 60 months before the termination date, apply a discount factor of 200 percent of the Treasury
rate stated in the advertisement. 

f. For material scaled 60 to 72 months before the termination date, apply a discount factor of 250 percent of the Treasury
rate stated in the advertisement. 

g. Make no discount factor exceeding 25 percent of the bid rates at any time. 

 h. Apply no discount factor that reduces the miminum charge below that needed to ensure cost recovery of small business
opted road construction to be done by the Forest Service or that reduces the minimum charge below base rates. 

i. Apply no discount rate that reduces the minimum charge for a combination of species, product, and unit of measure
listed in the timer sale contract below the advertised rate for that combination. That is, limit the maximum discount
to the bid premium shown for each appraisal group listed.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995, is estimated at $333,125. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Honolulu, Hawaii Geographic Service Area.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions

The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria; The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director or MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.

MBDC's shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on November 12, 1993, by

Effective on January 31, 1994, you are directed to increase the limit for Categories 351/651 to 212,000 dozen

, as provided under the terms of the current bilateral agreement between the Governments of the United States and Guatemala.





The guaranteed access level for Categories 351/651 remains unchanged.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign

Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Proposed Realignment of Naval Air Warfare Center,
Patuxent River, MD


Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of the realignment of Naval Air Warfare
Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, Lexington Park, Maryland. This action is being conducted in
accordance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-510) and the specific 1993
base closure and realignment decisions which became effective in September 1993.
The proposed action involves the relocation of personnel and activities from the Naval Air Systems Command, Arlington,
Virginia, and from NAWCAD Trenton, New Jersey, to NAWCAD Patuxent River and, possibly, to the Naval Electronic Systems
Engineering Activity (NESEA) site, St. Inigoes, Maryland. The Navy was directed to close NESEA St. Inigoes by the
same 1993 base closure and realignment decisions; however, it was decided that the property would not be disposed
of, but would be transferred to the Naval Air Systems Command to support its relocation to southeastern Maryland.
In order to meet the facility and operational requirements of the realigning activities at the two receiving sites,
the realignment will require 500,000 to 700,000 square feet of facilities. These facility and operational requirements
will be met through the utilization of existing space (renovation of buildings) and/or new construction of facilities,
such as administrative buildings, parking structures, test labs and other support facilities. Approximately 3,000
additional personnel, with their dependents, will relocate to support the various activities.
Alternatives addressed in the EIS will focus on means of meeting realignment requirements at NAWCAD Patuxent River,
including alternative construction site locations. The EIS will discuss environmental impacts resulting from
the construction and operation of facilities as well as expected associated impacts to the local communities resulting
from the relocation of military and civilian personnel and their dependents. Major environmental issues that will
be addressed in the EIS will include, but not be limited to, impacts on cultural resources, terrestrial and aquatic
habitats, stormwater runoff, noise, and air quality. Other impacts to be considered will include impacts to community
services, such as school capacity, infrastructure, and traffic. Cumulative impacts associated with the realignment
of all personnel and activities to the region around NAWCAD Patuxent River will be considered.
The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to this action. The Navy will hold a public scoping meeting on Thursday, February 17,
1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Carter Office Building, Leonardtown, Maryland. The meeting will be advertised in
Southern Maryland tri-county area newspapers.
A brief presentation will precede requests for public comment. Navy representatives will be available at this meeting
to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies
and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during
the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit his/her oral comments
to five minutes.
Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics
which the commentor believes the EIS should address. Written statements and or questions regarding the scoping process
should be mailed to: Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Building 407, Patuxent River, Maryland
20670-5409, (Attn: Joan Hinson), telephone (301) 826-7512. All comments must be received no later than
March 28, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Proposed Disposal And Reuse of Naval Air Station Glenview,
Glenview, IL</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
(40 CFR parts 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of Naval Air Station (NAS) Glenview,
Glenview, Illinois.

In accordance with recommendations of the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, the Navy plans to close NAS
Glenview in 1995. Operations conducted at NAS Glenview will be disestablished or relocated to other Department of
Defense locations. The proposed action involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of NAS Glenview
for subsequent reuse.

The Navy intends to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of NAS Glenview based on the reasonably foreseeable
reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified by the Glenview Naval Air Station Community Reuse
Planning Group. It is anticipated that reuse alternatives for NAS Glenview may include, but not be limited to: Aviation,
housing, education or institutional, light industry, office space, wildlife preserve, recreational, or a combination
of those uses. The ``no action'' alternative of Navy retention of NAS Glenview land, buildings, and infrastructure
in caretaker status will also be addressed in the EIS. However, because of the process mandated by the Base Closure
and Realignment Act, selection of the ``no action'' alternative would be considered impracticable for the Navy to
implement.

Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS include, but are not limited to: Air quality, water quality,
wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, and socioeconomic impacts.

The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to the proposed reuse alternatives. The Navy will hold a public scoping meeting on
Thursday, February 17, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m., at the Lyceum Conference Room, Glenbrook South High School Auditorium,
4000 West Lake Avenue, Glenview, Illinois. This meeting will be advertised in area newspapers.

A brief presentation will precede request for public comment.

Navy representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern
to the public. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity
to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of
available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to five minutes.

Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics
which the commenter believes the EIS should address. Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping
process should be mailed no later than 3 March 1994 to: Commanding Officer, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering
Command, P.O. Box 190010, Charleston, SC 29419-9010 (Attn: Mr. Thomas Burst, Code 203), telephone (803) 743-0590.

<DOCTITLE>Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. 



[Docket No. RP94-113-000]



January 13, 1994. 



Take notice that on January 10, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) and Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company (Tennessee) filed a joint petition pursuant to section 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,
18 CFR 385.207, requesting an order approving a stipulation entered into on October 1, 1993. Petitioners state the
stipulation provides for termination of all firm transportation and storage contracts between them, through permanent
assignment of Tennessee capacity to Columbia's customers and through payment of an exit fee to Tennessee by Columbia
for abandonment of unassigned capacity on Tennessee. 

Petitioners state that under the terms of the stipulation Columbia will assign all of its capacity rights under Contract
No. T-2030 (15,637 Dth per day of storage withdrawal under Tennessee's SS-E rate schedule), and under
Contract Nos. T-4613/T-4872 (10,425 Dth per day of firm transportation under Tennessee's FT-B
rate schedule). Columbia would also assign a portion of its rights under Contract No. T-3871 (263,998 Dth per
day of firm transportation under Tennessee's FT-A rate schedule). 

The petitioners further state Columbia will pay Tennessee a negotiated exit fee for termination of the unassigned
portion of Columbia's capacity rights under Contract No. T-3871 and for termination of Contact Nos. T-3869/T-4870
(6,928 Dth per day of firm transportation under Tennessee's FT-B rate schedule). They state the exit fee will
be computed at the time the stipulation becomes effective, based on a formula that takes into account, among other
things, the amount of unassigned capacity, estimates of Tennessee's rates over the term of the contracts, and the
net present value of the nominal claim. Based on assumptions with a January 1, 1995 effective date, petitioners estimate
an exit fee of $36.7 million. 

Petitioners request an order approving recovery of the exit fee in Columbia's rates through its TCRA (transportation
costs rate adjustment) mechanism. They request authorization for Tennessee to retain a portion of the exit fee equal
to the amount it would have collected from Columbia in demand charges for the unassigned capacity through July 1, 1995.
Tennessee proposes to credit the remaining portion of the exit fee to its firm customers through its GSR cost recovery
mechanism. 

Petitioners further request abandonment authorization under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for the following
transportation and exchange services: 



Tennessee 



Rate Schedule T-133 

Rate Schedule T-140 

Rate Schedule T-147 



Tennessee and Columbia 



Tennessee Rate Schedule X-58_Columbia Rate Schedule X-78 

Tennessee Rate Schedule X-60_Columbia Rate Schedule X-90 

Tennessee Rate Schedule X-66_Columbia Rate Schedule X-119 





Comment date: 

February 1, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.



[Docket No. CP94-178-000]



January 14, 1994. 



Take notice that on January 12, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), P. O. Box 1642, Houston,
Texas 77251-1642, filed in Docket No. CP94-178-000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of
the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon by sale certain facilities in the Caillou Island area, Terrebonne
Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 

Specifically, Texas Eastern proposes to abandon, by sale to The Offshore Group, a barge and appurtenant equipment
located in the Caillou Island Field, Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. Texas Eastern states that it was authorized to
construct certain facilities, including the barge, to connect natural gas supplies dedicated to it by Louisiana
Land and Exploration Company (LL&E). LL&E owns compression facilities on the barge which are used to deliver
natural gas to Texas Eastern. LL&E has made arrangements with Texaco, Inc. to provide compression service to
deliver the natural gas to Texas Eastern. LL&E therefore no longer requires Texas Eastern's barge or the facilities
on it. 



Comment date:

3. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.


[Docket No. CP94-182-000]


January 14, 1994.


Take notice that on January 13, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), Post Office Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94-182-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to construct and operate a sales tap to Exxon
Company, U.S.A. (Exxon) under TGPL's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-426-000 pursuant
to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and
open to public inspection. 
Specifically, TGPL proposes to construct and operate a new sales tap to Exxon on TGPL's existing 20-inch South McMullen
Lateral in McMullen County, Texas. TGPL states that it would use the facilities to deliver, on an interruptible basis,
up to 400 Mcf of natural gas per day to Exxon. TGPL would transport the natural gas for Exxon under part 284 of the Commission's
Regulations, it is stated. TGPL states that Exxon would reimburse it for the cost of the facilities. 
TGPL asserts that the new sales tap would not have any significant impact on TGPL's peak day or annual deliveries and
is not prohibited by TGPL's gas tariff. 



Comment date: 

February 28, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



Standard Paragraphs


F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment

<DOCTITLE>Williams Natural Gas Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>


January 25, 1994. 


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Williams Natural Gas Co.


[Docket No. CP94-181-000]



Take notice that on January 13, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (Williams) P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101,
filed in Docket No. CP94-181-000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission
and approval to abandon approximately 73.3 miles of 12-inch and 20-inch transmission pipeline located in Alfalfa
County, Oklahoma and Barber, Harper, Sumner and Sedgwick Counties, Kansas, all as more fully set forth in the application
which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Williams proposes to abandon by reclaim approximately 8.8 miles of 12-inch pipeline and 61.2 miles of 20-inch pipeline
and to abandon in place approximately 3.3 miles of 20-inch pipeline. 
Williams states that all deliveries made from the pipeline to be abandoned have been relocated to an adjacent 6-inch
pipeline, therefore there would be no abandonment of service. Williams states further that the estimated cost of
abandonment would be approximately $227,130 with an estimated salvage value of $525,000. 



Comment date: 

February 15, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.


[Docket No. CP94-188-000]


Take notice that on January 18, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas
77251-1642, filed in Docket No. CP94-188-000 an application pursuant to Sections 7 (b) and (c) of
the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation
of certain new facilities and the abandonment of certain other facilities in its Howell Storage Field, all as more
fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Specifically, Panhandle proposes to construct and operate a new injection/withdrawal well and approximately 225
feet of 8-inch storage well flow line in its Howell Storage Field in Livingston County, Michigan. Panhandle states
that part of the storage field lies directly under the City of Howell where there are no existing injection/withdrawal
wells, which results in this portion of the storage field not being drained efficiently. The proposed well would enable
Panhandle to more efficiently cycle the portion of the storage field under the City of Howell, it is stated. Panhandle
further states that the proposed well would increase the working gas inventory by about 900,000 Mcf, with a corresponding
decrease in the base gas inventory. Panhandle asserts that the new facilities would not increase the certificated
maximum capacity of the field or the maximum peak day withdrawal rate. Panhandle further proposes to connect an existing
well to the new storage well flow line and to abandon in place the 4-inch storage well flow line presently connecting
the existing well to the storage field gathering system. 
Panhandle states that the proposed well would be drilled utilizing new horizontal drilling technology at a location
90 feet from the wellhead of an existing well. Panhandle asserts that because of the experimental nature of the new
well, its drilling and completion are being done in cooperation with the Gas Research Institute (GRI). GRI has agreed
to co-fund this project and will share the technical results with other GRI members. 
Panhandle estimates the cost of the project to be $1,104,200, which will be financed with general funds available
to Panhandle. GRI would contribute $300,000 toward the cost of the project it is stated. 


Comment date: 

February 15, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

3. National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation 
 


[Docket No. CP94-195-000] 



Take notice that on January 24, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square,
Buffalo, New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94-195-000 a request pursuant to   157.205
and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization
to continue to operate facilities constructed on an emergency basis to implement an interruptible transportation
service for a new shipper, Songer Gas Company (Songer), under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-4-000,
pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

National Fuel states that on January 16, 1994, a customer of Songer's notified National Fuel that he and sixteen other
customers were out of gas. It was indicated that a phone call to Mr. Ken Songer revealed that he was planning to thaw out
his wells but that he could not get his tractor started. It is then indicated that on that same day National Fuel installed
a temporary connection to provide service for Songer's customers and subsequently filed a report of emergency transaction
with the Commission. National Fuel states that it proposes to continue the operation of the emergency facility beyond
the sixty-day period permitted under the emergency regulations. 

National Fuel estimates total annual deliveries of 500 Mcf. National Fuel indicates that the facility cost approximately
$850. National Fuel also states that the proposed delivery point is not prohibited by its existing tariff. National
Fuel further states that the addition of the delivery facilities would have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual
deliveries.

<DOCTITLE>PacifiCorp Electric Operations; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



January 27, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Cutler Project, located on the Bear River in Cache and Box Elder Counties,
Utah, near Logan, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's
staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that
issuance of a new license for the project, with appropriate environmental protection and enhancement measures,
would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,

<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>






Clean Air Act; Acid Rain Provisions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of the 1994 EPA SO

2

 Allowance Auctions. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to Title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 73, the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO

2

), a precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece of the SO

2

 control program is the allocation of transferable allowances, or authorizations to emit SO

2

, which are distributed in limited quantities for existing utility units and which eventually must be held by virtually
all utility units to cover their SO

2

 emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources and others, so that market forces may govern
their ultimate use and distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the emissions control burden.
In addition, EPA is directed under Section 416 of the Act to conduct annual sales and auctions of a small portion of allowances
(2.8%) withheld from the total allowances allocated to utilities each year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate
and support such a market in allowances and to provide a public source of allowances, particularly to new units for
which no allowances are allocated. Today, the Acid Rain Division is giving notice of the second annual SO

2

 allowance auctions. The regulations governing the auctions and sales were promulgated on December 17, 1991 (40 CFR
part 73, subpart E). 



EPA has delegated the administration of the EPA allowance auctions to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The auctions
will be conducted under the regulations cited above. Anyone can participate in the EPA auctions and bidders are not
restricted as to the quantity or price of their bid. Allowances sold at the auctions will be sold to the highest bidder
until no allowances remain. The 1994 auctions will consist of one ``spot'' auction and two ``advance'' auctions.
Allowances sold in the spot auction are useable for compliance beginning in 1995. Allowances sold in the 6-year advance
auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2000; allowances sold in the 7-year advance auction are useable for
compliance beginning in 2001. 25,000 allowances will be sold in the 6-year advance auction, which are the unsold allowances
from the 1993 direct sale. 50,000 spot allowances will be sold in the spot auction and 100,000 allowances will be sold
in the 7-year advance auction. Bid Forms for the 1994 auctions must be received by the CBOT by the close of business on
March 22, 1994. The auctions themselves will be conducted on March 28, 1994, with the results announced the next day.


CBOT will also sell in the 1994 auctions any spot, 6-year advance, or 7-year advance allowances that are offered by
others holding allowances in EPA's Allowance Tracking System. However, offered allowances will be sold after the
allowances that were withheld from the utilities, so offered allowances will consequently be sold at a lower price
than the withheld allowances. Owners of offered allowances may set a minimum price for their allowances. To offer

 Allowance Offer Form to EPA by the close of business on March 11, 1994. The auction and sale regulations require that
offer forms be received by EPA no later than 15 business days prior to the date of the auctions, which would be March 4,
1994. However, this year, the date that offer forms must be received by EPA is being extended to March 11, 1994 due to
the delay in the opening of the Allowance Tracking System. This extension will not be implemented permanently and
only applies to the 1994 auctions.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that Puerto Rico is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision Primacy Program.

29, 1989 (54 FR 27486 and 54 FR 27544) respectively.


The USEPA has determined that Puerto Rico's SWTR and TCR regulations are no less stringent than the corresponding
Federal regulations and that Puerto Rico continues to meet all requirements for primary enforcement responsibility
as specified in 40 CFR 142.10.
All interested parties, other than Federal Agencies, may request a public hearing. A request for a public hearing

will be held and a notice will be given in the 

Federal Register

 and a newspaper of general circulation. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional
Administrator. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does
not choose to hold a hearing on his or her own motion, this determination shall become final and effective thirty (30)
days after publication of this 

Federal Register

 Notice.
Any request for a public hearing shall include the following information:
(1) The name, address and telephone number of the individual organization or other entity requesting a hearing;
(2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determination and a brief
statement on information that the requesting person intends to submit at such hearing; and

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL92563, EPA gives notice that the Radiation Cleanup Regulation Subcommittee
of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology's (NACEPT) Environmental Information
and Assessments (EIA) Committee will meet by conference call on Thursday, February 24, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.,
EST. The Subcommittee provides advice to EPA regarding the development of regulations to be applied to sites contaminated
with radioactive material.


The Agency received the benefit of Subcommittee members' views on appropriate risk/cleanup levels, future land
use, and site specific public involvement at the open subcommittee meeting of October 18-19, 1993. This conference
call will provide an update on how those views have helped inform the Agency's decision-making process to date as regulatory
development progresses. There will also be a limited discussion of regulations governing the disposal of wastes
generated during cleanup operations, which are in the preliminary stages of development. This conference call is
primarily intended to provide an intermediate update for subcommittee members. It is anticipated that a full-scale
subcommittee meeting will be held in the Spring for in-depth discussion of all pertinent issues.
For additional information, contact Miles Kahn, Designated Federal Official, Office of Radiation and Indoor Air,
Radiation Studies Division, Mailcode 6603J, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Phone: 202-233-9384
or FAX: 202-233-9650. Individuals wishing to participate in the conference call as audience or commenters
should call the Designated Federal Official as soon as possible, since there is a limited number of conference lines
available.
Members of the public wishing to submit comments on the issues discussed by the subcommittee should submit them in
writing to: USEPA_Mail Stop 6102; Air Docket No. A-93-27; Room M-1500; First Floor, Waterside Mall;

National Wild & Scenic Rivers System; Approval of Application


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DOI.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of approval.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary of the Interior hereby announces approval of an application by the Governor of Arkansas to include segments
of the Cossatot River, Arkansas and its tributary Brushy Creek as state-administered components of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub.
L. 90-542, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1273, 

et seq.

) and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Arkansas, a 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River and
a 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek in Arkansas are hereby designated as state-administered components of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System.



The Secretarial designation covers that part of the Cossatot and Brushy Creek within the boundaries of the Cossatot
River Sate Park-Natural Area in Polk and Howard Counties. This action is based on the designation of the river by the
State of Arkansas and the protection offered this river and its immediate environment by and pursuant to applicable
State laws and regulations.
On July 3, 1990, President Clinton, then the Governor of Arkansas, petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add
the above described segments of the Cossatot River to the National System. On April 22, 1992, Congress added the Cossatot
to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (Pub. L. 102-275). However, the State is pursuing its original
request for Secretarial designation for the following reasons:
1. To officially classify the State-managed river segments as ``Scenic.''
2. To recognize the State Management Plan for the Cossatot River State Park and Natural Area.
3. To refine the current definition of the State's portion of the scenic river corridor.
In response to the Governor's request, the Secretary, through the National Park Service conducted a complete review
of the State application and documents associated with the designation decision. As a result of that review, the Secretary
has determined that the 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River and a 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek in the State's
application should be designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System,
as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
The State of Arkansas has fulfilled the requirements of the Act by designating these segments as components of the
Arkansas System of Natural and Scenic Rivers and by adopting a program of action that will adequately protect the river
from adverse State actions. The National Park Service evaluation of the river concluded that these segments of the
Cossatot River and Brushy Creek meet the criteria for the scenic classification under the Act. Accordingly, the following
river segments are classified as scenic pursuant to section 2(b) of the Act to be administered by State government:


Cossatot River: Scenic_

The 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River within the boundaries of the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area just
above the State Highway 246 crossing, at the Ouachita National Forest boundary in Polk County to the crossing at State
Highway 4 in Howard County.


Brushy Creek: Scenic_

The 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek within the boundaries of the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area in Polk County.
This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy,
Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulation Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as required
by section 4(c) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. A 45-day period for public comment on the State's application and
river management plan and on the environmental assessment of the proposed national designation was provided from
April 15, 1991, to May 31, 1991. All comments received have been carefully considered.
Notice is hereby given that effective upon this date, the above-described river segments are approved for inclusion
in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to be administered by the State of Arkansas.

<DOCTITLE>Outer Continental Shelf, Alaska, Gas and Oil Lease Sale 148 </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minerals Management Service, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Call for information and nominations and notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.







1. 

Authority.

 This Call/NOI is published pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331-1356, (1988)),
and the regulations issued thereunder (30 CFR part 256). 

2. 

Purpose of Call.

 The purpose of the Call is to gather information for proposed OCS Gas and Oil Lease Sale 148. This proposed sale, located
in the Chukchi Sea Planning Area, is tentatively scheduled for June 1997. 

Information and nominations on gas and oil leasing, exploration, and development and production within the Chukchi
Sea Planning Area are sought from all interested parties. This early planning and consultation step is part of the
Area Evaluation and Decision Process and is important for ensuring that all interests and concerns are communicated
to the Department of the Interior for future decisions in the leasing process pursuant to the OCS Lands Act, as amended
(43 U.S.C. 1331-1356) (1988), and regulations at 30 CFR part 256. This Call does not indicate a preliminary decision
to lease in the area described below. Final delineation of the area for possible leasing will be made at a later date
and in compliance with all applicable laws including requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C.
4321 

et seq.

), as amended, and with established departmental procedures. 

3. 

Description of Area. 

The area of this Call, located offshore the State of Alaska in the Chukchi Sea Planning Area as identified on the attached
map, extends offshore from approximately 3 miles to 200 miles, in water depths from around 10 to 100 meters. The area
available for nominations and comments consists of approximately 4,700 whole and partial blocks (about 10 million
hectares or 26 million acres). Respondents may nominate and are asked to comment on any acreage within the entire Call
area. A large-scale map of the Chukchi Sea Planning Area (hereinafter referred to as the Call map), showing boundaries
of the area on a block-by-block basis, and a complete list of Official Protraction Diagrams (OPD's), are available
from the Records Manager, Alaska OCS Region, Minerals Management Service, 949 East 36th Avenue, room 502, Anchorage,
Alaska 99508-4302, telephone (907) 271-6621. The OPD's may be purchased from the Records Manager for
$2 each. Current editions of the listed OPD's are based on the North American Datum of 1983.

4. 

Instructions on Call. 

Respondents are requested to nominate blocks within the Call area that they would like to be considered for inclusion
in proposed OCS Lease Sale 148. Nominations must be depicted on the Call map by outlining the area(s) of interest along
block lines. Respondents are asked to submit a list of whole and partial blocks nominated (by OPD designations) to
facilitate correct interpretation of their nominations on the Call map. Although the identities of those submitting
nominations become a matter of public record, the individual nominations are deemed to be proprietary information.



Respondents are also requested to rank areas nominated according to priority of interest (e.g., Priority 1 (high),
Priority 2 (medium), or Priority 3 (low)). Areas nominated that do not indicate priorities will be considered Priority
3. Respondents are encouraged to be specific in indicating areas or blocks by priority. Blanket priorities on large
areas are not useful in the analysis of industry interest. The telephone number and name of a person to contact in the
respondent's organization for additional information should be included in the response.



Comments are sought from all interested parties about particular geologic, environmental, biological, archaeological,
or social and economic conditions, conflicts, or other information that might bear upon potential leasing and development
in the Call area. Comments are also sought on potential conflicts with approved local coastal management plans (CMP's)
that may result from the proposed sale and future OCS gas and oil activities. If possible, these comments should identify
specific CMP policies of concern, the nature of the conflicts foreseen, and steps that MMS could take to avoid or mitigate
the potential conflicts. Comments may be in terms of broad areas or restricted to particular blocks of concern. Those
submitting comments are requested to list block numbers or outline the subject area on the large-scale Call map.



Nominations and comments must be received no later than 45 days following publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 in envelopes labeled ``Nominations for Proposed Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 148,'' or ``Comments on the Call for Information
and Nominations for Proposed Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 148,'' as appropriate. The original Call map with indications
of interest and/or comments must be submitted to the Regional Supervisor, Leasing and Environment, Alaska OCS Region,
Minerals Management Service, 949 East 36th Avenue, room 603, Anchorage, Alaska 99508-4302.



5. 

Use of Information from Call. 

Information submitted in response to this Call will be used for several purposes. First, responses will be used to
help identify the areas for potential gas and oil development. Second, comments on possible environmental effects
and potential-use conflicts will be used in the analysis of environmental conditions in and near the Call area. The
third program for this Call is to assist in the scoping of the EIS and the development of alternatives to the proposed
action for analysis. The NOI to prepare an EIS is included later in this document. Fourth, comments may be used in developing
lease terms and conditions to ensure safe offshore gas and oil activities. Fifth, comments may be used to point out
potential conflicts between offshore gas and oil activities and the State's CMP.



6. 

Existing Information. 

The Information Base Review (IBR) step was completed in March 1993. The purpose of the IBR is to evaluate the availability
and quality of information relevant to decisions on this proposed Sale.


The IBR for Chukchi Sea Sale 148 included publication of a Request for Interest and Information in December 1992, with
comments due by the end of January 1993, and Information Transfer Meetings in Anchorage, Alaska, in January 1993.
On the basis of the information analyzed during the review process, a determination was made that there is sufficient
information and interest to proceed with the Call.



The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences is conducting a study on environmental information
for gas and oil leasing decisions in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, and Navarin Basin OCS Planning Areas. This study,
expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1994, will examine information needs, costs of obtaining information,
potential improvements in the management and prediction of environmental effects that may result from acquiring
additional information, and alternatives to conducting additional studies. The conclusions of this report can
be considered, along with information received in response to the Call and scoping efforts, in subsequent decisions
in the prelease process.



An extensive environmental, social and economic studies program has been under way in this area since 1975. The emphasis
has been on: geologic mapping; environmental characterization of biologically sensitive habitats; endangered
whales and marine mammals; physical oceanography; ocean-circulation modeling; and ecological effects of gas and
oil activities. A complete listing of available study reports and information for ordering copies may be obtained

Purpose of Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. 

Purusant to the regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) implementing the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), as amended, MMS is announcing its intent to prepare an EIS regarding the gas and oil leasing proposal known as OCS
Gas and Oil Lease Sale 148 Chukchi Sea. Throughout the scoping process, Federal, State, and local governments and
other interested parties have the opportunity to aid MMS in determing the significant issues and alternatives to
be analyzed in the EIS and the possible need for additional information. 

The EIS analysis will focus on the potential environmental effects of leasing, exploration, and development of the
blocks included in the area defined in the Area Identification procedure as the proposed area of the Federal action.
Alternatives to the proposal that may be considered are to delay the sale, cancel the sale, or modify the sale. The Proposed
Final Comprehensive Program 1992-1997 indicated that during the prelease process for this sale, consideration
will be given to establishing a coastal buffer. 

9. 

Instructions on Notice of Intent. 

Federal, State, and local governments and other interested parties are requested to send their written comments
on the scope of the EIS, significant issues that should be addressed, and alternatives that should be considered to
the Regional Supervisor, Leasing and Environment, Alaska OCS Region, at the address stated under Instructions on
Call above. Comments should be enclosed in an envelope labeled ``Comments on the Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS
on the proposed Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 148.'' Comments are due not later than 45 days from publication of this Notice.

<DOCTITLE>Academic Research Infrastructure Program; Notice of Competition</DOCTITLE>



The National Science Foundation announces the FY-1994 competition for the Academic Research Infrastructure
Program. This program is designed to improve the condition of research equipment and facilities in our Nation's academic
institutions in all areas of science traditionally supported by the National Science Foundation. One of the goals
of the program is to assist graduate and undergraduate academic institutions, including those that historically
have received limited Federal research and development funds, to improve their academic science and engineering
infrastructure. The Program consists of two components: instrumentation and facilities modernization. The former
provides support for the acquisition or development of major state-of-the-art research instrumentation. The latter
provides support for the renovation and/or repair of existing science and engineering research and research training
facilities. In FY-1994, separate competitions will be held for instrumentation and facilities modernization.

The Program expects to allocate approximately $50 million in FY-1994 for instrumentation and $50 million for
facilities modernization. Previous proposal success rates for the program have been 26% for instrumentation and
30% for facilities modernization respectively. Awards for instrumentation will range from $100,000 to $2 million
with a required matching/cost sharing at the level between 30-50% for all institutions. Awards for facility
renovation/repair projects will range from $100,000 to $2 million with a required 50% matching/cost sharing on the
part of the submitting institution from Ph.D.-granting institutions or at a level between 20% and 50% from non-Ph.D.-granting
institutions. It is not the intent of the program to fund new construction or expansion of existing facilities. Proposals
may be submitted by institutions of higher education, independent nonprofit research institutions, research museums,
and legally incorporated consortia thereof. Proposals for Instrumentation must be received by March 15, 1994, and
proposals for Facilities Modernization must be received by April 5, 1994. For additional information and proposal
guidelines, call the Office of Science and Technology Infrastructure at (703) 306-1040, or write to: the National
Science Foundation, OSTI, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230, or send email requests to: ari@nsf (BITNET)

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>


Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from January 7, 1994, through
January 21, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2859).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By March 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved. 



Carolina Power & Light Company, Docket No. 50-261, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, Darlington
County, South Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

November 4, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 6.13.1 to provide use of alarming dosimeters in high radiation
areas. This change includes newly revised 10 CFR Part 20 requirement references and is consistent with NUREG-1413,
Standard Technical Specifications - Westinghouse Plants, Specification 5.11.1.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. This change could involve a reduction in personnel radiation exposure by utilizing alarming
dosimeters. This change does not involve any plant systems or components which could increase the probability of
an accident. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. This change could reduce the possibility of an accidental overexposure by alerting personnel when their
maximum allowable exposure has been received. This change does not involve any plant systems or components. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Due to the nature of this
proposed change, it is not related to any plant system. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 27, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, and Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, Technical
Specifications (TS) regarding inspection requirements for pipe snubbers. The proposed changes implement Generic
Letter (GL) 90-09, and would affect the surveillance requirements of TS section 4.7.8 and the bases for these requirements,
section 3/4.7.8. Specifically, the amendment would change the existing inspection periods, visual inspection
acceptance criteria, and functional test requirements. Additionally, there would be changes to the bases to include
reference to GL 90-09, and other editorial changes would be made. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The amended surveillance requirement adds a table that addresses the maximum number of snubber failures that can
be tolerated prior to reducing the inspection interval. This number is a function of the population size of a particular
type of snubber. The revised requirement will allow the inspection intervals to be compatible with the 24 month fuel
cycles, and provisions are included to extend the inspection interval up to 48 months. A provision is included to allow
an evaluation to determine operability to justify continued operation with a snubber that is unacceptable.

The purpose of the amendment request is to provide for alternative inspection intervals that take the size of the population
of a snubber type into account. The proposed change provides the same confidence level and allows snubber inspection
and corrective action to be performed during refueling outages. This allows the plant to avoid a mid-cycle outage
due to a small number of snubber failures.

The proposed change allows for a small percentage of snubbers in each category to fail the required visual examination
without adjusting the inspection frequency. If a statistically significant percentage of snubbers fail, the visual
examination inspection interval is reduced based on the percentage of failed snubbers.

The proposed change has no direct or indirect impact on reactivity management activities.

The change is not expected to have an impact on equipment failures. Any snubbers that fail to meet the visual examination
acceptance criteria are either functionally tested in the as-found condition to verify continued acceptability,
or an evaluation is performed to demonstrate the acceptability of continued operation with an unacceptable snubber.
No new equipment is being introduced and no systems are operated in a configuration that has not been evaluated, so
no new failure modes are introduced.
 
The affected transients are the design basis earthquake and the spectrum of event initiating transients, with the
capability of imposing significant dynamic loads or otherwise which impact the structural integrity of the Reactor
Coolant System (RCS).

The snubbers are installed to ensure the structural integrity of the RCS and required support systems. Their failure
is passive in nature. The probability of a transient initiating event occurring is unrelated to the existence or condition
of equipment that is designed to perform a mitigating function. The snubbers are installed to ensure an acceptable
system response to a dynamic load, and their availability does not impact the frequency of occurrence of earthquakes
or other transients resulting in significant dynamic loading.

The revised testing provisions are designed to allow some flexibility while still maintaining a high probability
that the installed snubbers will be capable of performing their intended function when required. The revised surveillances
appropriately consider the size of the population of a particular type of snubber, and are sufficient to ensure the
consequences of an accident will be unchanged when the revised requirements are implemented. By maintaining a statistically
high level of confidence in the function of the plant's snubbers, the system response to transient initiating events
will be as designed and thus, the off-site dose projected to occur of any affected transient will remain acceptably
low.

As previously stated, the revised surveillance provides a high confidence that the affected systems will remain
intact and functional. Evaluation of the effects of operating with a degraded snubber is required to ensure that adequate
margin exists to support continued plant operation. If this evaluation cannot adequately justify continued operation,
the appropriate action statement will be applied. These provisions are sufficient to assure that the probability
of an equipment malfunction will not increase.

The consequences of equipment malfunction will not increase. Sufficient redundancy exists to accommodate the complete
failure of one train of required equipment. The requisite electrical and physical separation are sufficient to ensure
that the redundant train remains unaffected. This redundancy is adequate to ensure that the undetected failure of
a snubber will not have a severe impact on overall system response to a transient.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The possibility of a new or different type of accident is not created by this change. No new or different equipment is
being introduced, and no system will be operated in a different configuration without first having the effects of
the new configuration evaluated. The new configuration would be system and/or plant operation with a snubber installed
that has failed its visual examination. The required evaluation must be sufficient to provide confidence that continued
operation is acceptable; otherwise, the provisions of the action statement will be observed.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

No reduction in the margin of safety will occur as a result of this proposed change. As previously described, the controls
in place will provide a high confidence the affected systems will continue to be functional. No significant increase
in the rate of occurrence of undetected inoperable snubbers is expected to occur, and the allowable failures prior
to applying an increased test frequency is still a small percentage of the total snubber population.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 2, 1993, supplemented by letter dated January 7, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2, and Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, Technical
Specifications (TS) to allow replacement of the 125 Volt DC Gould batteries with the new 125 Volt DC AT&T batteries
and rephrase their design duty cycle. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise the batteries crosstie loading
limitations and the crosstie breaker limitations. The associated Bases would also be revised to discuss the purpose
for the crosstie limitations and to discuss design duty cycle requirements.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


A. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

The replacement AT&T battery has been selected to meet or exceed the design, functional, and operational requirements
of those of the present Gould battery, including crosstie load limitations. The crosstie breaker limitation change
to allow crosstie between two shutdown units is consistent with the Safety Evaluations issued with Technical Specification
Amendment 5 for both Braidwood and Byron Stations. The remaining changes are administrative in nature or provide
clarification to maintain consistency with other Technical Specifications and the Standard Technical Specifications.


The overall design, function, and operation of the DC system and equipment has not been altered by these changes. The
proposed changes do not affect any accident initiators or precursors and do not alter the design assumptions for the
systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of an accident as analyzed in UFSAR Chapter 15. Therefore,
there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

B. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
 
The replacement AT&T battery will provide the same functions as those of the present Gould battery and will be
operated with the same types of operational controls. These limits will include battery float terminal voltage,
individual cell voltage and electrolyte specific gravity, and crosstie loading. Crosstie conditions are allowed
under the present Technical Specifications. The remaining changes are administrative in nature or provide clarification
to maintain consistency with other Technical Specifications and the Standard Technical Specifications. 

The DC system and its equipment will continue to perform the same functions and be operated in the same fashion. The
proposed change does not create any new or common failure modes. The proposed changes do not introduce any new accident
initiators or precursors, or any new design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences
of an accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated
has not been created. 

C. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The replacement AT&T battery will meet or exceed the design, functional, and qualification requirements of
those of the present Gould batteries. The proposed Technical Specification limitations for the AT&T battery
are derived from the same methodology and margins as those for the Gould battery. Increasing the crosstie loading
limit takes advantage of the larger AT&T battery capacity with its increased design margin. The proposed change
to the crosstie loading limit will continue to conservatively envelop the postulated design requirements. The remaining
changes are administrative in nature or provide clarification to maintain consistency with other Technical Specifications
and the Standard Technical Specifications. 

The inherent design conservatism of the DC system and its equipment has not been altered. The DC system and its equipment
will continue to be operated with the same degree of conservatism. Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of
safety.

10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Illinois




Date of amendment request: 

October 28, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) injection valve stroke times and ECCS
response times for Motor-Operated Valve (MOV) modifications that increase injection valve stroke times. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1) The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because:

The probability of an accident previously evaluated will not increase as a result of this change, because the only
modification being performed is to the stroke times for the LPCS [Low Pressure Core Spray System], LPCI [Low Pressure
Coolant Injection System], and HPCS [High Pressure Core Spray System] injection valves. Changing the opening or
closing time of the injection valves for these ECCS systems does not cause any accident previously evaluated to occur.
Therefore, modifying their stroke times will not increase the probability of occurrence for any accident previously
evaluated.

The consequences of a LOCA [Loss of Coolant Accident] are not significantly increased and do not exceed the previously
accepted licensing criteria for this accident. GE [General Electric Company] has calculated the revised licensing
basis PCT [Peak Centerline Temperature] for LaSalle Station to be 1260
 F, which is well below the 2200
 F criterion of 10 CFR 50.46 and Section 15.6.5 of NUREG-0800 (Standard Review Plan). The acceptance criteria
for cladding oxidation, metal-water reaction (hydrogen generation), coolable geometry and long-term cooling
also continue to be met with the increased valve stroke times.

GE has performed sensitivity analysis justifying the continued applicability of previous analyses for Anticipated
Transients Without Scram (ATWS), containment analyses, off-site dose (Main Steamline Break Outside Containment),
and HPCS-related transients (Loss of Feedwater Flow). Other events are not affected because these systems are not
assumed to function.

2) The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because:

The only modification is to increase the stroke time of the injection valves for LPCS, LPCI, and HPCS. This does not
result in any changed component interactions, other than to increase the affected ECCS response times. The injection
valves will still provide the function for which they were designed. Since the systems will continue to function as
intended, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.

3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:

While the calculated licensing basis PCT is larger than that previously calculated with the current valve stroke
times, the new PCT remains far below the 2200
 F licensing acceptance limit associated with a LOCA. This limit has been previously evaluated as providing
a sufficient margin of safety. All other LOCA licensing limits also continue to be met with the increased stroke times.
For other accidents and transients, the increased stroke times have a negligible effect on the results, so the margin
of safety is preserved.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

April 15, 1992, as modified by letters dated December 8, 1992, and June 25, 1993.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications to incorporate Generic Letter
90-06, ``Resolution of Generic Issue 70, `Power-Operated Relief Valve and Block Valve Reliability,' and Generic
Issue 94, `Additional Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection for Light-Water Reactors,''' power-operated
relief valve (PORV) requirements for power operation, and to modify the primary coolant system (PCS) overpressure
protection specification venting requirements.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed Technical Specification requiring Operability of the PORVs and their block valves does not alter plant
operation or configuration in any way. It is current practice to maintain these valves in an Operable condition to
meet the requirements of existing Specification 3.1.8, which is applicable when below 430
 F. The effect of the proposed changes is to extend the applicability of the Operability requirement for these
valves. The addition of PORV Operability requirements when at Hot Standby and above would not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

Replacing the requirements to vent the PCS through a 1.3 square inch vent with a vent capable of relieving 167 gpm at
a pressure less than the Appendix G limits will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an overpressurization
event occurring. The 1.3 square inch vent area in Technical Specification 3.1.8 was intended to be a means of protecting
the Primary Coolant System (PCS) from exceeding the limit of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, curve following an overpressure
transient. Analysis has shown that manual vent valves PC-514 and PC-515 will provide a relief capacity of 167 gpm at
a PCS pressure of approximately 115 psig, well below the minimum 331 psig limit (Appendix G curve limit for a 40
 F/hr heat-up). This relief capacity will protect the PCS against a pressure transient caused by a maximum charging/letdown
imbalance coincident with a 40
 F/hr PCS heat-up rate and a 60
 F/hr pressurizer heat-up rate.

Two other pressure transients, a High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) pump start and a Primary Coolant Pump (PCP)
start, are also precluded. With the PCS in a vented and depressurized state, the PCS would be below 212
 F Existing technical specifications require both HPSI pumps to be rendered inoperable below 260
 F and, with the system depressurized, normal operating procedures prohibit a PCP start due to insufficient
pump net positive suction head (NPSH).
 
Therefore, the 1.3 square inch requirement can be replaced with a requirement to have a vent capable of relieving 167
gpm at a PCS pressure less than or equal to the Appendix G limit with no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an overpressurization event occurring.
 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The addition of PORV Operability requirements when at Hot Standby and above will not alter plant operation or configuration.
It will not alter any equipment or analyses. Therefore the addition of these PORV Operability requirements will not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The new technical specifications requirements for PCS vent capacity will provide an equivalent or better, overpressure
protection as compared to the existing requirement. No analysis has been found that shows that the existing 1.3 square
inch vent area will protect the PCS from exceeding the Appendix G curve limit. However, analysis has been developed
which shows that manual vent valves PC-514 and PC-515 will provide adequate relief capacity, maintaining PCS pressure
within the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, limits. Furthermore, two other pressure transients, a HPSI pump start and
a PCP start, are also precluded by either existing technical specifications or normal plant operating procedures.

Another related analysis has shown that relief valve RV-3164, the Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI) pumps, the
LPSI pump seals, and the system piping of the shutdown cooling system have the capability of providing adequate overpressure
protection to the shutdown cooling system.

The addition of the manual vent valves do not introduce a vent path where a vent path had not previously existed. Therefore,
the possibility of an accident of a new or different type, than previously evaluated in the FSAR, will not be created.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The margin of safety will not be reduced by the proposed Technical Specifications changes. The extension of PORV Operability
requirements has no effect on any margin of safety. The previous requirement assumed that a vent with an equivalent
flow area as the original PORV would provide the same relief as the PORV itself and gave no consideration to how that
flow area should factor in system losses or vent location. The new technical specification requirement offers a means
to ensure the PCS will be protected against all achievable overpressure transients for the system configuration,
with analyses to support it.

10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County, New Jersey





Date of amendment request: 

December 16, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment clarifies the requirements for maintaining secondary containment integrity when one or
more Reactor Building Ventilation supply and exhaust valves are declared inoperable. The technical specification
(TS) change adds a new Limiting Condition for Operation, Basis Statement, and Surveillance Requirements for these
isolation valves. The change revises TS definition 1.14c, adds new Specifications 3.5.B.2, 3.5.B.3, 4.5.R, and
a Basis statement to TS 3.5, edits T.S. 3.5.B.1.1. It also renumbers TS 3.5.B.2 through 3.5.B.4, to 3.5.B.4 through
3.5.B.7. It also revises specification references within to reflect new specification numbers.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



GPU Nuclear has determined that operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in accordance with the proposed
Technical Specifications does not involve a significant hazard. The changes do not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

The failure of any component in the [Reactor Building Ventilation System] RBVS was not considered as a credible initiating
event for a design basis accident. However, the RBVS is designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential radiological
release by the isolation of all supply and exhaust ducts to the environs. Since the failure of the RBVS was never considered
as one of the initiators of an accident, this proposed change cannot increase the probability of occurrence of an accident.
During the proposed Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), the supply or exhaust duct will be isolated within 8 hours
by one isolation valve secured in its post accident design position. Since the duct can perform its post accident design
function (isolation), there is no increase in the consequences of an accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The design function of the RBVS automatic isolation valves is to isolate the ducts which penetrate the Reactor Building
or Secondary Containment during a radiological release. During the LCO, the duct will be isolated within 8 hours by
one isolation valve secured in the closed position. Since the duct will be isolated, this change will not create a possibility
for an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously identified.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

If a RBVS automatic isolation valve (supply) is declared inoperable, the proposed LCO would allow continued plant
operation with that supply duct isolated. Since the RBVS can still perform its design function (redundant ductwork)
under normal plant and design accident conditions, there is no reduction in the margin of safety. For an inoperable
isolation valve in the exhaust duct, the exhaust duct will be isolated within 8 hours by one isolation valve secured
in the closed position. Further, the RBVS and the [Standby Gas Treatment System] SGTS will be aligned for an accident
condition with no reduction in the margin of safety.

10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment requests: 

November 17, 1993


Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would modify the Technical Specifications to allow a portion of the Waste Gas Holdup System
(WGHS) Explosive Monitoring System to be inoperable for 160 days on a one-time basis. This is to allow replacement
of the Waste Gas Oxygen Analyzer.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


We have evaluated the proposed T/S changes and have determined that the changes should involve no significant hazards
consideration. Operation of the Cook Nuclear Plant in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The purpose of the hydrogen and oxygen monitors is to measure the concentrations of these gases
in the WGHS to ensure that the gas mixture is non-flammable. We can accomplish this purpose and ensure safe operation
of the WGHS by operating the system in the proposed manner. During the equipment replacement interval, we will be assuming
that the hydrogen concentration is above the flammable limit (4%). The limiting factor then is the oxygen concentration
at which hydrogen and oxygen become flammable. The existing hydrogen monitor will be in continuous operation to verify
the hydrogen level. The information provided by the oxygen monitor being replaced is not essential to the safe operation
of the WGHS since it is redundant to information provided by the remaining oxygen monitor. The only difference between
the two (2) oxygen monitors is that the one being replaced provides an automatic isolation of the waste gas decay tank
when the oxygen concentration reaches 3%. The isolation of the waste gas decay tanks will be performed manually during
the replacement. In the event the remaining oxygen monitor becomes inoperable, we will follow the currently approved
T/Ss. Since operation of the WGHS in the manner we have proposed will ensure that the purpose of the oxygen and hydrogen
monitors is fulfilled and safe operation of the WGHS is maintained, the proposed change will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed incident.
 
The proposed change to the Automatic Gas Analyzer (QC-31) tag number to QC-1400 will not reduce in any way requirements
or commitments in the existing T/Ss. The proposed change will eliminate confusion of spare parts of the new analyzer
panel installed in 1990.

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
During the replacement of the monitors the waste gas holdup system will continue to operate normally. The proposed
method of operation will ensure that the oxygen and hydrogen gas mixture is non-flammable. For this reason, operating
the explosive gas monitoring system in the proposed manner will not place the plant in a new or unanalyzed condition.
Therefore, we believe that this change will not introduce a new or different kind of accident than previously analyzed.

The proposed editorial change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated, because these changes will not place the plant in a new or unanalyzed condition.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The remaining oxygen monitor
will be available to maintain the oxygen concentration below the limit required for hydrogen flammability in oxygen.
In addition, the oxygen grab samples will provide redundant information and will serve as a check of the monitor's
readings. If the remaining monitor becomes inoperable, we will follow the actions of our current T/Ss. During the
equipment replacement period, we will be assuming that the hydrogen concentration is above the flammable limit (4%).
This will then make the oxygen level the controlling parameter in a possible flammable combination of oxygen and hydrogen.
The existing hydrogen monitor will be in continuous operation to verify the hydrogen level. These proposed interim
measures will not significantly affect our ability to maintain the hydrogen and oxygen concentration within the
limits to prevent flammability. Therefore, we believe that operation of the system in this manner does not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed editorial change will not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety, because all accident
analyses and nuclear design bases remain unchanged.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve
no significant hazards consideration.

December 20, 1993


Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications to change Train A and B Emergency Loads from 8 hour
to composite 4 hour, delete a load on the Train B batteries load list, and revise the operational loads on the Train N
batteries.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration if the change does not:

(1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



Criterion 1

The change is proposed to comply with the LOCA/LOOP [loss-of-coolant accident/loss-of-offsite power] and SBO [Station
Blackout] requirement for Cook Nuclear Plant for battery testing. The composite test as addressed above meets these
requirements for four hour test profiles. This change is consistent with the UFSAR three hour LOCA/LOOP and NUMARC
87-00 Station Blackout Rule four hour. Based on these considerations, the proposed change does not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Criterion 2

The change only addresses the battery profile test which meets both LOCA/LOOP and SBO for Cook Nuclear Plant. No specific
physical or operational changes to the plant will occur due to this change. Thus, the change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Criterion 3

The proposed change revises the battery profile test table from an eight hour to a four composite test which complies
with both LOCA/LOOP and SBO as defined for Cook Nuclear Plant. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of

Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications section addressing steam generator stop valves
making it more consistent with the revised Standard Technical Specifications and clarifying certain surveillance
requirements.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration if the change does not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or

3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



Criterion 1

The limiting conditions for operation involving the steam generator stop valves are not altered by this proposed
change. The surveillance requirements are lessened for Unit 2 in that valve stroke timing does not have to be performed
on valves that are closed. This is consistent with the wording of the Unit 1 T/S, and reflects the fact that, when closed,
the valves are already in the position required by the assumptions in the safety analysis and therefore stroke timing
is not necessary. The remaining changes are consistent with NUREG 1431, and as such, have already been found acceptable
by the NRC. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Criterion 2

No changes to the limiting conditions for operation of the steam generator stop valves are proposed as part of this
amendment request. The proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to the plant. The changes will allow operation
in Modes 2 and 3 with more than one steam generator stop valve inoperable. However, inoperable valves must be closed
and their closure periodically reverified. When closed, the valves are already in the position required by the assumptions
in the safety analysis. Thus, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

Criterion 3
 
The limiting conditions for operation involving the steam generator stop valves are not altered by this proposed
change. The surveillance requirements are lessened for Unit 2 in that valve stroke timing does not have to be performed
on valves that are closed. This is consistent with the wording of the Unit 1 T/S, and reflects the fact that, when closed,

Date of amendment request: 

December 22, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.4.e (Emergency Ventilation System). TS 3.4.4.e
currently permits fuel handling operations to continue during refueling for up to 7 days with one circuit of the emergency
ventilation system inoperable provided all active components of the other emergency ventilation system circuit
are operable. The proposed revision would permit fuel handling operations to continue during refueling beyond 7
days with one circuit of the emergency ventilation system inoperable provided the remaining emergency ventilation
system circuit is operable and in operation. The licensee stated that the proposed revision is consistent with recently
issued Amendment No. 47 to the Nine Mile Point Unit 2 TSs and with the NRC's Improved Standard Technical Specifications,
NUREG-1433.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The Emergency Ventilation System responds to a release of radioactivity to the secondary containment by maintaining
a negative pressure in secondary containment and by providing a filtered elevated release. The proposed change to
LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] 3.4.4.e would allow continuation of refueling beyond seven days with one
emergency ventilation circuit inoperable provided the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation.
A plant specific PRA [Probabilistic Risk Assessment] was performed to evaluate the probability of a fuel bundle drop
event resulting in a need to start the Emergency Ventilation System with a concurrent failure of the Emergency Ventilation
System that would result in an unfiltered ground level release under the current Technical Specifications and the
proposed change. The results of this assessment indicate that the probability is not significantly increased. In
addition, the order of magnitude of the probability of such a release, under the current or proposed Technical Specifications,
is very small, i.e., 10

-6

. This amendment requires no physical changes to NMP1. Therefore, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications
do not significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated.

Section XV.C.3 of the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] evaluates a fuel bundle drop accident. The radiological
consequences of this accident are within the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100. The UFSAR radiological evaluation takes
credit for the operation of an emergency ventilation circuit in mitigating the consequences of this accident. During
refueling with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable for more than seven days, the proposed Technical Specification
change would require that an operable emergency ventilation circuit be placed in operation. With an operable emergency
ventilation circuit operating prior to a fuel bundle drop accident, the radiological consequences of this accident
remains bounded by the current UFSAR evaluation. Therefore, from a radiological perspective, the proposed Technical
Specification change is bounded by the current radiological evaluation in the UFSAR. Therefore, the Technical Specification
change does not significantly increase the consequences of a previously evaluated accident.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

This amendment does not involve any accident precursors or initiators. During an accident involving the release
of radioactivity to the secondary containment atmosphere an operable emergency ventilation circuit would already
be running and performing its safety function. The operating status of a running emergency ventilation circuit,
which was manually started, would be unaffected by the receipt of an automatic start signal due to the detection of
high radiation in secondary containment. Accordingly, the proposed Technical Specification change will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The current Technical Specifications, LCO 3.4.4, provide a margin of safety by requiring both emergency ventilation
circuits to be operable during a refueling condition. With one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable, the current
Technical Specifications allow continuation of refueling for up to seven days, at which time refueling must be stopped.
This Technical Specification requirement ensures that an emergency ventilation circuit will be available to provide
a filtered release to the environment during an accident which could result in the release of radioactivity to the
secondary containment atmosphere.

The proposed change to LCO 3.4.4.e would allow continuation of refueling beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation
circuit inoperable provided the operable emergency ventilation circuit is in operation. By placing the remaining
operable emergency ventilation circuit in operation, active single failures associated with its startup have been
eliminated. These eliminated failures include automatic initiation instrumentation, relaying logic, breaker
operation, fan startup and valve operation. With an operable emergency ventilation circuit in operation, its safety
function is being performed. In addition, the status of the operating emergency ventilation circuit is indicated
in the control room. Therefore, the running, operable emergency ventilation circuit provides a level of safety comparable
to two non-running, operable emergency ventilation circuits.

Based upon the above analysis, the margin of safety is not significantly reduced by allowing refueling to continue
beyond seven days with one emergency ventilation circuit inoperable since the operable emergency ventilation circuit
is in operation.

These changes are consistent with Amendment No. 47 for Nine Mile Point Unit 2 and with the Improved Standard Technical
Specifications, NUREG-1433.

Accordingly, as determined by the analysis above, this proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

December 27, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would relocate Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.2.7, ``Reactor Coolant Isolation
Valves,'' and 3.3.4, ``Primary Containment Isolation Valves,'' from TS 3.2.7/4.2.7 and 3.3.4/4.3.4, respectively,
to a plant procedure overning lists removed from TSs per Generic Letter (GL) 91-08, ``Removal of Component Lists from
Technical Specifications.'' The plant procedure would be subject to the requirements specified in the Administrative
Controls section of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (NMP-1) TS. The proposed amendment would also make
conforming changes to the TS Bases. These lists of valves will continue to be included in the NMP-1 Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (FSAR). The licensee stated that the proposed changes would be consistent with NRC staff guidance
issued in GL 91-08. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

1.The proposed amendment does not involve a physical change to any system, structure, or component that affects the
probability or consequences of any accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety.

Relocation of the component lists to plant procedures and the Updated FSAR is in accordance with Generic Letter 91-08.
This change does not alter the existing operability or surveillance requirements for the components to which they
apply. The proposed changes are under the change control provisions in Section 6.0, ``Administrative Controls,''
of the Technical Specifications. The changes associated with the Bases for Specification[s] 3.2.7/4.2.7 and 3.3.4/4.3.4
are consistent with the issuance of prior license amendments. Since the proposed amendment does not affect the operation
or testing of any plant systems or components, it will have no impact on the probability or consequences of accidents
or malfunctions previously evaluated.

2.The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.2.7/4.2.7, 3.3.4/4.3.4 and Bases do not introduce any new modes
of plant operation or new accident precursors, involve any physical alterations to plant configurations, or make
changes to system setpoints which could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The proposed changes relocate
Reactor Coolant Primary Containment Isolation Valve Tables 3.2.7 and 3.3.4 into a procedure governing controlled
lists removed from TS per Generic Letter 91-08 under the change control provisions in Section 6.0, ``Administrative
Controls,'' of the Technical Specifications. The testing associated with these valves remains unchanged, therefore,
it will not affect system or component operability. In addition, the removal of generic reference to the 60 second
closure time is consistent with previously issued license amendments and has no impact on either the Limiting Condition
for Operation or Surveillance Requirement. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

The Technical Specification Limiting Conditions for Operation and Surveillance Requirements for the valves listed
in Tables 3.2.7 and 3.3.4 are not being altered. The valve lists will be incorporated into a procedure governing controlled
lists removed from TS per Generic Letter 91-08. This is controlled by Section 6.0, ``Administrative Procedures.''

In addition, removal of generic reference to the 60 second closure time is consistent with previously issued license
amendments and has no impact on either the Limiting Conditions for Operation or Surveillance Requirements. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

October 4, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would delete the emergency diesel-generator engine speed specification from Surveillance
Requirement (SR) 4.8.1.1.2a.5 and would replace the diesel engine speed requirement with an electrical frequency
requirement in SR 4.8.1.1.2g. Currently, SR 4.8.1.1.2a.5 specifies both a minimum engine speed and a nominal electrical
frequency and acceptable deviation from the nominal value. SR 4.8.1.1.2g currently specifies only a minimum engine
speed. The specified minimum engine speed is not consistent with the acceptable frequency deviation below the nominal
value.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below.


A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes merely delete the specification of emergency diesel-generator
minimum engine speed while retaining or substituting the specification of electrical frequency to be attained by
the emergency diesel-generator. The diesel engine and generator are directly coupled and must rotate at the same
speed, therefore, speed and frequency are directly related and specification of acceptance values for both parameters
is redundant. Furthermore, electrical frequency, not engine speed, is the parameter of interest with regard the
ability of the system to power emergency loads. The proposed changes do not affect the adequacy of the surveillance
test or the reliability of the system to power emergency loads, and do not involve any physical changes to facility
structures, systems, or components. Therefore, since the reliability of the emergency diesel-generators will
not be reduced, the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated is not increased.
B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because no physical changes to facility
structures, systems, or components are involved and they do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated.

C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed
changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated or involve changes to equipment or features which
affect the operational characteristics of the facility. 
 Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

October 28, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would implement 13 of the 47 line item Technical Specification (TS) improvements recommended
by Generic Letter 93-05. Most of the proposed changes would revise the allowable time intervals for performing certain
Surveillance Requirements (SR) on various plant components during power operation or would delete the requirement
entirely or under certain conditions. One proposed change would modify testing requirements identified in an ACTION
statement. The specific changes are as follows:
1. 

SR 4.1.3.1.2

 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of any partially or fully withdrawn control
rod would be increased to 92 days from 31 days.
2. 

SR 4.6.4.1

 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of the hydrogen monitors by performing an Analog
Channel Operational Test (ACOT) would be increased to 92 days from 31 days, and by performing a Channel Calibration
to every refueling outage from 92 days on a staggered basis.
3. 

SR 4.3.2.1, Table 4.3-2, Functional Unit 3.c.4 and SR 4.3.3.1, Table 4.3-3, Functional Units 1 through 6

 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of the radiation monitors by performing an
ACOT and Digital Channel Operational Test (DCOT) would be increased to quarterly from monthly.
4. 

SR 4.4.6.2.2

- The time the plant may be in Cold Shutdown before Pressure Isolation Valve testing is required prior to entering Mode
2 would be increased to 7 days from 72 hours.
5. 

SR 4.4.11.1

 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate the operability of the Reactor Coolant System vent block valves
would be increased to cold shutdown from every 92 days.
6. 

SR 4.4.3.2

 - The allowable interval between tests to verify pressurizer heater capacity would be increased to each refueling
outage from 92 days.


7. 

SR 4.5.1.1.1

 - The requirement to verify the boron concentration of the accumulator contents after a volume increase of 1-percent
or more would be removed under certain conditions.
8. 

SR 4.5.1.1.2

 - The requirement to perform an ACOT and Channel Calibration on accumulator water level and pressure instrumentation
would be deleted.


9. 

SR 4.5.2

 - The requirement to visually inspect the containment sump upon completion of each containment entry would be modified
to avoid unnecessary containment sump inspections when multiple containment entries are made on the same day. 
10. 

SR 4.6.2.1

 - The allowable interval between tests to verify that each containment spray nozzle is unobstructed would be increased
to every 10 years from 5 years.
11. 

SR 4.6.4.2

 - The allowable interval between tests to demonstrate operability of each hydrogen recombiner system would be increased
to each refueling interval from 6 months.
12. 

SR 4.7.1.2.1

 - The allowable interval between tests of the auxiliary and startup feedwater pumps would be increased to 92 days on
a staggered test basis from 31 days.
13. 

TS 3.8.1.1

 - The ACTION statements would be changed so that when the Limiting Conditions for Operation are not met due to:
a. Inoperability of one or two offsite power circuits the starting of a diesel-generator would no longer be required;
b. Inoperability of one diesel-generator, starting of the remaining diesel-generator would be required within
8 hours only under certain conditions instead of within 24 hours under all conditions;
c. Inoperability of a diesel-generator and an offsite power circuit, starting of the remaining diesel-generator
would be required within 8 hours only under certain conditions instead of within 24 hours under all conditions.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below. 
A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes either merely modify the allowable intervals between
certain surveillance tests, delete the SR, or alter an ACTION statement with regard to required testing. The safety
functions of the related structures, systems, or components are not changed in any manner nor are the reliabilities
of any structure, system, or component reduced by the revised surveillance or testing requirements. The changes
do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature, structure,
system, or component. Since there is no change to the facility or operating procedures, and the safety functions and
reliabilities of structures, systems, or components are not affected, there is no affect upon the probability or
consequences of any accident previously analyzed.
B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because they do not change the facility or
affect the manner by which the facility is operated. The proposed changes merely change certain surveillance or testing
requirements.
C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because they do not
affect the manner by which the facility is operated or change equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics
of the facility.
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

December 17, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment changes the action statements for the limiting conditions associated with the electrical
power sources (Technical Specification 3.8.1.1).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92, NNECO has reviewed the attached proposed changes and has concluded that they do not
involve a significant hazards consideration. The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes
would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes to rewrite the action statements for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 will decrease the wear
on the EDGs [emergency diesel generators] by reducing the number of required starts. These changes will also allow
adequate time for the completion of manufacturer recommended EDG engine prelube and warmup procedures. They ensure
that the operability of the AC sources is demonstrated with reasonable assurance. Also, the reliability of the EDGs
will be enhanced by reducing the potential for numerous unloaded EDG starts during an LCO [limiting condition for
operation] period. The proposed changes could reduce the number of required unloaded EDG starts from nine to one.
Therefore, these proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes to rewrite the action statements for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 do not alter the method
of operating the plant, nor do they introduce any new failure modes. The proposed changes affect EDG testing frequency
only, they have no impact on any accident analysis. The proposed changes provide assurance that the EDGs will be able
to power their respective safety systems if required. Also, they do not involve any physical alterations to plant
equipment or procedures which would introduce any new or unique operational modes or accident precursors.

3.Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes to rewrite the action statements for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 do not affect the capability
of the EDGs to perform their function. The intent of the changes is to increase the overall EDG reliability, by reducing
the wear resulting from excessive and unwarranted testing. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 12, 1992, as supplemented September 17, 1992, March 17, 1993, August 17, 1993, August 18, 1993, and December 29,
1993.


Description of amendment request: 

The purpose of the proposed changes is to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to permit operation of the James
A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant at an uprated power of 2536 MWt. The licensee's engineering analyses and evaluations
confirm that the plant can be operated at an uprated power. The increase in the rated power from 2436 MWt to 2536 MWt corresponds
to a 4.8 percent increase in rated steam flow. The increase in rated power remains below the plant design power level
of 2550 MWt which was the basis for the original plant safety evaluation.
The changes affect the operating parameters of the reactor, operational restrictions, setpoints for safety systems,
analytical results, and test requirements. There are also administrative changes. The changes in each of these categories
are summarized as follows:
Reactor Parameters: The effect on reactor parameters is limited. Higher power is achieved by control rod pattern
adjustments to increase reactor thermal power in a more uniform (flattened) power
distribution to increase steam flow without increasing core recirculation flow. This requires an increased reactor
dome pressure for adequate turbine inlet pressure.
Operational Limits: The increased thermal power requires a change to the limitation on operation in the high power
low flow portion of the power/flow map to limit thermal hydraulic instabilities and power oscillations.
Setpoints: The increased reactor pressure has a direct impact on the high pressure scram setpoint and the safety relief
valve setpoint. Additionally, the bypass for the turbine stop valve closure and control valve fast closure scram
will be changed in proportion to the increase in thermal power.
Analysis Results: Analyses of uprated power transients and accidents requires changes to various TS and their Bases.
Operational parameters and assumptions used in analyses were revised to reflect their use as initial conditions.
Revised radiological analyses changed dose results. The results of the accident analyses requires revisions to
properly reflect plant capabilities.
Testing: A number of changes to testing requirements result from power uprate. The increase to reactor pressure has
a direct effect on hydrostatic leakage testing pressure. The test pressure for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI)
and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) pumps will be revised to reflect safety relief valve setpoints assumed
in analyses.
Administrative: Administrative changes (i.e., adding references, revising references and correcting associated
errors) will also be made.
 
No changes to the Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications were identified.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant at a thermal power of 2536 MWt will not involve a significant hazards consideration
as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant was reviewed for operation at a rated power of 2550 MWt at the time of its
operating license, [***]. This review was based on the original design of the plant. Since that time, a number of safety
issues of a generic and plant specific nature as well as plant modifications have changed the originally reviewed
design.

Generic criteria, methodologies and evaluation scope required to uprate BWRs up to 5% were prepared by General Electric
and submitted to the NRC in LTR-1 [NEDC-31897P-A, ``Generic Guidelines for General Electric Boiling Water Reactor
Power Uprate"]. This was supplemented by the submittal of generic evaluations in LTR-2 [NEDC-31984P, ``Generic
Evaluations of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate'' and Supplement 1] to determine: which NRC and
industry generic communications were applicable to power uprate and how they should be treated; analytical evaluations
that could be generically approved; bounding evaluations of components and equipment, and; the effect of power uprate
on safety margin. These generic evaluations are supplemented by plant specific evaluations. The Power Uprate Safety
Analysis Report (PUSAR) describes the dependence placed on References 1 and 2, the additional analyses that were
performed, the results of these additional analyses and overall conclusions on the safety impacts of power uprate.

The plant systems and components will be within design limits at power uprate conditions with minor modifications.
At uprated power, the power plant will not be operated in a manner that is different from current operations except
for limited changes to operating parameters such as primary system pressure, steam flow and feedwater temperature.
Setpoints are revised as necessary to reflect new operational conditions and analyses. The ECCS-LOCA [emergency
core cooling system-loss-of-coolant accident] analysis using current practices demonstrates compliance with
design and regulatory acceptance criteria at uprated power.



The radiological consequences of accidents have been evaluated using more current methodologies with consistent
assumptions and continue to meet acceptance criteria. Compliance with NRC dose criteria using current methodologies
is discussed in Section 9.2 of the PUSAR. The effect of power uprate on dose analyses now discussed in the FSAR [Final
Safety Analysis Report] were qualitatively assessed recognizing that power uprate increases doses in direct proportion
to the 4.1% increase in thermal power. An increase of 4.1% to the calculated doses currently identified in FSAR Chapter
14 indicates that a reevaluation using the original methodology would have demonstrated compliance with current
NRC dose criteria. A review of Table 14.4-2 indicates that, with the 4.1% increase, offsite doses would be substantially
less than NRC allowable values. A review of Table 14.8-1 indicates that, with the 4.1% increase, control room doses
would be substantially less than NRC allowables except for the main steam line break (MSLB). However, the MSLB dose
would drop well below allowables once the proposed change on allowable coolant activity (reduces the limit by more
than a factor of ten) is accounted for.

[Thus, based on the above analysis and supplemental analyses performed by the NRC staff, the increase in power level
discussed herein and associated Technical Specification changes do not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.]

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Operation at uprated power involves no changes to the manner in which the plant is operated. There are changes to operational
parameters and setpoints but analyses of these identified no new failure modes or accident scenarios. The effects
of transients and accidents fall within design capabilities. Systems and components are capable of operating and
performing their safety functions at uprated power. No mechanisms for creating a new or different accident were identified.

3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The power uprate will not result in significant increases to primary system temperature and pressure due to postulated
operating transients or accidents. These and other margins of safety have been discussed in the PUSAR, where it is
demonstrated that there will be no reductions in the margin of safety because the plant will still meet its design and
regulatory acceptance criteria. For example, the core will continue to be operated with the same margin to the safety
limit minimum critical power ratio. Fuel thermal limits will continue to meet NRC acceptance criteria. Plant systems
and equipment are designed for uprated power conditions and have been evaluated for their capability to perform at
uprated conditions. They will continue to perform within design limits.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

New York




Date of amendment request: 

December 22, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications proposes to remove the reference to
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard D 270-65 from Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i.
ASTM D 270-65, which specifies procedures to draw a representative fuel oil sample, has been superseded and is no longer
in effect. The FitzPatrick Surveillance Procedure currently requires sampling in accordance with ASTM D 270-65
but notes that it has been superseded by ASTM D 4057-88. The proposed change makes Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i
consistent with fuel oil Surveillance Requirement 4.9.C.1, for the emergency diesel generators (EDGs), by adopting
the current industry fuel oil sampling standard. There are no changes to the acceptance criteria for fuel oil quality
which are based on ASTM D 975-81.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Plant accident analyses are not affected by the Technical Specification change. The change removes reference to
ASTM D 270-65 as the method for obtaining samples of diesel fuel oil from Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i. The
American Society for Testing and Materials has superseded ASTM D 270-65 with ASTM D 4057. The proposed change provides
improved flexibility to adopt standards as they are issued without requiring a license amendment and makes Surveillance
Requirement 4.12.A.1.i consistent with both Surveillance Requirement 4.9.C.1 for the EDG and the STS [Standard
Technical Specification]. The nature of this change will not cause any increase in the probability or consequences
of previously evaluated accidents.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The proposed change involves no hardware modifications to any plant structures, systems or components. The change
removes reference to ASTM D 270-65 as the method for obtaining samples of diesel fuel oil from Surveillance Requirement
4.12.A.1.i. The American Society for Testing and Materials has superseded ASTM D 270-65 with ASTM D 4057. The nature
of this change is such that no new or different kind of accident can be created.

3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change will not cause a reduction in the margin of safety. The results of the plant accident analyses continue
to bound operation under the proposed changes so there is no reduction in the margin of safety. The change removes reference
to ASTM D 270-65 to allow the use of ASTM D 4057-88 as the method for obtaining samples of diesel fire pump fuel oil. The
change will make Surveillance Requirement 4.12.A.1.i consistent with existing Surveillance Requirement 4.9.C.1
for the EDG and allow current standards to be used for fuel oil sampling. Revisions of this nature will not cause a reduction
in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

December 28, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TSs) revises the scope of startup and
power escalation reports to reflect the guidance provided by the Standard Technical Specifications (STS). Current
TS requirements state, ``The report shall address each of the tests identified in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report] ....'' 
The list of tests provided in the FSAR includes many tests which were required for the initial plant startup but are
not performed for subsequent startups. Currently, the licensee satisfies TS requirements in the startup reports
by identifying tests which are not performed, their purpose, and the reason for not performing them.
The inclusion of such a section in the startup reports is unnecessary. This amendment would revise the TSs to permit
subsequent startup reports to address only those tests that are actually performed.


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
 
The proposed changes involve no hardware modifications, no changes to the operation of any system or component, no
changes to structures, and alters future startup reports by addressing only tests that are performed. A change in
reporting format will not eliminate the performance of startup tests that are necessary or required. These changes
can not alter the probability or consequences of existing accident analyses as documented in the FSAR or the NRC staff
SER [Safety Evaluation Report].

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The changes do not alter the testing procedures or methodologies. The changes provide a basis, in accordance with
NRC guidance, for allowing future startup test reports to mention and discuss only those tests that are actually performed.
These changes can not result in a new or different type of accident than those previously evaluated.
 
3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

There are no changes to tests that are performed in support of plant startup [***]. Removing a requirement for reporting
on tests that are not performed will not cause a reduction in any margin of safety.





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

Date of amendment request:

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications would eliminate an inconsistency between
the Reactor Coolant System (RSC) leakage detection and operability requirements in Limiting Conditions for Operation
(LCO) 3.6.D.1 and 3.6.D.4.
LCO 3.6.D.1 currently requires that RCS leakage be below specified limits when there is irradiated fuel in the reactor
vessel and reactor coolant temperature is greater than 212
 F. LCO 3.6.D.4 requires the leakage monitoring systems to be operable during power operation (i.e., when the
mode switch is in the Startup/Hot Standby position or the Run position with the reactor critical above 1 percent rated
power, as defined per Specification 1.0.O). These two LCOs are not consistent. The proposed revision of LCO 3.6.D.4
will take the more conservative approach of requiring the leakage monitoring systems to be operable when the leakage
limits of LCO 3.6.D.1 are in effect.
The proposed changes also make editorial corrections which are considered administrative in nature.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and
no changes to structures. It alters an LCO to require plant leakage detection systems to be operable during the same
plant conditions that RCS leakage limits apply. The revised LCO requires leakage detection systems in operational
modes consistent with other portions of the Technical Specifications. Additional changes include editorial corrections
such as correct specification numbering, proper system identification, and clarification of a surveillance requirement
cross reference. Since the change to the LCO for leakage detection will require operability under a greater range
of plant conditions to be consistent with detection requirements, there is no change to previously determined accident
probabilities or consequences. The editorial changes have no adverse safety implications.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and
no changes to structures. It alters the Technical Specifications only to the extent of making two LCOs consistent
by requiring the leakage detection system to be operable when leakage limits apply and making editorial changes.
Editorial changes and increasing the plant conditions for leakage system operability can not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated since the editorial changes have no safety significance
and the operability changes are being made for consistency with the modes when leakage detection is required to function.

3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment revisions involve no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems and no changes
to structures. The revised LCO criteria for RCS leakage detection system operability has increased the plant conditions
when operability is required to match the plant conditions when leakage limits apply. Editorial changes and expanded
operability requirements in the LCOs will not result in any change to existing safety margins.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

December 29, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

This proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications, Appendix B, revises Surveillance
Requirement 3.1.a and Table 3.10-2. The existing Surveillance Requirement in Specification 3.1.a, which references
Table 3.10-2, requires the performance of instrument checks, tests, and calibrations to assure the operability
of specific gaseous effluent radiation monitors. It does not require any surveillances for the associated data recorders.
However, Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.a specifically states that ''...pathways shall be monitored
and recorded ....'' which requires the recorders to be operable for the gaseous effluent monitoring system to be considered
operable. The proposed changes to the Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications (RETS) add the radiation
monitor recorders to the Surveillance Requirement and Table 3.10-2 for the gaseous effluent monitoring system.
This will provide the surveillance requirements for the data recorders.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
 
The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and
no changes to structures. It alters procedures by including the recorders in the Surveillance Requirements for determining
the operability of the radiological monitoring/recording instrumentation. The inclusion of the data recorders
in the Surveillance Requirements for checking, testing, and calibration does not reduce gaseous effluent monitoring
capability while providing greater assurance that data is recorded. Adding the existing system surveillance to
the Technical Specifications will not have any affect on previously evaluated accident probabilities or consequences.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems or components and
no changes to structures. It alters procedures by including the data recorders in the Surveillance Requirements
for the radiation monitors. These changes do not affect the manner in which the gaseous effluent radiation monitoring
system is operated or tested. The resulting changes do not pose a safety issue concern different from those analyzed
previously in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] or the NRC staff SER [Safety Evaluation Report].

3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment involves no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems and no changes to structures.
It alters procedures by including the data recorders in the Surveillance Requirements for the radiation monitors.
The revised surveillance requirement increases the scope of surveillance for the gaseous effluent radiation monitoring
system, for consistency with the LCO. It does not cause any reduction in any safety margins.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

New York




Date of amendment request: 

January 11, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This proposed amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications (TS) would temporarily waive the 2-year
maximum surveillance interval for the Type C test (local leak rate test) of the shutdown cooling isolation valves
(10MOV-17 and 10MOV-18). The waiver would permit deferring this test until the next refueling outage, currently
scheduled for the end of November 1994.
TS 4.7.A.2.e(5) and 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix J require the containment isolation valves to be leak-rate tested during
each refueling outage, but at intervals of not greater than 2 years. As a result of the extended 1991-1993 refueling
outage, and the length of the current operating cycle, tests of all containment isolation valves are due prior to the
start of the next refueling outage. Two mid-cycle outages were scheduled, in part, to accommodate the testing of these
valves, except for the shutdown cooling isolation valves. The shutdown cooling isolation valves cannot be removed
from service during a non-refueling outage to accommodate a leak-rate test since its associated system is needed
to remove reactor decay heat. The reliability of the isolation valve design, and the very low probability that the
shutdown cooling system penetration would result in a pathway for leakage to the reactor building, as discussed in
the application, is provided as justification for this one-time schedular extension.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change is limited to a one-time schedular extension in the shutdown cooling isolation valve Type C test.
The change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation, make any physical changes, or alter any operational
setpoints. Therefore, the change does not degrade the performance of any safety system assumed to function in the
accident analysis. The extension will not result in a significant increase in valve leakage considering that: (1)
the valves are infrequently stroked, and then only when the reactor vessel is at low pressure, (2) monitoring the normal
operating status of the RHR [residual heat removal] system assures the absence of gross valve leakage, and (3) the
valves were replaced with valves of an improved design which has been confirmed by past Type C tests to exhibit satisfactory
leak rate performance. For these reasons, the change does not involve a significant increase in the probability of
an accident.

The change does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident evaluated since any leakage
through the shutdown cooling penetration will not significantly increase for reasons discussed in the previous
paragraph, and such leakage is negligible compared to the main steam line break accident analyzed in the FSAR [final
safety analysis report].

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since the change does not alter
the physical characteristics of any plant system or component. The change is limited to a one-time schedule extension
for the shutdown cooling isolation valve Type C tests.

3. involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

There is a very low probability of a significant increase in valve leakage considering the demonstrated reliability
of the current valve design, the infrequent use of the valves, and the monitoring of the normal operating status of
the RHR system. Moreover, any potential incremental benefit of performing the tests within the two year requirement
would not be sufficient to offset the increased occupational radiation exposure associated with testing, and the
risk to plant safety associated with the removal from service of the primary method of decay heat removal. Consequently,
the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

October 1, 1993 TS 93-09


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise the setpoints and time delays for the auxiliary feedwater (AFW) and 6.9 kv shutdown
board loss of voltage and degraded voltage instrumentation. The proposed changes would affect Technical Specification
(TS) Tables 3.3-3, 3.3-4, 3.3-5, 4.3-2, and the Bases for Specification 3/4.7.1.2. Table 3.3-3 would be revised:
(1) to reflect the use of a two-out-of-three voltage sensor logic for loss of power detection (and one-out-of-two
logic scheme for the timing relays) by adding requirements for the respective AFW, 6.9 kv shutdown board, and emergency
diesel generator (EDG) voltage sensors and load shed timers; (2) by changing the description of the functional unit
from ``Station Blackout'' to ``Loss of Power Start;'' (3) by adding a footnote to indicate that the new requirements
apply only to the shutdown boards on the same unit; (4) by increasing the modes for which the EDG sensors and timers must
be operable to include Modes 5 and 6 when the associated EDG must be operable; (5) by changing the associated Action
statements to reflect the design changes and consistency; (6) to reflect consistent terminology in the Table and
action statements; (7) by changing the minimum number of channels that would be required to be operable; (8) by changing
the footnote to reflect the conditions when the loss-of-power instrumentation is required to be operable in Modes
5 and 6; and (9) by adding an exclusion to Specification 3.0.4. Similar changes were proposed for Tables 3.3-4, 3.3-5
and 4.3-2. The proposed change to Bases 3/4.7.1.2 would clarify AFW operability on loss of power. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: 

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed revision supports the implementation of design logic and setpoint changes to the loss-of-power relaying.
This relaying is designed to ensure adequate voltage is available to safety-related loads in order to enhance their
operability and support accident mitigation functions and to provide for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump starts.
The design changes alter relay logic and delete unnecessary relaying, but do not change the diesel generator (D/G)
start and load-shedding actuations that result from loss-of-power conditions. Therefore, no new actuations or
functions have been created; and because the existing and proposed functions provide for accident mitigation considerations
that are not the source of an accident, the probability of an accident is not increased. The deletion of the 6.9-kilovolt
shutdown board normal-feeder undervoltage relays actually reduces the potential for inadvertent shutdown board
blackouts as a result of short-duration voltage transients or instrument failures.

The setpoints and time delays for loss-of-power functions have been modified based on the guidelines developed by
the Electrical Distribution System Clearinghouse as evaluated and determined through detailed analysis by TVA.
This design is documented in TVA Calculations SQN-EEB-MS-TI06-0008, 27DAT, and DS-1-2 and is available for NRC review
at the SQN site. The assigned values are conservative settings that will ensure adequate voltage is supplied to safety-related
loads for accident mitigation and safety functions under normal, degraded, and loss-of-offsite-power voltage
conditions with appropriate time delays to prevent damage to electrical loads and minimize premature or unnecessary
actuations. The identification of loss-of-voltage conditions is enhanced by the design changes to ensure the timely
sequencing of loads onto the D/G and the initiation of AFW pump starts for accident mitigation. Because there are no
reductions in safety functions resulting from the design logic, setpoint, and time-delay changes to the loss-of-power
instrumentation and offsite dose levels for postulated accidents will not be increased, the consequences of an accident
are not increased. 
The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, and response time measurement clarification incorporated
in the proposed change do not affect plant functions. These changes reflect the requirements that SQN has been maintaining
and serve to clarify the requirements to provide consistency of application and easier understanding. The AFW footnote
addition and bases revision only clarify operability conditions that are consistent with the plant design for the
AFW pump and loss-of-power instrumentation. Because there are no changes to plant functions or operations, these
revisions have no impact on accident probabilities or consequences.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

As described above, the loss-of-power instrumentation ensures adequate voltage to safety-related loads by initiating
D/G starts and load shedding and provides for AFW pump starting, but is not considered to be the source of an accident.
Although the design logic, setpoint, and time-delay actuation criteria have changed, the output functions to various
plant systems that actuate for load shedding and D/G starts remain the same. Therefore, actuation criteria have been
affected, but not safety functions, and the TVA evaluation has confirmed that the new design enhances the ability
to maintain adequate voltage to support safety functions. Since safety functions have not changed and the new loss-of-power
instrumentation design continues to support operability of safety-related equipment, no new or different accident
is created.

The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4 exclusion deletion, and response time measurement clarification, as well
as the AFW operability clarifications, do not affect plant functions and will not create a new accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed loss-of-power TS changes support design logic, setpoint, and time-delay requirements that have been
verified by TVA analysis to provide acceptable voltage levels for safety-related components. In determining the
acceptability of these voltage levels, the minimum voltage for operation as well as detrimental component heating
resulting from sustained degraded-voltage conditions were considered. This design ensures that safety-related
loads will be available and operable for normal and accident plant conditions. The applicable mode addition, TS 3.0.4
exclusion deletion, response time measurement clarification, and AFW operability clarifications provide enhancements
to TS requirements and do not affect plant functions. Therefore, no safety functions are reduced by these changes
and there is no reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are

TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change is a deletion of an administrative reporting requirement that does not in any way affect a previously
analyzed accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created.
The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not affect any accident initiators for SQN. No new failure
modes are introduced.

3.Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Plant safety margins are established through limiting conditions of operation, limiting safety system settings,
and safety limits specified in the TSs. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will be no changes to either the
physical design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits. The proposed changes are administrative and do
not affect the safe operation of SQN. Therefore, there will be no changes to any of the margins of safety.

Control has the responsibility for the radiological environmental program, dose calculations, and projections;
(2) added a requirement in Section 6.5.1.6 for review of the Offsite Dose Calculations Manual (ODCM) by the Plant Operations

Section 6.0, the operating license, index, and definitions. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). The operation of Sequoyah
Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes only affect the administrative controls found in Section 6.0 of the SQN TSs and the operating
license. No plant equipment or operating practices are affected by these changes. The revised administrative controls
will continue to adequately implement administrative activities to support plant nuclear safety. Since there are
no physical changes to the plant, there is no increase in the probability of an accident because these administrative
controls are not the source of previously evaluated accidents. Similarly, with no change to plant equipment or operating
requirements, the plant response to accident conditions and therefore the consequences of an accident remain unchanged.
These proposed changes will not increase the consequences of an accident and offsite dose rates will not be impacted.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 

The administrative controls affected by the proposed changes are not considered to be the source of any accident and
these changes will not alter any plant features or processes. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident and the administrative controls will continue to implement the
actions necessary to support plant activities and nuclear safety.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Plant features and setpoints remain unchanged by the proposed changes to the administrative controls. The margins
of safety established by the SQN design are not affected by these changes. The proposed administrative controls will
continue to maintain the actions and programs that ensure appropriate plant design, operation, and procedures to
support the required margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes will not reduce the margin of safety.

1. The proposed amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The addition of specific general considerations related to equipment surveillance requirements and their relationship
to equipment operability are administrative in nature. They do not change the interpretation or intent of the Technical
Specifications. These conditions are consistent with the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications (STS).

The addition of the specific requirement for the Inservice Test Program to Section 15.4.2 of the Technical Specifications
only reiterates the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g). This requirement does not implement any new requirements on
the operation or testing of equipment. 
The decrease in the number of equipment operational transients due to the increase in the surveillance interval for
the Safety Injection System (SI), Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System, and Containment Spray (CS) System pumps and
valves will result in an increase in system availability. Reduced testing is also expected to have a positive affect
on overall equipment reliability since frequent testing results in increased wear and potential for equipment failure.
Other actions including a monthly verification of system lineups for the SI, CS and RHR systems provides increased
assurance of system operability between surveillance tests. The potential for equipment problems to go undetected
for a longer period of time is small as indicated by equipment surveillance history.

Therefore, these changes will not effect the probability or consequences of previously analyzed accidents.

2. The proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously analyzed.

These changes only affect the equipment testing frequency. Equipment design, operation and the methods of testing
will not be changed. Therefore, the proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
than any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendments will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.


The proposed changes which implement the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g) and clarify the general considerations
related to equipment surveillances are administrative in nature. They do not change the intent of any existing license
or other requirement.

The increase in equipment surveillance intervals will result in an improvement in equipment and system availability
and reliability. Surveillance of equipment will be performed as required by the regulations and Section XI of the
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. These proposed changes will reduce the potential for equipment failures due
to unnecessary testing.

Adequate assurance is provided by testing in accordance with the ASME Code requirements and periodic verification
of system lineups to ensure that the affected systems remain operable and capable of performing their design function.
Therefore, a reduction in a margin of safety will not occur.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin





Date of amendment request: 

December 1, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by incorporating
technical and administrative changes to TS 3.10, Control Rod and Power Distribution Limits. The proposed changes
eliminate specifications for fuel designs no longer used at Kewaunee, specify required actions to be taken upon exceeding
control bank insertion limits, and revise the limits for Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) related parameters
to assure operation within the assumptions of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) analyses.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



(a) TS 3.10.b.1, 3.10.b.4 and Table TS 3.10-2

The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes eliminate the specifications for fuel that is no longer used at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant.
Eliminating these specifications does not affect the probability of any accident previously evaluated.

The specifications for the current fuel vendor are being retained and ensure the consequences of previously evaluated
Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) related accidents are enveloped by the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR)
analyses. Therefore, these changes will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the
USAR.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change deletes specifications for fuel that is no longer used at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant. The
limits for the current fuel vendor are retained and are not affected by this proposed change. This does not alter the
input or assumptions of the safety analysis, and therefore it will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.

(b) TS 3.10.d
 
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change specifies the required actions to be taken when the control bank insertion limits are exceeded.
The current TS requires compliance with the control bank insertion limits, but gives no corrective action for when
these limits are exceeded. The new specification requires operators to initiate boration to restore shutdown margin
within one hour of exceeding the control bank insertion limits and to restore the control banks to within the limits
within 2 hours. If either of these requirements cannot be achieved, within 1 hour the operators must initiate actions
to achieve Hot Standby within the next 6 hours and Hot Shutdown within the following 6 hours. Adding these requirements
clarifies and enhances the Technical Specifications and will have no impact on the probability of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed addition is conservative and ensures that proper and adequate measures are taken when the control bank
exceeds the control bank insertion limits. Therefore, this addition will not increase the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated in the USAR.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change is conservative and clarifies the necessary actions to be taken when control bank insertion limits
are exceeded. This proposed change is an enhancement to the specification and does not reduce the margin of safety.

(c) TS 3.10.k

The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change decreases the maximum RCS inlet temperature limit for steady state 100% operation from 536.5
degrees Fahrenheit to 535.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The value of 539.5 degrees Fahrenheit is the assumed RCS inlet temperature
for the DNB related accidents analyzed in the USAR. These accidents are the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly
Withdrawal at Power Accident, the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal from a Subcritical Condition
Accident, the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Misalignment, the Start-Up of an Inactive Reactor Coolant Loop Accident,
the Excessive Heat Removal due to Feedwater System Malfunction Accident, the Excessive Load Increase Incident,
the Loss of Reactor Coolant Flow Accident, the Loss of External Electrical Load, the Steam Line Break, and the Rod Cluster
Control Assembly Ejection. A four degree assumed instrument error reduces the maximum allowed RCS inlet temperature
to 535.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Decreasing this value to ensure consistency with the USAR analysis assumptions will
have no impact on the probability of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change is conservative to ensure that the consequences of a previously evaluated DNB-related accident
are enveloped by the USAR analysis. Therefore, this change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated in the USAR.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change is conservative and is consistent with the assumptions in the USAR. This proposed change is an
enhancement to the specification and does not reduce the margin of safety.

(d) TS 3.10.l

The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change increased the minimum RCS pressure limit for steady-state 100% power operation from the currently
specified 2200 psig to 2205 psig. The value of 2205 psig (30 psig below the nominal design value of 2235 psig) was the
assumed initial condition for the DNB related accidents analyzed in the USAR. These accidents are the Uncontrolled
Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal at Power Accident, the Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal
from a Subcritical Condition Accident, the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Misalignment, the Start-Up of an Inactive
Reactor Coolant Loop Accident, the Excessive Heat Removal due to Feedwater System Malfunction Accident, the Excessive
Load Increase Incident, the Loss of Reactor Coolant Flow Accident, the Loss of External Electrical Load, the Steam
Line Break, and the Rod Cluster Control Assembly Ejection. Increasing this value to ensure consistency with the USAR
analysis assumptions will have no impact on the probability of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change is conservative to ensure that the consequences of a previously evaluated DNB-related accident
is enveloped by the USAR analysis. Therefore, this change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated in the USAR.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change is conservative and is consistent with the assumptions in the USAR. This proposed change is an
enhancement to the specification and does not reduce the margin of safety.

(e) TS 3.10.m

The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:

1)Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

TS 3.10.m.1 provides the limits and required actions to be taken when the RCS flow rate per loop is less than the USAR
analysis assumptions. Decreasing the flow limit to be consistent with the USAR assumptions will have no impact on
the probability of an accident previously evaluated. Compliance with the flow limit assumed in the USAR analyses
ensures the consequences of previously evaluated DNB-related accidents are enveloped by the USAR analyses. Therefore,
this change will not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR.

The proposed revision places an additional restriction on RCS flow when less than the design flow rate of 89,000 gallons
per minute per loop. The intent of specifying action in accordance with 3.10.n is to ensure that reactor power is reduced
to a point at which the DNB ratio margin is restored. Compliance with this specification will not increase the probability
of an accident previously evaluated, nor increase the consequences of an accident.

The intent of TS 3.10.m.2 is to clarify the conditions under which the reactor coolant flow rate is verified. The conditions,
methodology, and uncertainties associated with this verification are not changed by this specification. Clarifying
the TS by inclusion of the conditions for verifying the flow rate will not increase the probability or consequences
of any accident previously evaluated.
 
2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidents previously evaluated.

A new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated will not be created by this TS change. The proposed
amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance. 

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

A specification on steady-state RCS flow rate is necessary to ensure DNB ratio criteria will be met during the DNBR
limiting events analyzed in the USAR. Reducing the reactor coolant flow limit to the value assumed in the USAR analyses
does not result in a reduction in the margin of safety. 
The additional restrictions being imposed if the specified limit is not met provide additional assurance the DNBR
margin will be restored. These additional restrictions do not exist in the current TS. The imposition of these restrictions
results in an enhancement to the margin of safety.

Clarifying the TS by inclusion of conditions under which the flow verification is to be performed will not reduce the
margin of safety. Existing approved constraints, methodology, and uncertainties are not being changed by this clarification.


(f) TS 3.10.n 

The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:
 
1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The intent of this new TS is to outline the actions required when the limits of TS 3.10.k (RCS temperature), TS 3.10.l
(RCS pressure) and TS 3.10.m.1 (RCS flow) are exceeded. Collectively, these three specifications place limits on
the DNB-related parameters to assure each is maintained within the normal steady-state envelope assumed in the USAR
safety analysis. This specification is an enhancement to our existing specification to add clear guidance which
does not presently exist. Providing this information for the plant staff and operators will not increase the probability
of an accident previously evaluated.

The addition of this action statement will ensure that the consequences of an analyzed accident are not increased.
The proposed specification allows 2 hours to evaluate and restore parameters to within limits. If this time frame
is not satisfied, then within the next 6 hours, power is reduced in order to restore a margin of safety. Following analysis,
thermal power may be raised not to exceed a level analyzed to maintain a minimum DNBR of 1.30.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Addition of the specification is an enhancement to the current specification which does not alter input to the safety
analysis. Therefore, it will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.

(g) Administrative changes to Section TS 3.10 including Figure TS 3.10-2.

The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed changes will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or 
2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent or interpretation of the TS. Therefore,
no significant hazards exist.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request: 

December 7, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 5.3.a.1 to
provide flexibility in the repair of fuel assemblies containing damaged and leaking fuel rods by reconstituting
the assemblies, provided that an NRC-approved methodology is used. This proposed change is consistent with guidance
provided in Supplement 1 to Generic Letter (GL) 90-02, ``Alternative Requirements for Fuel Assemblies in the Design
Features Section of Technical Specifications,'' dated July 21, 1992. In addition, administrative changes to KNPP
TS Section 5 have been proposed. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



The proposed changes were revised in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed changes will not:

1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

This proposed change to the requirements for ``Fuel Assemblies'' in the ``Design Features'' section of the KNPP TS
will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
This proposed change will not result in modifications to fuel assemblies that would have a significant effect on safety
because of the requirement to implement these changes using an NRC-approved methodology. This requirement will
confirm conformance to existing design limits and confirm that safety analyses criteria are met before operation
during the next fuel cycle. This license amendment request is consistent with guidance provided by the NRC and will
result in flexibility for improved fuel performance.

2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The creation of new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated accident is not considered a possibility
because the changes are administrative in nature and do not represent an actual modification to the plant or change
its safety analyses.

3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The margin of safety is maintained by adherence to other fuel related TS limits and the USAR design bases. The changes
do not directly affect any safety system or the safety limits, and thus does not affect the plant margin of safety.

Accordingly, these proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

(3) The auxiliary feedwater system undervoltage automatic start test frequency (specified in TS Table 4.1-1) was
changed to accommodate operation on a 24-month cycle.
(4) The auxiliary feedwater system main feedwater pump trip automatic start test frequency (specified in TS Table
4.1-1) was changed to accommodate operation on a 24-month cycle.
In addition, quarterly testing and 24-month calibration requirements were added to TS Table 4.1-1 for the main steam
line flow instrumentation. These surveillances were added to ensure operability of the main steam line flow circuits
and to be consistent with the TSs surveillance requirements for other engineered safety features instruments.
These changes followed the guidance provided in Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in Technical Specification Surveillance
Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.''

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)



During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By March
4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Management Oversight of Service Contracting



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

OFPP is requesting comments on proposed changes to OFPP Policy Letter 93-1, ``Management Oversight of Service
Contracting'' which are set forth in Supplement No. 1 to the Policy Letter.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OFPP Policy Letter 93-1, ``Management Oversight of Service Contracting,'' was signed by the former OFPP Administrator
on November 19, 1993 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63593).



The Policy Letter is now being revised with a goal of establishing a more ``results-oriented'' approach to providing
agencies with best practices to use in managing and administering service contracts. The initial guidance neither
prescribes specific improvements that agencies can make in this area nor ways that results can be measured. During
this Administration, OFPP's activities will focus on two major objectives: streamlining the procurement process
and achieving excellence in contractor performance. We believe that one way to improve contractor performance is
to improve contract management and administration. In this regard, we plan to work with the agencies and industry
to develop practices that represent best value in contract management and administration. This approach is in keeping
with the National Performance Review principle of providing guiding principles rather than rigid rules. Hence,
we are revising the Policy Letter, in particular sections 8a and 8b, to reflect this new approach. Agencies are encouraged
to begin developing implementation strategies and initiating staff training to ensure effective implementation
of the provisions of this revised Policy Letter until the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is changed.

Since the December 2, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice which also included the rescission of OMB Circular No. A-120, some agencies have raised concerns that
the rescission of the Circular was effective immediately but the Policy Letter was not effective until 30 days after
publication in the 

Federal Register

. (OFPP has a statutory requirement to allow 30 days before any procurement policy can become effective.) We understand
the concern, but it was our intent to make the rescission of Circular A-120 effective immediately, although
we realize that it takes time to have the FAR guidance changed. In the interim, agencies are encouraged to review their
internal procedures for managing and controlling the use of advisory and assistance services and determine what
changes may be needed to ensure compliance with this revised Policy Letter. Some agencies may elect to use their existing
management control procedures for all services covered by the Policy Letter until the FAR guidance is in place.

We are issuing the following changes to the Policy Letter which are included in the attached Supplement No. 1:

1. The second sentence under section 4 (Definition) is being revised to clarify that only nonpersonal services obtained
under contract from the private sector (i.e., business firms, educational institutions, non-profits, and state
and local governments) are covered. Services obtained through the use of interagency agreements are not covered
by this Policy Letter.

2. The second paragraph under section 5 (Exclusions) is revised to delete reference to the management oversight responsibilities
which will be consistent with the revised paragraphs 8a. and 8b.

3. The second introductory paragraph under section 7 (Good Management Practices) is being revised to delete reference
to the requirement for individual and class reviews, and the reference to the responsible management official. Agencies
must ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting and
use good management practices and contract administration techniques when contracting for services.

4. Paragraphs a. and b. under Section 8 (Responsibilities) are being revised in their entirety to incorporate the
new ``best practices'' approach to managing and administering service contracts. 
5. Paragraph d. under section 8, which pertains to the Inspectors General, is being revised to ensure that any reviews
are simply to ensure that agencies are in compliance with the revised Policy Letter.
The guidance in section 7 which refers to the questions in the appendix A, and any resulting ``best practices'' models
developed by OFPP in contract administration should not be viewed as mandatory regulatory guidance for audit purposes.
We believe that agencies should use the questions as warning signals to prevent problems from occurring and the ``best
practices'' models to help resolve those problems.
All other provisions of the policy Letter remain unchanged.

Policy Letter 93-1, Supplement No. 1

To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Management Oversight of Service Contracting.




The purpose of this supplement to Policy Letter 93-1 is to provide agencies with a more ``results-oriented''
approach to managing and administering service contracts by introducing the ``best practices'' concept. The Policy
Letter was issued on November 19, 1993 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63593).

The following changes are being made to the Policy Letter:

1. Section 4. 

Definition.

 The second sentence is revised to read: For purposes of this Policy Letter, only nonpersonal services obtained under
contract are covered.

2. Section 5. 

Exclusions.

 The second paragraph is revised to read:

Services obtained under contracts below the small purchase threshold, through the use of interagency agreements,
and that are incidental to supply contracts also are excluded from coverage of this Policy Letter. However, agencies
should ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting
and use good management practices and contract administration techniques when using these contracting methods
to obtain services.

3. Section 7. 

Good Management Practices.

 The second introductory paragraph is revised to read:

The following sections offer guidance to ensure that good management practices are being followed. Agencies should
involve procurement and program officials when developing requirements for service contracts. Appendix A contains
a series of questions to help analyze and perfect service contract requirements within these guidelines. If the guidelines
apply, and if the response to any of the questions listed in the Appendix is affirmative, agencies should ensure that
they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting and use good management
practices and contract administration techniques.

4. Section 8. 

Responsibilities.

 Paragraphs a., b., and d. are revised to read:

a. Heads of Agencies. Agency heads (or their designees) should ensure that:

(1) Requirements for services are clearly defined and appropriate performance standards are developed so that contractor
performance meets contract terms and conditions.

(2) Service contracts are awarded and administered in such a manner that will provide the customer its goods and services
on time, and within budget.

(3) Specific procedures are in place when contracting for services to assure compliance with OFPP Policy Letter 92-1,
Inherently Governmental Functions (57 FR 45096 (1992), 91-2, Service Contracting (56 FR 15110 (1991), and
89-1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants, 54 FR 51805 (1989).

(4) Implementation strategies are developed and necessary staff training is initiated to assure effective implementation
of these policies.

b. Contracting Officials. Contracting officials should ensure that ``best practice'' techniques, such as those
set forth below, are used when contracting for services:

(1) The corporate experience section of a contractor's bid proposal should be reviewed to detect conflicts of interest.
Usually, the corporate experience section contains the contractor's prior business clients.

(2) Monthly progress reports should be reviewed to detect whether the contractor may be performing inherently governmental
functions.

Contracting officials should also seek other best practices techniques in contract management and administration
that may be used within their own contracting activities or other agencies that will help to achieve excellence in
contractor performance. OFPP will also be working to develop governmentwide ``best practices'' models in contract
administration which will be issued as separate guidance.

d. Inspectors General. The Inspectors General are encouraged to conduct vulnerability assessments of service contracting
and, where warranted, include in their annual plans a review of service contracts to ensure compliance with the Policy
Letter.

The guidance in section 7 which refers to the questions in appendix A, and any resulting ``best practices'' models
developed by OFPP should not be viewed as mandatory regulatory guidance for audit purposes.

All other provisions of the Policy Letter remain unchanged.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of disaster relief in response to Los Angeles earthquake.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is waiving penalties for certain late payments of premiums, is forgoing
assessment of penalties for failure to comply with certain information submission requirements, and is extending
the deadlines for complying with certain requirements of its administrative review and standard termination regulations.
This relief is generally available to persons residing in, or whose principal place of business is within, an area
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as affected by the major disaster declared by the President
of the United States on account of the severe earthquake in the Los Angeles area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program
under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), 29 U.S.C. 1001 

et seq

. Under ERISA and the PBGC's regulations, a number of deadlines must be met in order to avoid the imposition of penalties
or other consequences. Four areas in which the PBGC is providing relief are (1) penalties for late payment of premiums
due the PBGC, (2) ERISA section 4071 penalties for failure to provide required notices or other material information
by the applicable time limit, (3) deadlines for filing a standard termination notice and distributing plan assets
in a standard termination, and (4) deadlines for filing requests for reconsideration or appeals of certain agency
determinations.




The President of the United States has declared, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121,
5122(2), 5141(b)), that a major disaster exists because of the severe earthquake that struck the Los Angeles area
on January 17, 1994. At this time, three California counties (Los Angeles, Ventura, and Orange) are designated areas
(within the meaning of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA'') regulations; 44 CFR 205.2(a)(5)).

Given the severity of this major disaster, as the Executive Director of the PBGC, I have decided to provide relief from
certain PBGC deadlines and penalties. For purposes of premium penalties, section 4071 penalties, and standard termination
deadlines, this notice is applicable with respect to plans whose administrators' or sponsors' principal place of
business, or for which the office of a service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining information
necessary to meet the applicable deadlines, is located in a designated disaster area. For purposes of filing requests
for reconsideration or appeals, this notice is applicable to any aggrieved person who is residing in, or whose principal
place of business is within, a designated disaster area, or with respect to whom the office of the service provider,
bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the request for reconsideration
or appeal is within such an area. 


Premiums


The PBGC will waive the late payment penalty charge with respect to any premium payment required to be made on or after
January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, if the payment is made by March 15, 1994. The PBGC is not permitted by law
to waive late payment interest charges. (ERISA section 4007(b); 29 CFR 2610.7 and 2610.8(b)(3).)


Section 4071 Penalties


The PBGC will not assess a section 4071 penalty for a failure to file any of the following notices that were, or will be,
required to be filed with the PBGC on or after January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, if the notice is filed by March
15, 1994:
Standard termination post-distribution certification (PBGC Form 501; ERISA section 4041(b)(3)(B); 29 CFR 2617.28(h)
(57 FR 59206, 59233-34, December 14, 1992);
(2) Notice of termination for multiemployer plans (ERISA section 4041A; 29 CFR 2673.2);
(3) Notice of plan amendments increasing benefits by more than $10 million (ERISA section 307(e)); and
(4) Reportable event notice, except for reportable events related to bankruptcy or insolvency (or similar proceeding
or settlement), liquidation or dissolution, and transactions involving a change in contributing sponsor or controlled
group (ERISA section 4043; 29 CFR 2615.21, 2615.22, and 2615.23).
The PBGC will not assess a section 4071 penalty for a failure to provide certain supporting information and documentation
when any of the following notices is timely filed:
(1) Notice of failure to make required contributions totaling more than $1 million (including interest) (PBGC Form
200; ERISA section 302(f)(4); 29 CFR 2615.30), and
(2) Notice of a reportable event related to bankruptcy or insolvency (or similar proceeding or settlement), liquidation
or dissolution, or a transaction involving a change in contributing sponsor or controlled group. For a notice of failure
to make required contributions, the timely filed notice must include at least items 1 through 7 and items 11 and 12 of
Form 200; the responses to items 8 through 10, with the certifications in items 11 and 12, may be filed late. For a reportable
event notice, the timely filed notice must include at least the information specified in 29 CFR 2615.3(b) (1) through
(5); the information that may be filed late is that specified in 29 CFR 2615.3(b) (6) through (9) and 2615.3(c) (5) and
(6), as applicable. This relief applies to notices that were, or will be, required to be filed with the PBGC on or after
January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, provided that all supporting information and documentation are filed
by March 15, 1994.


Standard Termination Notice and Distribution of Assets


With respect to a standard termination for which the standard termination notice is required to be filed, or the distribution
of plan assets is required to be completed, on or after January 15, 1994, the PBGC is extending to March 15, 1994, the
time within which the standard termination notice must be filed (and, thus, the time within which notices of plan benefits
must be provided) and the time within which the distribution of plan assets must be completed. In addition, as noted
above, the PBGC is providing relief from penalties for late filing of the post-distribution certification. (On August
24, 1993, the PBGC published an interim rule amending 29 CFR 2617.3, 2617.25, and 2617.28 to provide for extensions
of time under the circumstances addressed in this notice (58 FR 44738; as corrected, 58 FR 48600, September 17, 1993).)

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Clearing Corporation and Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia,
Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes Relating to the Establishment
of Interfaces With the National Securities Clearing Corporation's Fixed Income Transaction System 



January 26, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on August 23, 1993, and October 15, 1993, respectively, the Midwest Clearing Corporation
(``MCC'') and the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been
prepared primarily by MCC and SCCP. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested
persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule changes.





I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes 



MCC and SCCP each propose to establish an interface with National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'')
recently approved Fixed Income Transaction System (``FITS'') which is designed to achieve higher rates of trade
comparison at earlier times in the municipal securities comparison process.
 





II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



In its filing with the Commission, MCC and SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule changes and discussed any comments they received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements may
be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MCC and SCCP have prepared summaries, set forth in section (A),
(B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



Under the proposed rule filings, MCC and SCCP each will implement procedures to establish an interface with NSCC's
FITS to enable MCC and SCCP participants to take advantage of the improved input and comparison features of FITS. It
should be noted that all trade comparison will be conducted at NSCC and not at either MCC or SCCP. 

MCC and SCCP are required by NSCC to submit two-side original trade input information on behalf of their respective
participants to NSCC by 2 a.m. on the business day after trade date (``T+1'').
 NSCC will transmit a comparison report to MCC and SCCP reflecting the compared trades of their respective participants
early on the morning of T+1 so that MCC and SCCP can produce contract reports for their own participants.
 MCC's and SCCP's interfaces with NSCC will enable their participants to take full advantage of the features and benefits
offered by FITS.
 







B. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition 



MCC and SCCP do not believe a burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule changes. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No comments were received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action



Section 17A(a)(2)(A) of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 Because the interfaces enable MCC and SCCP participants to utilize FITS with all its benefits, the Commission believes,
for all the reasons set forth in the FITS approval order,
 that the proposed rule changes filed by MCC and SCCP further this goal.






MCC and SCCP have requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the
thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving
the proposed rule change because the Commission has previously published notice of and has approved NSCC's implementation
of the system.
 NSCC's proposed rule change did not generate any comment letters, and none are expected on MCC's and SCCP's proposals.
Furthermore, MCC and SCCP filed the proposed rule changes implementing the interfaces with FITS subsequent to the
interfaces becoming operational.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, and at the principal offices of MCC and SCCP.
All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR-MCC-93-04 and SR-SCCP-93-03 and
should be submitted by February 23, 1994.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-MCC-93-04 and SR-SCCP-93-03) be,
and hereby are, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Capital and Clearing Fund Requirements for Users of Mutual Fund Services</DOCTITLE>



January 26, 1994.



On August 20, 1993, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No.
SR-NSCC-93-11) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section
19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 On August 23, 1993, NSCC filed an amendment to the proposed rule change. Notice of the proposal was published in the


Federal Register

 on November 12, 1993, to solicit comments from interested persons.
 Two comment letters were received; both of which were in support of the proposed rule change.
 As discussed below, this order approves the proposal.







I. Description



NSCC has revised its capital standards for broker-dealers and banks that desire to join NSCC to use only NSCC'S mutual
fund services
 and for entities that desire to join NSCC to become Funds Members.
 NSCC also has revised its clearing fund requirements for members that limit their use of NSCC services to only NSCC's
mutual fund services. The revisions are to better reflect the risks and nature of NSCC's mutual fund services, which
are not guaranteed by NSCC.






Broker-dealer applicants for NSCC membership that wish to restrict their NSCC activities to the mutual fund services
will be required to have $25,000 in excess net capital over the minimum net capital requirement imposed by the Commission
or their designated examining authority, whichever is greater. Bank or trust company applicants will be required
to have $100,000 in excess capital over the capital requirement imposed by their state or federal regulatory authority.
 Members who are accepted under these proposed alternative standards will be required, depending on their level of
settlement debits with NSCC, to make deposits to the clearing funds for their mutual fund services activities of $10,000,
$20,000, or $40,000 instead of the current $5,000, $10,000, or $20,000, respectively.







Broker-dealer applicants for Fund Member status that distribute shares for investment companies with aggregate
assets under management of $500,000 or more will be required to have $25,000 in excess net capital over the minimum
net capital requirement imposed by the Commission or their designated examining authority, whichever is greater.
Applicants that distribute shares for investment companies with aggregate assets under management of less than
$500,000 will be required to have excess net capital of $50,000 over the minimum net capital requirements imposed
by the Commission or their designated examining authority, whichever is greater. Investment company applicants
will be permitted to become Fund Members provided that they have a minimum of $100,000 in assets under management.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act.
 Specifically, Section 17A(b)(3)(B) requires a clearing agency's rules to provide for the participation of registered
broker-dealers, registered clearing agencies, registered investment companies, and banks deemed appropriate
to the development of a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 NSCC's rule change expands the number of members eligible to clear and settle their mutual fund transactions through
NSCC's facilities. Access to NSCC's mutual fund services is increasingly important to all entities in the mutual
fund industry. Lower net capital requirements will enable smaller mutual funds, broker-dealers, banks, and trust
companies to participate in NSCC's mutual fund services. Smaller entities thus achieve a parity with their larger
competitors in terms of access to orderly, automated transaction processing systems, which are now the industry
standard. A common automated means of communication among those entities involved in mutual fund transactions serves
the public interest by eliminating the existence of inefficient, error-prone manual data interchanges.






The Commission also believes that NSCC's rule change satisfies the requirements of Sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and (F)
that a clearing agency be organized and that its rules be designed to safeguard securities and funds in its custody
or control or for which it is responsible.
 Because NSCC does not guarantee the completion of mutual fund transactions under its mutual fund services program,
the Commission does not believe that any additional risk to NSCC will result from the lower net capital requirements
for those members that use only the mutual fund services of NSCC and does not believe that NSCC's ability to safeguard
securities or funds will be impaired. Along with lower net capital requirements, NSCC is imposing increased clearing
fund requirements for members who participate in NSCC's mutual fund services program under the alternative net capital
requirements approved in this order. The Commission believes that the increased clearing funds requirements will
help protect NSCC and its participants from the risk of default by members using NSCC's mutual fund services.





III. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that NSCC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act.








It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-93-11) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Bond Listing Standards</DOCTITLE>


January 27, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 22, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change would enable the Exchange to simplify and relax its standards for the listing and delisting
of debt securities.
The complete text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The Exchange is proposing to revise its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities. In particular,
the Exchange seeks to clarify and simplify its debt security listing standards.
The Exchange hopes to make an Exchange listing more accessible for issuers of debt securities and to facilitate the
listing of debt securities. The Exchange's goal in both cases is to augment the number of listed debt securities. The
Exchange believes that this will serve the public interest because it will subject a greater number of debt securities
to the Exchange's trading and disclosure systems.
In order to accomplish these goals, the Exchange proposes to rely upon the Exchange's equity listing and maintenance
standards in determining whether issues can adequately demonstrate that they can meet interest obligations on debt
securities. That is, where an issuer has common stock listed on the Exchange and is in good standing, the Exchange would
normally list the issuer's debt security issues of $5 million or more. Because the debt security enjoys seniority
over the equity issue, the ``good standing'' test warrants listing the debt security.
Where the issuer of a debt security does not list its common stock on the Exchange, the Exchange proposes to rely upon
the analyses of nationality recognized securities rating organizations (``NRSRO'') for the interest-coverage
determination.
For those purposes, the Exchange proposes to make the following changes to Paragraphs 102.03, 103.05, 703.06, 801.00
and 802.00 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual:

Under Paragraph 102.03:

 As at present, the Exchange would require the issue to have a market value or principal amount of $5 million.

 The Exchange would no longer require the issuer to demonstrate on a pro forma basis interest coverage on all
debt securities.





 The Exchange would no longer evaluate the anticipated distribution of a debt security. (The proposed rule
change proposes a conforming change to Paragraph 703.06 to remove a mention of the distribution requirement.)
 The Exchange would not longer require convertible debt securities to be convertible only into common stock
listed on the Exchange, although the Exchange would require that equity securities underlying convertible securities
be subject to a real-time last sale reporting obligation.
 I the case of debt securities proposed to be listed by ``unaffiliated'' issuers:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-2-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-2-00060 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An NRSRO must have assigned a current rating to the issue that is no lower than the ratings in the S&P Corporation
``B'' category (

i.e.

, ``B-'' or better) or another NRSRO's counterpart to the S&P Corporation rating.

Alternatively, if no NRSRO has assigned a rating to the issue, an NRSRO must have currently assigned either an investment
grade rating (

i.e.

, an S&P Corporation rating no lower that 
``BBB-'' or another NRSRO's counterpart to the S&P Corporation rating) to a senior issue or, in the case of a 

pari passu

 
 or junior issue (including a preferred stock or debt security issue), a rating no lower than the ratings in the S&P
Corporation ``B'' category (

i.e.

,
 ``B-'' or better) or another NRSRO's counterpart to the S&P Corporation rating.





In the case of a listing for an unrated issue that is junior to an issue with an investment grade rating, the Exchange
notes that a junior issue would generally be rated no more than one rating category below an immediate senior issue.
Thus, the Exchange feels that such an unrated debt issue seeking to list would, if it were rated, receive a rating that
satisfies the minimum ``B-'' rating standard. All other unrated debt issues of unaffiliated issuers must either
be senior to or 

pari passu

 with an issue rated at least ``B-'' in order to qualify for listing on the Exchange.
An ``unaffiliated'' issuer is one that has no equity securities listed on the Exchange; is not, directly or indirectly,
majority-owned by, nor under common control with, an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities; and is not issuing
a debt security that an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities is guaranteeing.
Paragraph 103.05 makes the same changes to the listing standards for the debt securities of non-U.S. companies as
Paragraph 102.03 makes in respect of the standards for domestic debt securities.
Under Paragraph 810.00, the Exchange proposes to review the continued listing of a debt security convertible into
an equity security when the equity security is delisted. In addition, the Exchange proposes to delist a debt security
when the underlying equity security ceases to be subject to real-time trade reporting.
Under Paragraph 802.00, the Exchange would no longer view inadequate interest coverage of an issuer or its parent
or a subsidiary as reason for delisting a security.





In the case of a sovereign issue, the Exchange will evaluate whether to list the issue for trading on a case-by-case
basis. The Exchange's current policy in respect of municipal securities is to list initially only term/dollar bonds.





The Exchange believes that it should extend to a broader universe of debt securities the benefits that derive from
the Exchange's unique bond market and price disclosure mechanism, especially for individual bond holders and small
to mid-sized institutions. The debt security listing standard modifications that the proposed rule change proposes
would effect such an extension to the betterment of the community of investors and debt securities.


2. Statutory Basis


The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have
rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on the proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Station, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available

 Notice Dismissing Application and Closing the Docket. 




APPLICANT: 

National Solid Wastes Management Association, on behalf of its Chemical Waste Transportation Institute. 



LOCAL LAW AFFECTED:

 Ordinance No. 305 of the City of Chester, West Virginia, Regarding Transportation of Hazardous Wastes. 



APPLICABLE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS: 

Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 App. U.S.C.  1801 et seq., and the Hazardous Materials Regulations,
49 CFR Parts 171-180. 



MODE AFFECTED:

 Highway 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The application for a determination of preemption is dismissed, and this docket is closed, because Ordinance No.
305 of Chester, West Virginia never went into effect. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
In December 1991, the National Solid Wastes Management Association, on behalf of its Chemical Waste Transportation
Institute (CWTI), petitioned for an administrative determination that the HMTA preempts Chester, West Virginia
Ordinance No. 305, regarding the transportation of hazardous wastes. In its application, CWTI stated that the Chester
City Council had ``enacted Ordinance No. 305,'' and the copy of Ordinance No. 305 attached to CWTI's application indicated
that the Ordinance had been ``Passed and Adopted'' on December 2, 1991. 


On April 6, 1992, FHWA and RSPA published a Public Notice and Invitation to Comment on CWTI's application. 57 FR 11654.
That Notice was issued jointly by both agencies because the requirements in Ordinance No. 305 purported to affect
both the highway routing of hazardous materials and other aspects of hazardous materials transportation. See 57
FR at 11655. In response to that Notice, four industry associations and more than 20 individual companies submitted
comments opposing Ordinance No. 305 and supporting a finding of preemption. One party submitting comments, the Tri-State
Area Transporters Association, stated that Ordinance No. 305 was originally scheduled to become effective February
1, 1992, but that in January 1992, ``Chester apparently revised the ordinance, with no effective date given.'' 
No party, including the City of Chester, submitted comments opposing CWTI's application. CWTI submitted further
comments, which it called ``rebuttal.'' 
In a recent telephone conversation, Chester Mayor Ken Morris advised RSPA that Ordinance No. 305 was never adopted
and never went into effect. Copies of a December 6, 1993 letter to Mayor Morris, confirming the substance of this telephone
conversation, were sent to CWTI and each party submitting comments on CWTI's application. In a December 17, 1993 letter,
CWTI advised that, based on information from its members, Ordinance No. 305 has never been enforced and that CWTI had
``no objection to DOT dismissing the Institute's petition at this time * * * without prejudice * * *
'' 
CWTI's application is hereby dismissed, and the docket is closed. If the requirements contained in Chester, West
Virginia Ordinance No. 305 are ever adopted and enforced, CWTI may again submit an application for a preemption determination.

on yard tracks 289 and 290, from milepost 288.8 to CP B288 at milepost 287.2, in the North Platte Terminal, North Platte,
Nebraska. 

The reason given for the proposed changes is that due to operational changes, tracks 289 and 290 are no longer used to
bypass the classification yard. Tracks 289 and 290 have been incorporated into a nine track westbound coal yard used
for the staging and inspection of empty coal trains, making the signals and coded cab track circuits unnecessary.

AC Cars Ltd; Receipt of Petition for Temporary Exemption From Standard No. 208



AC Cars Ltd. of Weybridge, Surrey, England, has petitioned for a temporary exemption until November 1, 1996, for its
Ace model, from the automatic protection requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, 

Occupant Crash Protection. 

The basis of the petition is that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship.

Notice of receipt of the petition is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject (49 CFR part 555)
and does not represent any judgment of the agency on the merits of the petition.



Petitioner's Hardship Arguments



Under 15 U.S.C. 1410(a)(1)(A), the Administrator may provide a temporary exemption upon a finding that ``compliance
would cause substantial economic hardship and that the manufacturer has, in good faith, attempted to comply * * *.''

The following is a summary of AC's petition. The company is privately owned and produced no motor vehicles during the
12 months preceding the filing of its petition. The first prototype of the Ace was shown in 1986. Since then, the company
has spent much time redesigning it ``to meet the increasingly higher standards of emissions and safety * * *
with the original intentions of achieving first sales into North America.'' To date, the petitioner has spent approximately
5,000,000 Pounds Sterling on the project, 100,000 of which (and 1,250 man hours) have been spent in the past two years
in research and development relating to meeting the automatic restraint requirements of Standard No. 208. Because
the Ace is a full convertible, the company found that it could not adopt an automatic seat belt system. Additional design
changes, development and actual testing are necessary in order to install in the Ace an airbag system that meets Standard
No. 208. Being a small manufacturer of motor vehicles, the petitioner has had to rely on the expertise of outside parties
in the design and development of necessary components.

AC has concluded that modifications of the following will be required to accommodate driver and passenger side airbag
systems: Interior dash and cockpit components, seats, steering wheel and chassis. The estimted cost of these modifications
is 750,000 Pounds Sterling, exclusive of testing costs. The company's balance sheet shows that its cumulative losses,
which were approximately 1,500,000 Pounds Sterling as of December 31, 1989, has increased to approximately 4,275,000
Pounds Sterling as of September 30, 1993.

The company anticipates that it will be able to conform by November 1, 1996. It projects total sales of 200 units in 1994
and 350 in 1995, half of which are proposed for North American sales.



Arguments Why an Exemption Would be in the Public Interest and Consistent With Traffic Safety Objectives



In order to grant an exemption, the Administrator must also find that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent
with the objectives of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. In support of its petition, AC has informed
NHTSA that the Ace will be equipped with a three-point restraint system that conforms to Standard No. 208, ``the mountings
of which have been tested in accordance with and achieved FMV210 (sic) US standard approval.'' Further, except for
the automatic restraint requirements, the Ace has been designed to meet all other Federal motor vehicle safety standards,
and the bumper standard. It will be manufactured ``using the following US sourced components: Ford engine, transmission,
exhaust, wiring and associated components.'' According to the petitioner, ``US parts sourcing and dealer network
labor involvement is also in the best interest of the US economy.''

Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the Docket
number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh
St. SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated below will be considered,
and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent
possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action on the petition will
be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.
 
Comment closing date: March 4, 1994.

AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1986 Bentley Turbo passenger cars are eligible for importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1986 Bentley Turbo passenger cars not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation to the United States
because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified version
of the 1986 Bentley Turbo), and they are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determined in the 

Federal Register

.
G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer R-90-007) petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1986 Bentley Turbo passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
NHTSA published notice of the petition on October 26, 1993 (58 FR 57670) to afford an opportunity for public comment.
The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response
to the notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the
petition.


Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles


The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final determination must indicate on the form HS-7 accompanying
entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 

#

53 is the vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this determination.


Final Determination


Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1986 Bentley Turbo not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially similar to a 1986 Bentley Turbo
originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified under section 114 of the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice informs the public of certain import statistics for the period from January through October 1993 and affords
the public an opportunity to comment on certain discretionary decisions the President may make with respect to the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. These decisions concern: (1) The GSP ``competitive need'' limits
set forth in section 504(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)); (2) the ``de
minimis waiver'' authority set forth in section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act; and (3) the redesignation authority set
forth in section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act. Presidential decisions concerning the application of competitive need
limits and other product-related decisions stemming from the 1993 Annual Review are expected to be announced in April,
and implemented on July 1, 1994. This notice also announces the successful disposition of the review of worker rights
practices in Costa Rica and Paraguay in the 1993 Annual GSP Review.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Competitive Need Limits


Pursuant to section 504(c), any GSP-eligible beneficiary country that exported to the United States during the most
recent calendar year a quantity of any one GSP eligible article in excess of (1) $25 million indexed to the nominal growth
of U.S. Gross National Product (GNP) since 1974, or (2) 50 percent of the value of total U.S. imports of the article,
is to be removed from GSP eligibility with respect to that article not later than July 1 of the next calendar year. The
preliminary estimate of this dollar limit, subject to revision, is $107,320,423 for calendar year 1993.


II. Reduced Competitive Need Limits


Pursuant to section 504(c)(2) of the 1974 Act, a general review of the GSP was initiated in 1985 and the results of the
review were announced on January 2, 1987 (52 FR 389). The purpose of the general review was to determine whether beneficiary
countries had become sufficiently competitive in GSP-eligible products, on a product and country specific basis.
For beneficiaries found to be sufficiently competitive with respect to a product, the percentage competitive need
limit was reduced to 25 percent and the dollar limit was reduced to $25 million, indexed to the nominal growth of U.S.
GNP since 1984. The preliminary estimate of this dollar limit, subject to revision, is $41,621,070 for calendar year
1993.


III. Discretionary Decisions


A. De Minimis Waivers


Section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act permits the President to disregard the 50 percent ``competitive need'' limit with
respect to any eligible article if the value of total imports of the article during the most recent calendar year did
not exceed $5 million, indexed to the nominal growth of U.S. GNP since 1979. The preliminary estimate of the 

de minimis

 level, subject to revision, is $12,553,356 for calendar year 1993.


B. Redesignation of Eligible Articles


If a country is no longer a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article because imports exceeded
the competitive need limits in a prior year, then, pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act, the President may
redesignate the beneficiary developing country with respect to the eligible article if imports do not exceed the
competitive need limits in a subsequent year.

A proclamation will be issued to be effective July 1, 1994, making the adjustments to the list of eligible articles
that are required by section 504(c) of the 1974 Act and announcing the discretionary decisions referred to in this
notice, on the basis of official data covering all of calendar year 1993.

It should be emphasized that the information set forth below covers only the first 10 months of 1993. Partial year data
is being published now to provide the maximum possible advance indication of adjustments that may be made to meet the
requirements of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act and to afford the earliest opportunity for comment on the possible discretionary
decisions.

List I below shows specific GSP-eligible articles for beneficiaries which have already exceeded estimated competitive
need limitations (i.e., a beneficiary supplied over $107,320,423 or $41,621,070 in the case where a beneficiary
has been found sufficiently competitive in the product, during January-October 1993) or have been graduated
from the GSP in early years pursuant to the President's discretionary authority.

List II below shows beneficiaries which are approaching the competitive need limitations (i.e., a beneficiary accounted
for over 42 percent of the value of total U.S. imports and/or over $85,856,338 million or in the case where a beneficiary
has been found sufficiently competitive, over 21 percent and/or $33,296,856 million during January-October
1993).

List III below shows beneficiaries which, despite accounting for more than 50 percent (or 25 percent in the case of
a beneficiary found sufficiently competitive in a product) of the value of total U.S. imports of an article, may be
eligible to receive GSP benefits through the 

de minimis

 waiver (i.e., where a beneficiary accounted for more than the applicable percentage limit but the value of total U.S.
imports of the item was less that $12,553,356 during January-October 1993).

List IV below shows articles from beneficiaries which are currently ineligible for GSP duty-free treatment but which
may be eligible for redesignation to GSP status pursuant to the President's discretionary authority (i.e., a beneficiary
accounted for less than 50 percent, or 25 percent in the case of products for which it was found sufficiently competitive,
of the value of U.S. imports and the value of U.S. imports of the article from the beneficiary developing country was
less than the applicable dollar limit during January-October 1993). This list does not include articles from
India which do not receive GSP treatment as a result of Presidential Proclamation 6425 of April 29, 1992 (57 FR 19067),
6446 of June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26969) or 6447 of June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26981).



V. Public Comments



All written comments with regard to the decisions summarized above should be addressed to: GSP Subcommittee, Office
of the U.S. Trade Representative, 600 17th Street NW., room 517, Washington, DC 20506. All submissions must be in English
and should conform to the information requirements of 15 CFR 2007. Furthermore, each party providing comments should
indicate on the first page of the submission its name, the relevant Harmonized Tariff Schedule subheading(s), the
beneficiary country or territory of interest, and the type of action (i.e., the use of the President's 

de minimis

 waiver authority, etc.) in which the party is interested.

A party must provide fourteen copies of its statement which must be received by the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee
no later than 5 p.m., Wednesday, March 2. Comments received after the deadline will not be accepted. If the comments
contain business confidential information, fourteen copies of a non-confidential version must also be submitted.
A justification as to why the information contained in the submission should be treated confidentially must be included
in the submission. In addition, the submissions containing confidential information should be clearly marked ``confidential''
at the top and bottom of each page of the submission. The version that does not contain confidential information should
also be clearly marked, at the top and bottom of each page, ``public version'' or ``non-confidential''.

Written comments submitted in connection with these decisions, except for information granted ``business confidential''
status pursuant to 15 CFR 2007.7, will be available for public inspection shortly after the filing deadline by appointment
only with the staff of the USTR Public Reading Room. Other requests and questions should be directed to the GSP Information
Center at USTR by calling (202) 395-6971.



VI. Disposition of the Review of Worker Rights Practices in Costa Rica and Paraguay in the 1993 Annual GSP Review



In June 1993, petitions were filed with the Office of the United States Trade Representative that requested a review
of worker rights practices in Costa Rica and in Paraguay in the 1993 Annual GSP Review. In October 1993, the petitions
were accepted and a review was initiated to determine whether Costa Rica and Paraguay were complying with the worker
rights provision of section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2462), which requires beneficiary countries to
have taken and be taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights (58 FR 53959). At the time that the
petitions were accepted for review, United States Trade Representative Kantor noted that, because actions to improve
worker rights in Costa Rica and Paraguay were in process, the GSP reviews could be terminated at any time during the
review period. In December 1993, Costa Rica and Paraguay were found to be taking steps to afford internationally recognized
worker rights, as provided in section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, because substantial positive actions had been taken
by the Government of Costa Rica and the Government of Paraguay to resolve the allegations and shortcomings listed
in the petitions. Accordingly, the GSP reviews were terminated.

Executive Summary 



This document updates and replaces the previously published CDC Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia
(Infection Control 1982;3:327-33, Resp Care 1983;28:221-32, and Am J Infect Control 1983;11230-9).
The revised guideline is designed to reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and provides the rationale (in
Part I) for the recommendations (in Part II) considered prudent by consensus of the members of HICPAC. A working draft
of the guideline has been reviewed by experts in infection control, pulmonology, respiratory therapy, anesthesiology,
internal medicine, and pediatrics. However, all recommendations in the guideline may not reflect the opinions of
all reviewers. 

Pneumonia is the second most common nosocomial infection in the United States and is associated with substantial
morbidity and mortality. Most patients with nosocomial pneumonia are those with extremes of age, severe underlying
disease, immunosuppression, depressed sensorium, cardiopulmonary disease, and thoraco-abdominal surgery.
Although patients with mechanically assisted ventilation do not comprise a major proportion of patients with nosocomial
pneumonia, they have the highest risk of developing the infection. 

Most bacterial nosocomial pneumonias occur by aspiration of bacteria colonizing the oropharynx or upper gastrointestinal
tract of the patient. Intubation and mechanical ventilation greatly increase the risk of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia
because they alter first-line patient defenses. Pneumonias due to 

Legionella

 spp., 

Aspergillus

 spp., and influenza virus are often caused by inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) infection usually follows viral inoculation of the conjunctivae or nasal mucosa by contaminated hands. 

Traditional preventive measures for nosocomial pneumonia include decreasing aspiration by the patient, preventing
cross-contamination or colonization via hands of personnel, appropriate disinfection or sterilization of respiratory-therapy
devices, use of available vaccines to protect against particular infections, and education of hospital staff and
patients. New measures under investigation involve reducing oropharyngeal and gastric colonization by pathogenic
microorganisms. 



Introduction



The Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia is intended for use by personnel who are responsible for surveillance
and control of infections in acute-care hospitals. The guideline may not be applicable in long-term care facilities
because of the unique characteristics of these settings.

The revised guideline addresses common problems encountered by infection-control practitioners regarding the
prevention and control of nosocomial pneumonia in U.S. hospitals. Sections on the prevention of bacterial pneumonia
in mechanically ventilated and/or critically ill patients, care of respiratory-therapy devices, prevention of
cross-contamination, and prevention of viral lower respiratory-tract infections, such as respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) and influenza infections, have been expanded and updated. New sections on Legionnaires' disease and
pneumonia due to 

Aspergillus

 spp. have been added. Lower respiratory tract infection due to 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis

 is not addressed in this document; it is covered in separate guidelines.






Part I, Issues for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia_1994, can be an important resource for educating healthcare
workers regarding prevention and control of nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Because education of healthcare
workers is the cornerstone of an effective infection control program, hospitals should give high priority to continuing
infection control educational programs for these staff members. 


PART I. ISSUES ON PREVENTION OF NOSOCOMIAL PNEUMONIA_1994 
BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA 


I. Etiologic Agents 


The reported distribution of etiologic agents causing nosocomial pneumonia varies between hospitals because of
differences in patient populations and diagnostic methods employed.

2-11

 In general, however, bacteria have been the most frequently isolated pathogens.

2-7,10,12-14

 Schaberg et al. reported that in 1986-1989, aerobic bacteria comprised at least 73%, and fungi 4%, of isolates
from sputum and tracheal aspirates of cases at the University of Michigan Hospitals and hospitals participating
in the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS); very few anaerobic bacteria and no viruses were reported,
probably because anaerobic and viral cultures were not performed routinely in the reporting hospitals (Table 1).

4

 Similarly, cultures of bronchoscopic specimens from mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia have rarely
yielded anaerobes.

6-8,10,12,15,16

 Only the report by Bartlett, which was based mainly on cultures of transtracheal aspirates in patients not receiving
mechanically assisted ventilation, showed a predominance of anaerobes.

5

 
Nosocomial bacterial pneumonias are frequently polymicrobial,

5,8,10,12,13,16-20

 and gram-negative bacilli are the usual predominant organisms (Table 1);

2-7,10,12-14

 however, 

Staphylococcus aureus

 (especially methicillin-resistant 

S. aureus

)

6,8,11,16,21

 and other gram-positive cocci, including 

Streptococcus pneumoniae,



6,8

 have recently emerged as significant isolates;

15

 and 

Haemophilus influenza

 has been isolated from mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia that occurs within 48-96 hours after
intubation.

4-6,13,16,22

 In NNIS hospitals, 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter 

sp.,

 Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus

 spp. comprised 50% of the isolates from cultures of respiratory tract specimens of patients for whom nosocomial pneumonia
was diagnosed by using clinical criteria; 

S. aureus

 accounted for 16%, and 

H. influenzae,

 for 6% (Table 1).

4

 Fagon and co-workers reported that gram-negative bacilli were present in 75% of quantitative cultures of protected-specimen
brushings (PSB) from patients who had received mechanically assisted ventilation and acquired nosocomial pneumonia;
40% were polymicrobial.

6

 In the report by Torres et al., 20% of pathogens recovered from cultures of PSB, blood, pleural fluid, or percutaneous
lung aspirate were gram-negative bacilli in pure culture, and 17% were polymicrobial; however, 54% of specimens
did not yield any microorganism, probably because of receipt of antibiotics by patients.

7

 


II. Diagnosis 


The diagnosis of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia has been difficult.

8,9,17,23-32

 Frequently, the criteria for diagnosis have been fever, cough, and development of purulent sputum, in combination
with radiologic evidence of a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate, a suggestive Gram's stain, and cultures of
sputum, tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, or blood.

4,5,23,25,33-36

 Although clinical criteria together with cultures of sputum or tracheal specimens may be sensitive for bacterial
pathogens, they are highly nonspecific, especially in patients with mechanically assisted ventilation;

9,10,13-16,19,24-26,29,31,37-42

 on the other hand, cultures of blood or pleural fluid have very low sensitivity.

9,19,20,43

 
Because of these problems, a group of investigators recently formulated consensus recommendations for standardization
of methods to diagnose pneumonia in clinical research studies of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

44-46

 These methods involve bronchoscopic techniques, e.g., quantitative culture of PSB,

6,8-10,14,16,27,31,38,41,47,48

 BAL,

8,13,41,47,49-54

 and pBAL.

15

 The reported sensitivities and specificities of these methods have ranged between 70% to 100% and 60% to 100%, respectively,
depending on the tests or diagnostic criteria they were compared with. Because these techniques are invasive, they
may cause complications such as hypoxemia, bleeding, or arrhythmia.

9,14,42,44,52,55,56

 In addition, the sensitivity of the PSB procedure may decrease in patients receiving antibiotic therapy.

10,14,27

 Nonbronchoscopic (NB) procedures, e.g., NB-pBAL

13,27,57,58

 or NB-PSB,

14

 which utilize blind catheterization of the distal airways, have been developed recently; however, they have not
been extensively evaluated. Although the use of bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic diagnostic tests can be a major
step in better defining the epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia especially in mechanically ventilated patients,
further studies are needed to determine their applicability in daily clinical practice.

NNIS reports that pneumonias (diagnosed on the basis of the CDC surveillance definition of nosocomial pneumonia)
and surgical-wound infections account for approximately 15% each of all hospital-associated infections and are
the second most common nosocomial infections after that of the urinary tract.

3

 In 1984, the overall incidence of lower respiratory tract infection was 6 per 1,000 discharged patients.

3

 The incidence ranged from 4.2 to 7.7 per 1,000 discharged patients for nonteaching and university-affiliated hospitals,
respectively, probably reflecting institutional differences in the level of patients' risk for acquiring nosocomial
pneumonia. 
Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia often has been identified as a postoperative infection.

59,60

 In the Study of the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control in the 1970s, 75% of reported cases of nosocomial bacterial
pneumonia occurred in patients who had had a surgical operation; the risk was 38 times greater for thoracoabdominal
procedures than for those involving other body sites.

60

 More recent epidemiologic studies, including NNIS studies, have identified other subsets of patients at high risk
of developing nosocomial bacterial pneumonia: Patients with endotracheal intubation and/or mechanically assisted
ventilation, depressed level of consciousness (particularly those with closed-head injury), prior episode of
a large-volume aspiration, or underlying chronic lung disease, and patients >70 years of age. Other risk factors include
24-hour ventilator-circuit changes, fall-winter season, stress-bleeding prophylaxis with cimetidine with or
without antacid, presence of a nasogastric tube, severe trauma, and recent bronchoscopy.

7,34,35,61-69

 
Recently, NNIS stratified the incidence density of nosocomial pneumonia by patients' use of mechanical ventilator
and type of intensive care unit (ICU). From 1986 to 1990, the median rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1,000
ventilator-days ranged from 4.7 in pediatric ICUs to 34.4 in burn ICUs.

63

 In contrast, the median rate of nonventilator-associated pneumonia per 1000 ICU-days ranged from 0 in pediatric
and respiratory ICUs to 3.2 in trauma ICUs. 
Nosocomial pneumonia has been associated with high fatality rates. Crude mortality rates of 20%-50% and attributable
mortality rates of 30%-33% have been reported; in one study, pneumonia comprised 60% of all deaths due to nosocomial
infections.

18,35,70-75

 Patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation have higher mortality rates than patients not receiving
ventilation support; however, other factors, such as a patient's underlying disease(s) and organ failure, are stronger
predictors of death in patients with pneumonia.

34

 
Pneumonia-associated morbidity has not been evaluated in recent years. Past studies, however, have shown that pneumonia
could prolong hospitalization by 4-9 days.

74-77

 A conservative estimate of the direct cost of excess hospital stay due to pneumonia is $1.1 billion a year for the nation.

78

 Because of its reported frequency, associated high fatality rate, and attendant costs, nosocomial pneumonia is
a major infection control problem. 


IV. Pathogenesis 


Bacteria may invade the lower respiratory tract by aspiration of oropharyngeal organisms, inhalation of aerosols
containing bacteria, or less frequently, by hematogenous spread from a distant body site (Figure 1). In addition,
bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract has been recently hypothesized as a mechanism for infection.
Of these routes, aspiration is believed to be the most important for both nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia.

In radioisotope-tracer studies of healthy adults, 45% were found to aspirate during sleep.

79

 Persons with abnormal swallowing, such as those who have depressed consciousness, respiratory tract instrumentation
and/or mechanically assisted ventilation, gastrointestinal tract instrumentation or diseases, or have just undergone
surgery, are particularly likely to aspirate.

7,34,35,60,80

 
The high incidence of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in hospitalized patients appears to be the result of factors
that promote colonization of the pharynx by gram-negative bacilli and the subsequent entry of these organisms into
the lower respiratory tract.

33,81-84

 Whereas aerobic gram-negative bacilli are recovered infrequently or are found in small numbers in pharyngeal cultures
of healthy persons,

81,85

 colonization dramatically increases in patients with coma, hypotension, acidosis, azotemia, alcoholism, diabetes
mellitus, leukocytosis, leukopenia, pulmonary disease, nasogastric or endotracheal tubes in place, and in patients
given antimicrobial agents.

33,84,86,87

 
Oropharyngeal or tracheobronchial colonization by gram-negative bacilli begins with the adherence of the microorganisms
to the host's epithelial cells.

83,88-90

 Adherence may be affected by multiple factors related to the bacteria (presence of pili, cilia, capsule, or production
of elastase or mucinase), host cell (surface proteins and polysaccharides), and environment (pH and presence of
mucin in respiratory secretions).

82,83,88,91-100

 The exact interactions among these factors have not been fully elucidated, but studies indicate that certain substances,
such as fibronectin, can inhibit the adherence of gram-negative bacilli to host cells.

91,93,101

 Conversely, certain conditions, such as malnutrition, severe illness, or post-operative state, can increase adherence
of gram-negative bacteria.

82,91,95,100,102

 
Besides the oropharynx, the stomach has been postulated to be an important reservoir of organisms that cause nosocomial
pneumonia.

34,103-107

 The stomach's role may vary depending on the patient's underlying conditions and on prophylactic or therapeutic
interventions.

22,104,108-111

 In healthy persons, few bacteria entering the stomach survive in the presence of hydrochloric acid at pH<2.

112,113

 However, when gastric pH increases from the normal levels to >4, microorganisms are able to multiply to high concentrations
in the stomach.

110,112,114-116

 This can occur in patients with advanced age,

114

 achlorhydria,

112

 ileus, or upper gastrointestinal disease, and in patients receiving enteral feeding, antacids, or histamine-2
[H-2] antagonists.

104,110,111,116-118

 The contribution of other factors, such as duodeno-gastric reflux and the presence of bile, to gastric colonization
in patients with impaired intestinal motility has been suggested and needs further investigation.

109

 
Bacteria can also gain entry into the lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients through inhalation of aerosols
generated primarily by contaminated respiratory-therapy or anesthesia-breathing equipment.

119-122

 Outbreaks related to the use of respiratory-therapy equipment have been associated with contaminated nebulizers,
which are humidification devices that produce large amounts of aerosol droplets <4 u m via ultrasound, spinning
disk, or the Venturi mechanism.

119,122,123

 When the fluid in the reservoir of a nebulizer becomes contaminated with bacteria, the aerosol produced may contain
high concentrations of bacteria that can be deposited deep in the patient's lower respiratory tract.

119,123,124

 Because endotracheal and tracheal tubes provide direct access to the lower respiratory tract, contaminated aerosol
inhalation is particularly hazardous for intubated patients. In contrast to nebulizers, bubble-through or wick
humidifiers mainly increase the water-vapor (or molecular-water) content of inspired gases. Although heated bubble-through
humidifiers generate aerosol droplets, they do so in quantities that may not be clinically significant;

120,125

 wick humidifiers do not generate aerosols. 
Rarely, bacterial pneumonia can result from hematogenous spread of infection to the lung from another infection
site, e.g., pneumonia resulting from purulent phlebitis or right-sided endocarditis. Another mechanism, translocation
of bacteria via the passage of viable bacteria from the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract through epithelial mucosa
to the mesenteric lymph nodes and to the lung has been shown in animal models.

126

 Translocation is postulated to occur in patients with immunosuppression, cancer or burns;

126

 however data are lacking regarding this mechanism in humans.

V. Risk Factors and Control Measures



Several large studies have examined potential risk factors for nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (Table 3).

7,34,35,128,129

 Although specific risk factors may differ between study populations, they can be grouped into the following general
categories: (1) Host factors such as extremes of age and severe underlying conditions, including immunosuppression;
(2) factors, such as admission to the ICU, underlying chronic lung disease, or coma, that enhance colonization of
the oropharynx and/or stomach by microorganisms; (3) conditions favoring aspiration or reflux, including endotracheal
intubation or insertion of nasogastric tube; (4) conditions requiring prolonged use of mechanical ventilatory
support with exposure to contaminated respiratory equipment and/or contact with colonized hands of healthcare
workers; and (5) factors that impede adequate pulmonary toilet, such as surgical procedures involving the head,
neck, thorax, or upper abdomen, and immobilization due to trauma or illness.

7,33-35,59,128





A. Oropharyngeal, Tracheal, and Gastric Colonization



The association between colonization of the oropharynx,

81,130

 trachea,

131

 or stomach

103,104,110,116

 and predisposition to gram-negative bacillary pneumonia prompted attempts to prevent infection either by prophylactic
local application of antimicrobial agent(s)

132,133

 or utilizing the phenomenon of local bacterial interference.

134,135

 Although early work suggested that the former method, aerosolized antimicrobials, could eradicate common gram-negative
pathogens from the upper respiratory tract,

131

 superinfection occurred in some patients receiving this therapy.

132-134,136,137

 The latter method, bacterial interference (with alpha-hemolytic streptococci), has been successfully used by
some investigators to prevent oropharyngeal colonization by aerobic gram-negative bacilli.

134

 However, the efficacy of this method for use in general has not been evaluated.

The administration of antacids and H2-blockers for prevention of stress bleeding in critically ill, postoperative,
and/or mechanically ventilated patients has been associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth in many studies.

34,105,106,111,115,116,138-140

 Sucralfate, a cytoprotective agent that has little effect on gastric pH and may have bactericidal properties of its
own, has been suggested as a potential substitute for antacids and H2-blockers.

141-143

 The results of clinical trials comparing the risk of pneumonia in patients receiving sucralfate to that in patients
given antacids and/or H2-blockers have been variable.

105,111,140,141,144,145

 In most randomized trials, ICU patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation and antacids with or without
H2-b lockers had increased gastric pH, high bacterial counts in the gastric fluid, and increased risk of pneumonia
compared with patients given sucralfate.

105,111,140,141,144

 In one report with a large number of study patients, the incidence of early-onset pneumonia (occurring >4 days
after intubation) did not differ between patient groups, but late-onset pneumonia occurred in 5% of 76 patients who
received sucralfate, 16% of 69 given antacids, and 21% of 68 who received an H2-blocker.

140

 On the other hand, a meta-analysis of data from eight earlier studies did not show a strong association between nosocomial
pneumonia and drugs that raise gastric pH.

146

 Further comparative studies are underway in which bronchoscopy with PSB or BAL is utilized for the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is another strategy designed to prevent bacterial colonization
and lower respiratory tract infection in mechanically ventilated patients.

147-170

 SDD is aimed at preventing oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with aerobic gram-negative bacilli and 

Candida 

spp., without altering the anaerobic flora (Table 2).

147-170

 A variety of SDD regimens use a combination of locally administered nonabsorbable antibiotic agents such as polymyxin,
an aminoglycoside (tobramycin, gentamicin, or, rarely, neomycin), or a quinolone (norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin),
coupled with either amphotericin B or nystatin. The local antimicrobial preparation is applied as a paste to the oropharynx
and given orally or via the nasogastric tube four times a day. In addition, in many studies, a systemic (intravenous)
antimicrobial such as cefotaxime or trimethoprim is administered to the patient.

While most clinical trials,

147-151,153-160,162,164,169

 including two meta-analyses,

163,170

 of SDD have demonstrated a decrease in the rates of nosocomial respiratory infections, these trials have been difficult
to assess because they have differed in study design and population, and many have had short follow-up periods (Table
2). In most of these studies, the diagnosis of pneumonia was based on clinical criteria; bronchoscopy with BAL or PSB
was used in only a few studies.

152,153,164,167,169



Two recently published large double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated no benefit from SDD.

166,167

 In one, a large French multicenter study by Gastinne et al, a significant decrease in incidence of gram-negative bacillary
pneumonia was not accompanied by a decrease in pneumonia from all causes.

167

 In the other study, by Hammond et al, no differences were noted between patients randomized to SDD or to placebo; however,
both patient groups received intravenous cefotaxime.

166



Although an earlier meta-analysis suggested a trend toward decreased mortality in patients given SDD,

163

 a more recent and more extensive analysis highlights the equivocal effect of SDD on patient mortality, as well as the
high cost of using SDD to prevent pneumonia or death (i.e., in order to prevent one case of nosocomial pneumonia, or
one death due to nosocomial pneumonia, 6 [range: 5-9] or 23 [range: 13-39] patients, respectively, would
have to be given SDD.

170

 Furthermore, there are concerns over the development of antimicrobial resistance and superinfection with gram-positive
bacteria and other antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

148,149,152,155

 Thus, currently available data do not justify the routine use of SDD for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia in ICU
patients. SDD may be ultimately useful for specific subsets of ICU patients, such as those with trauma or severe immunosuppression,
e.g., bone-marrow transplant recipients.

A new approach advocated to prevent oropharyngeal colonization in patients receiving enteral nutrition is to reduce
bacterial colonization of the stomach by acidifying the enteral feed.

171

 Although the absence of bacteria from the stomach has been confirmed in patients given acidified enteral feeding,
the effect on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia has not been evaluated.

B. Aspiration of Oropharyngeal and Gastric Flora



Clinically significant aspiration usually occurs in patients who have one or more of the following conditions: a
depressed level of consciousness, dysphagia due to neurologic or esophageal disorders, an endotracheal (naso-
or oro-tracheal) and nasogastric tube in place, and receipt of enteral feeding.

35,79,80,172-176

 Placement of nasogastric tube may increase nasopharyngeal colonization, cause reflux of gastric contents, or allow
bacterial migration via the tube from the stomach to the upper airway.

173,176-178

 When enteral feedings are administered, gross contamination of the enteral solution during preparation

179-181

 and elevated gastric pH

67,182,183

 may lead to gastric colonization with gram-negative bacilli. In addition, gastric reflux and aspiration may occur
because of increased intragastric volume and pressure.

67,110,173



Prevention of pneumonia in such patients may be difficult, but methods that make regurgitation less likely, for example,
placing the patient in a semirecumbent position by elevating the head of the bed,

175,184,185

 administering enteral nutrition intermittently in small boluses rather than continuously,

67,183

 using flexible, small-bore enteral tubes,

176,186

 and witholding enteral feeding when the residual volume in the stomach is large or if bowel sounds are not heard upon
auscultation of the abdomen, may be beneficial.

175,187,188

 On the other hand, placing the enteral tube below the stomach (e.g. in the jejunum) has yielded equivocal results.

189,190





C. Mechanically Assisted Ventilation and Endotracheal Intubation



Patients receiving continuous, mechanically assisted ventilation have 6-21 times the risk of developing
nosocomial pneumonia compared with patients not receiving ventilatory support.

34,60,62,70

 Data from the study by Fagon and co-workers indicate that the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia
increases by 1% per day.

6

 This increased risk is partly due to carriage of oropharyngeal organisms upon passage of the endotracheal tube into
the trachea during intubation, as well as to depressed host defenses secondary to the patient's severe underlying
illness.

7,34,35,191

 In addition, bacteria can aggregate on the surface of the tube over time and form a glycocalyx (biofilm) that protects
the bacteria from action of antimicrobial agents or host defenses.

192

 Some investigators believe that these bacterial aggregates may become dislodged by ventilation flow, tube manipulation,
or suctioning, and subsequently embolize into the lower respiratory tract and cause focal pneumonia.

193,194

 Removing tracheal secretions by gentle suctioning and using aseptic technique to reduce cross-contamination from
respiratory therapy equipment or hands of personnel have been utilized traditionally to help prevent pneumonia
in patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation.

The risk of pneumonia is also increased by the direct access of bacteria to the lower respiratory tract, often because
of leakage around the endotracheal cuff,

195,196

 which allows pooled secretions above the cuff to enter the trachea.

197

 In one recent study, the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia was delayed and decreased in intubated patients whose
endotracheal tubes had a separate dorsal lumen that allowed drainage (by suctioning) of secretions in the space above
endotracheal cuff and below the glottis.

197

 However, further studies are needed to determine the cost-benefit ratio of using this device.



D. Cross-Colonization Via Hands of Personnel



Pathogens causing nosocomial pneumonia, such as gram-negative bacilli and 

Staphylococcus aureus

, are ubiquitous in the hospital, especially in intensive or critical care areas.

198,199

 Transmission of these microorganisms to patients frequently occurs via healthcare workers' hands that become contaminated
or transiently colonized with the microorganisms.

200-205

 Procedures such as tracheal suctioning and manipulation of ventilator circuit or endotracheal tubes increase the
opportunity for cross-contamination. The risk of cross-contamination can be reduced by using aseptic technique
and sterile or disinfected equipment when appropriate

62

 and eliminating pathogens from the hands of personnel.

62,206-208



In theory, adequate handwashing is an effective way of removing transient bacteria from the hands,

207,208

 but personnel compliance with handwashing has been generally poor, despite the best efforts at educating healthcare
workers.

209-212

 For this reason, the routine use of gloves has been advocated to help prevent cross-contamination.

213,214

 Routine gloving (in addition to gowning) was associated with a decrease in the incidence of nosocomial respiratory-syncytial
virus (RSV)

215

 and other ICU infections.

216

 It should be emphasized, however, that nosocomial pathogens can colonize gloves,

217

 and that outbreaks have been traced to healthcare workers who did not change gloves after patient contact.

218





E. Contamination of Devices Used on the Respiratory Tract



Devices used on the respiratory tract for respiratory therapy (e.g., nebulizer), diagnostic examination (e.g.,
bronchoscope or spirometer), and administration of anesthesia are potential reservoirs or vehicles for infectious
microorganisms.

62,219-221

 Routes of transmission may be from device to patient,

120,122,221-230

 from one patient to another, or from one body site to the lower respiratory tract of the same patient via hand or device.

220,231,232

 Contaminated nebulizer reservoirs can allow the growth of hydrophilic bacteria that may be subsequently aerosolized
during device use.

119,122,123,228

 Gram-negative bacilli such as 

Pseudomonas 

spp., 

Xanthomonas 

spp., 

Flavobacterium 

spp., 

Legionella 

spp., and nontuberculous mycobacteria can multiply to substantial concentrations in nebulizer fluid

227,233-235

 and increase the patient's risk of acquiring pneumonia.

120-123,227,228,236,237

<TEXT>
 

Proper cleaning and sterilization or disinfection of reusable equipment are important components of a program to
reduce infections associated with respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment.

221-226,238,239

 Respiratory therapy devices have been classified as semi-critical because they come into contact with mucous membranes
but do not ordinarily penetrate body surfaces, and the associated infection risk following their use in patients
is less than that associated with devices that penetrate normally sterile tissues (See Appendix A).

240

 There is no evidence that low-level contamination of respiratory therapy device prior to use by a patient, as may occur
following high-level disinfection of the device, presents a greater risk of respiratory infection than does sterile
equipment. Thus, if after they are thoroughly cleaned, these devices cannot be sterilized by steam autoclave or ethylene
oxide,

241

 they can be subjected to high-level disinfection by pasteurization at 75
 C for 30 min,

242-244

 or by using liquid chemical disinfectants approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as sterilants/disinfectants.

214,245-247

 When rinsing is needed after a respiratory device has been sterilized or disinfected, only sterile water is used because
tap or locally-prepared distilled water may harbor microorganisms that can cause pneumonia.

233,234,248-250



1. Mechanical Ventilators and Anesthesia Machines 



The internal machinery of mechanical ventilators and anesthesia machines is not considered an important source
of bacterial contamination of inhaled air.251

 Thus, routine sterilization or high-level disinfection of the internal machinery is considered unnecessary. Using
high-efficiency bacterial filters at various positions in the breathing circuit had been advocated previously.

252,253

 Filters interposed between the machinery and the main breathing circuit can eliminate contaminants from the driving
gas and prevent retrograde contamination of the machine by the patient but may also alter the functional specifications
of the breathing device by impeding high gas flows.

252,253

 In addition, when used with anesthesia equipment, filters placed between the inspiratory-phase circuit and the
patient have not been shown to prevent infections.

254,255

 Placement of a filter or condensate trap at the expiratory-phase tubing of the mechanical-ventilator circuit may
help prevent cross-contamination of the ventilated patient's immediate environment,

231,256

 but the importance of such filters in preventing nosocomial pneumonia needs further evaluation. 



2. Humidifiers, Breathing Circuits, and Heat-Moisture Exchangers



Most U.S. hospitals currently use ventilators with either bubble-through or wick humidifiers that produce either
insignificant

125,257

 or no aerosols, respectively, for humidification. Thus, they do not seem to pose an important risk for pneumonia in
patients. In addition, bubble-through humidifiers are usually heated to temperatures that reduce or eliminate
bacterial pathogens.

257,258

 Sterile water, however, is still generally used to fill these humidifiers

259

 because tap or distilled water may harbor 

Legionella

 spp. that are more heat-resistant than other bacteria.

236,250


 
The potential risk for pneumonia in patients using mechanical ventilators with heated bubble-through humidifiers
stems primarily from the condensate that forms in the inspiratory-phase tubing of the ventilator circuit as a result
of the difference in the temperatures of the inspiratory-phase gas and ambient air; condensate formation increases
if the tubing is unheated.

260

 The tubing and condensate can rapidly become contaminated, usually with bacteria that originate from the patient's
oropharynx.

260

 In the study by Craven et al, 33% of inspiratory circuits were colonized with bacteria from patients' oropharynx within
2 hours and 80% within 24 hours of use.

260

 Spillage of the contaminated condensate into the patient's tracheobronchial tree, as can occur during procedures
in which the tubing may be moved (e.g., suctioning, adjusting the ventilator setting, or feeding or caring for the
patient), may increase the risk of pneumonia in the patient.

260

 Thus, in many hospitals, healthcare workers are trained to prevent such spillage and to drain the fluid periodically.
Microorganisms contaminating ventilator-circuit condensate can be transmitted to other patients via hands of
the healthcare worker handling the fluid, especially if the healthcare worker fails to wash his or her hands after
handling the condensate. 

The role of ventilator-tubing changes in preventing pneumonia in patients using mechanical ventilators with bubble-through
humidifiers has been investigated. Initial studies of in-use contamination of mechanical ventilator circuits
with humidifiers have shown that neither the rate of bacterial contamination of inspiratory-phase gas nor the incidence
of pneumonia was significantly increased when tubings were changed every 24 hours rather than every 8 or 16 hours.

261

 Craven et al later showed that changing the ventilator circuit every 48 hours rather than 24 hours did not result in
an increase in contamination of the inspiratory-phase gas or tubing of the ventilator circuits.262 In addition,
the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was not significantly higher when circuits were changed every 48 hours than
when changes were done every 24 hours.262 More recent reports suggest that the risk of pneumonia may not increase when
the interval for circuit change is prolonged beyond 48 hours. Dreyfuss and others showed that the risk of pneumonia
(8 [29%] of 28) was not significantly higher when the circuits were never changed for the duration of use by the patient,
than (11 [31%] of 35) when the circuits were changed every 48 hours.263
 
These findings indicate that the recommended daily change in ventilator circuits may be extended to "48 hours. This
change in recommendation is expected to result in large savings in device use and personnel time for U.S. hospitals.

259,262

 The maximum time, however, that a circuit can be safely left unchanged on a patient has yet to be determined. 

Condensate formation in the inspiratory-phase tubing of a ventilator breathing circuit can be decreased by elevating
the temperature of the inspiratory-phase gas with a heated wire in the inspiratory-phase tubing. However, in one
report, three cases of endotracheal- or tracheostomy-tube blockage by dried-up patient secretions were attributed
to the decrease in the relative humidity of inspired gas that results from the elevation of the gas temperature.264
Until further data are available about the frequency of the occurrence of such cases, users of heated ventilator tubing
should be aware of the advantages and potential complications of using heated tubing.

<TEXT>
 

Condensate formation can be eliminated by using a heat-moisture exchanger (HME) or a hygroscopic condenser humidifier
(``artificial nose'').

265,270

 An HME recycles heat and moisture exhaled by the patient, and eliminates the need for a humidifier. In the absence of
a humidifier, no condensate forms in the inspiratory-phase tubing of the ventilator circuit. Thus, bacterial colonization
of the tubing is prevented, and the need to routinely change tubings periodically is obviated. Some models of HMEs
are equipped with bacterial filters, but the advantage of these filters remains unknown. HMEs can increase the dead
space and resistance to breathing, may leak around the endotracheal tube, and may result in drying of sputum and blockage
of the tracheo-bronchial tree.

271

 Although recently developed HMEs with humidifiers increase airway humidity without increasing colonization with
bacteria,

267,272

 more studies are needed to determine whether the incidence of pneumonia is decreased.

273-276



3. Large-Volume Nebulizers



Nebulizers with large-volume (>500 cc) reservoirs, including those used in intermittent positive-pressure breathing
(IPPB) machines and ultrasonic or spinning-disk room-air ``humidifiers,'' pose the greatest risk of pneumonia
to patients, probably because of the total amount of aerosol they generate.222,225,227,236,277

 These reservoirs can become contaminated by hands of personnel, unsterile humidification fluid, or inadequate
sterilization or disinfection between uses.119 Once introduced into the reservoir, various bacteria, including


Legionella

 spp., can multiply to sufficiently large numbers within 24 hours to pose a risk of infection in patients who receive
inhalation therapy.

121,122,227,237,277

 Sterilization or high-level disinfection of these nebulizers can eliminate vegetative bacteria from their reservoirs
and make them safe for patient use.240 Unlike nebulizers attached to IPPB machines, however, room-air ``humidifiers''
have a high cost-benefit ratio: evidence of clinical benefits from their use in hospitals is lacking, and the potential
cost of daily sterilization or disinfection of, and use of sterile water to fill, such devices is substantial. 



4. Small-Volume Medication Nebulizers



Small-volume medication nebulizers for administration of bronchodilators, including those that are hand-held
and those that are in the inspiratory circuit of mechanical ventilators, can produce bacterial aerosols.228 Hand-held
nebulizers have rarely been associated with nosocomial pneumonia, and only when contaminated by medications from
multidose vials.278 Medication nebulizers inserted in the ventilator circuit (``in-line'') may become contaminated
by condensate in the inspiratory tubing and increase the patient's risk of pneumonia because the nebulizer aerosol
is directed through the endotracheal tube and bypasses many of the normal host defenses against infection.260 



5. Suction Catheters, Resuscitation Bags, Oxygen Analyzers, and Ventilator Spirometers



Tracheal suction catheters can introduce microorganisms into a patient's lower respiratory tract. Preliminary
studies suggest that the risk of pneumonia is not different between patients on whom the single-use suction method
is used and those on whom the newly developed closed multi-use catheter system is used.279 In addition, the advantages
of using one system over the other, in terms of oxygen desaturation in patients and less environmental contamination,
have not been clearly shown.

280-282

Resuscitation bags are particularly difficult to clean and dry between uses; microorganisms in secretions or fluid
left in the bag may be aerosolized and/or sprayed into the lower respiratory tract of the patient on whom the bag is used;
in addition, contaminating microorganisms may be transmitted from one patient to another via hands of staff members.283-285

 Oxygen analyzers and ventilator spirometers have been associated with outbreaks of gram-negative respiratory
tract colonization and pneumonia resulting from patient-to-patient transmission of organisms via hands of personnel.

220,286

 These devices require sterilization or high-level disinfection between uses on different patients. Education
of physicians, respiratory therapists, and nursing staff regarding the associated risks and appropriate care of
these devices is essential. 



F. Thoraco-Abdominal Surgical Procedures 



Certain patients are at high risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications, including pneumonia. These
persons include those who are more than 70 years of age, are obese, or have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

287-290

 Abnormal pulmonary function tests (especially decreased maximum expiration flow rate), a history of smoking, the
presence of tracheostomy or prolonged intubation, or protein depletion that can cause respiratory-muscle weakness
are also risk factors.

59,65,129

 Patients who undergo surgery of the head, neck, thorax, or abdomen may suffer from impairment of normal swallowing
and respiratory clearance mechanisms as a result of instrumentation of the respiratory tract, anesthesia, or increased
use of narcotics and sedatives;

288,291,292

 patients who undergo upper abdominal surgery usually suffer from diaphragmatic dysfunction that results in decreased
functional residual capacity of the lungs, closure of airways, and atelectasis.

293,294

 Interventions aimed at reducing the postoperative patient's risk of pneumonia have been developed.295 These include
deep breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, use of incentive spirometry, IPPB, and continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) by face mask.

295-305

 Studies evaluating the relative efficacy of these modalities have shown variable results, and have been difficult
to compare because of differences in outcome variables assessed, patient populations studied, and study design.

295,297,298,304-307

 Nevertheless, many studies have found deep breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, use of incentive spirometry,
and IPPB as advantageous maneuvers, especially in patients with preoperative pulmonary dysfunction.

298,299,301,302,304-306

 In addition, control of pain that interferes with cough and deep breathing during the immediate postoperative period
has been shown to decrease the incidence of pulmonary complications after surgery; several methods of controlling
pain have been used; these include intramuscular or intravenous (including patient-controlled) administration,
or regional (e.g., epidural) analgesia.

308-315

G. Other Prophylactic Measures 



1. Vaccination of Patients



Although pneumococci are not a major cause of nosocomial pneumonia, they have been identified as etiologic agents
of serious nosocomial pulmonary infection and bacteremia.316-318

 The following factors render patients at high risk of complications from pneumococcal infections: "65 years of age,
chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, cerebrospinal fluid
leaks, immunosuppression, functional or anatomic asplenia, or HIV infection. Pneumococcal vaccine is effective
in preventing pneumococcal disease.

319,320

 Because two-thirds or more of patients with serious pneumococcal disease have been hospitalized at least once within
5 years before their pneumococcal illness, offering pneumococcal vaccine in hospitals, e.g., at the time of patient
discharge, should contribute substantially to preventing the disease.

319,321 





2. Prophylaxis With Systemic Antimicrobial Agents 



Systemic antimicrobial administration has been a prevalent practice in the prevention of nosocomial infections,
including pneumonia, especially in patients who are weaned off mechanical ventilators, postoperative, and/or
critically ill.

322

 However, the efficacy of such practice is questionable; and the potential for superinfection, which may result from
any antimicrobial therapy, is a problem.

84,322-326



3. Kinetic Therapy for the Immobilized State 



Continuous lateral rotational therapy (CLRT) or ``kinetic'' therapy is a recently introduced maneuver for prevention
of pulmonary and other complications from prolonged immobilization or bed rest, such as in patients with acute stroke,
critical illness, head injury or traction, blunt chest trauma, and/or mechanically assisted ventilation.327-332

 CLRT involves the use of a bed that turns continuously and slowly (about eight full rotations per hour) along its longitudinal
axis. Among the hypothesized benefits of CLRT are improved drainage of secretions within the lungs and lower airways,
increased tidal volume, and reduction of venous thrombosis with resultant pulmonary embolization.

174,333-335

 However, the efficacy of CLRT in preventing pneumonia needs further evaluation because available studies yielded
variable results.

327-330

 In addition, the studies either involved small numbers of patients,

328

 lacked adequate randomization,

327

 had no clear definition of pneumonia,

327

 did not distinguish between community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia,

328,332

 or did not adjust for possible confounding factors such as mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, nasogastric
intubation, and enteral feeding.

327 





LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE 



Legionnaires' disease is a multisystem illness, with pneumonia, caused by 

Legionella spp. 

In contrast, Pontiac fever is a self-limited influenza-like illness, without pneumonia, that is associated with


Legionella

 spp.

336


 


I. Epidemiology 



Since identification of the etiologic agent, numerous outbreaks of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease have been
reported and have provided the opportunity to study the epidemiology of epidemic legionellosis. In contrast, the
epidemiology of endemic Legionnaires' disease has not been well elucidated. The overall proportion of nosocomial
pneumonias due to 

Legionella

 spp. in North America has not been determined, although individual hospitals have reported a ranges of 0%-14%.

337-339

 Because diagnostic tests for 

Legionella spp. 

infection are not routinely performed on all patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia in most hospitals, this
range probably underestimates the incidence of Legionnaires' disease.
 


Legionella 

spp. are commonly found in a variety of natural and man-made aquatic environments

340,341

 and may enter hospital water systems in low or undetectable numbers.

342,343

 Cooling towers, evaporative condensers, heated potable-water-distribution systems within hospitals, and locally
produced distilled water can provide a suitable environment for legionellae to multiply. Factors known to enhance
colonization and amplification of legionellae in man-made water environments include temperatures of 25-42
 C,

344-349

 stagnation,

350

 scale and sediment,

346

 and the presence of certain free-living aquatic amoebae that are capable of supporting intracellular growth of legionellae.

351,352 



A person's risk of acquiring legionellosis following exposure to contaminated water depends on a number of factors,
including the type and intensity of exposure and the exposed person's health status.

353-355

 Persons with severe immunosuppression or chronic underlying illnesses, such as hematologic malignancy or end-stage
renal disease, are at markedly increased risk for legionellosis.

355-358

 Persons in the later stages of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are also probably at increased risk of legionellosis,
but data are limited because of infrequent testing of patients. Persons with diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease,
or non-hematologic malignancy, those who smoke cigarettes, and the elderly are at moderately increased risk.

336

 Nosocomial Legionnaires' disease has also been reported among patients at children's hospitals.

359,360

 

Underlying disease and advanced age are not only risk factors for acquiring Legionnaires' disease but also for dying
from the illness. In a multivariate analysis of 3,524 cases reported to CDC from 1980 through 1989, immunosuppression,
advanced age, end-stage renal disease, cancer, and nosocomial acquisition of disease were each independently associated
with a fatal outcome.

355

 The mortality rate among 803 persons with nosocomially acquired cases was 40% compared with 20% among 2,721 persons
with community-acquired cases,

355

 probably reflecting increased severity of underlying disease in hospitalized patients.

II. Diagnosis 



The clinical spectrum of disease due to 

Legionella 

spp. is broad and ranges from asymptomatic infection to rapidly progressive pneumonia. Legionnaires' disease cannot
be distinguished clinically or radiographically from pneumonia caused by other agents,361,362 and evidence of
infection with other respiratory pathogens does not rule out the possibility of concomitant 

Legionella 

spp. infection.

363-365



The diagnosis of legionellosis may be confirmed by any one of the following: Culture isolation of 

Legionella

 from respiratory secretions or tissues, or microscopic visualization of the bacterium in respiratory secretions
or tissue by immunofluorescent microscopy; and, for legionellosis due to 

L. pneumophila

 serogroup 1, detection of 

L. pneumophila

 serogroup-1 antigens in urine by radioimmunoassay, or observation of a four-fold rise in 

L. pneumophila 

serogroup-1 antibody titer to "1:128 in paired acute and convalescent serum specimens by use of an indirect immunofluorescent
antibody test (IFA).366 A single elevated antibody titer does not confirm a case of Legionnaires' disease because
IFA titers "1:256 are found in 1-16% of healthy adults.

364,367-370



Because the above tests complement each other, performing each test when Legionnaires' disease is suspected increases
the probability of confirming the diagnosis.371 However, because none of the laboratory tests is 100% sensitive,
the diagnosis of legionellosis is not ruled out even if one or more of the tests are negative.

371,372

 Of the available tests, the most specific is culture isolation of 

Legionella 

sp. from any respiratory tract specimen.

373,374





III. Modes of Transmission 



Inhalation of aerosols of water contaminated with 

Legionella 

sp. is believed to be the primary mechanism of entry of these organisms into a patient's respiratory tract.336 In several
hospital outbreaks, patients were considered to be infected through exposure to contaminated aerosols generated
by cooling towers, showers, faucets, respiratory therapy equipment, and room-air humidifiers.

227,375-382 

In several studies, aspiration of contaminated potable water has been proposed as the mode of transmission to certain
patients.

383-385

 Person-to-person transmission, however, has not been observed.

IV. Definition of Nosocomial Legionnaires' Disease 



The incubation period for Legionnaires' disease is generally 2-10 days; thus, for epidemiologic purposes,
in this document and in the accompanying recommendations by the HICPAC, laboratory-confirmed legionellosis that
occurs in a patient who has spent "10 days continuously in the hospital prior to onset of illness is considered definite
nosocomial Legionnaires' disease, and laboratory-confirmed infection that occurs 2-10 days after hospitalization
is possible nosocomial infection. 



V. Prevention and Control Measures 



A. Prevention of Legionnaires' Disease in Hospitals With No Identified Cases (Primary Prevention) 



Prevention strategies in healthcare facilities with no cases of nosocomial legionellosis have varied by institution,
depending on the immunologic status of the patients, the design and construction of the facility, resources available
for implementation of prevention strategies, and state and local regulations. 

There are at least two schools of thought regarding the most appropriate and cost-effective approach to prevent nosocomial
legionellosis, especially in hospitals where no cases or only sporadic cases of the illness are detected. However,
a study comparing the cost-benefit ratios of these strategies has not been done. 

The first approach is based on periodic, routine culturing of water samples from the hospital's potable water system,
for 

Legionella 

spp.

387

 When a positive culture is obtained, the hospital's potable water system is decontaminated and diagnostic laboratory
tests for legionellosis are made available to clinicians in the hospital's microbiology department, so that active
surveillance for cases can be instituted.

388

 This approach is based on the premise that no cases of nosocomial legionellosis can occur in the absence of 

Legionella 

spp. from the potable water system, and, conversely, once 

Legionella 

spp. are cultured from the water, cases of nosocomial legionellosis may occur.

383,389 

Proponents of this strategy indicate that when physicians are informed that the potable water system of the hospital
is culture-positive for 

Legionella 

spp., they are more inclined to conduct the necessary tests for legionellosis.

388

 A potential advantage of this approach is the lower cost of culturing a limited number of water samples, if the testing
is done infrequently, compared with the cost of routine laboratory diagnostic testing for legionellosis in all patients
with nosocomial pneumonia in hospitals that have had no cases of nosocomial legionellosis. 

The main argument against this approach is that in the absence of cases, the relationship between the results of water
cultures and the risk of legionellosis remains undefined. The bacterium has been frequently present in hospital
water systems,

390

 often without being associated with known cases of disease.

250,338,391,392

 In a study of 84 hospitals in Quebec, 68% were found to be colonized with 

Legionella 

spp., and 26% were colonized at >30% of sites sampled; however, cases of Legionnaires' disease were rarely reported
from these hospitals.

250

 Similarly, at one hospital where active surveillance for legionellosis and environmental culturing for 

Legionella 

spp. were done, no cases of legionellosis occurred in a urology ward during a 3.5-month period when 70% of water samples
from the ward were culture-positive for 

L. pneumophila 

serogroup 1.

338

 Interpretation of the results of routine culturing of water may be confounded by variable culture results among sites
sampled within a single water system and by fluctuations in the concentration of 

Legionella 

spp. in the same site.

393,394

 In addition, the risk of illness following exposure to a given source may be influenced by a number of factors other
than the presence or concentration of organisms; these include the degree to which contaminated water is aerosolized
into respirable droplets, the proximity of the infectious aerosol to potential host, the susceptibility of the host,
and the virulence properties of the contaminating strain.

395-397

 Thus, data are insufficient to assign a level of risk of disease even on the basis of the number of colony-forming units
detected in samples from the hospital environment. By routinely culturing water samples, many hospitals will have
to be committed to water-decontamination programs to eradicate 

Legionella 

spp. Because of this problem, routine monitoring of water from the hospital's potable water system and from aerosol-producing
devices is not widely recommended.

398

 

The second approach to prevent and control nosocomial legionellosis is by: (a) Maintaining a high index of suspicion
for legionellosis and appropriately using diagnostic tests for legionellosis in patients with nosocomial pneumonia
who are at high risk of developing the disease and dying from the infection,

338,399

 (b) initiating an investigation for a hospital source of 

Legionella

 spp. upon identification of one laboratory-confirmed case of definite or two laboratory-confirmed cases of possible
nosocomial Legionnaires' disease, and (c) routinely maintaining cooling towers and using only sterile water for
filling and terminal rinsing of nebulization devices. 

In hospitals with no identified cases of legionellosis, further study is needed of the cost-benefit ratio of control
measures aimed at creating an environment that is not conducive to survival or multiplication of 

Legionella 

spp., e.g., routine maintenance of potable water at "50
 C or <20
 C at the tap or chlorination of heated water to achieve 1-2 mg/L free residual chlorine at the tap.

338,383,393,400-403

 



B. Prevention of Legionnaires' Disease in Hospitals With Identified Cases (Secondary Prevention) 



The indications for a full-scale environmental investigation to search for and subsequently decontaminate identified
sources of 

Legionella 

spp. in hospital environments remain to be elucidated, and probably vary from hospital to hospital. In institutions
where as few as 1-3 nosocomial cases are identified over a period of up to several months, intensified surveillance
for Legionnaires' disease has frequently detected numerous additional cases.

357,376,380,401 

This suggests the need for a low threshold for initiating an investigation following the identification of nosocomial,
laboratory-confirmed cases of legionellosis. However, when developing a strategy to respond to such an identification,
infection-control personnel should consider the level of risk of nosocomial acquisition of, and mortality from,


Legionella 

spp. infection at their particular hospital. 

An epidemiologic investigation of the source of 

Legionella 

spp. involves several important steps, including retrospective review of microbiologic and medical records, active
surveillance to identify all recent or ongoing cases of legionellosis, identification of risk factors (including
environmental exposures for infection, such as showering or use of respiratory-therapy equipment), collection
of water samples from environmental sources implicated by the epidemiologic investigation and from other potential
sources of aerosolized water, and subtype-matching between legionellae isolated from patients and environmental
samples.

382,404-406 

The latter step can be crucial in supporting epidemiologic evidence of a link between human illness and a specific
source.

<TEXT>
 

In hospitals where the heated-water system has been identified as the source of the organism, the system has been decontaminated
by pulse (one-time) thermal disinfection or superheating (i.e., flushing for at least 5 minutes each distal outlet
of the hot-water system with water at "65
 C) and hyperchlorination (flushing all outlets of the hot-water system with water containing "10 mg/L free
residual chlorine).

403,408-410

 Following either of these procedures, most hospitals maintain heated-water at "50
 C or <20
 C at the tap or chlorinate heated water to achieve 1-2 mg/L free residual chlorine at the tap.

338,383,393,400-403

 Additional measures, such as physical cleaning or replacement of hot-water storage tanks, water-heaters, faucets,
and showerheads, may be required because scale and sediment that provide organisms protection from the biocidal
effects of heat and chlorine, may accumulate in them.

346,403

 Alternative methods for control and eradication of legionellae in water systems, such as treatment of water with
ozone, ultraviolet light, or heavy metal ions, have limited the growth of legionellae under laboratory,

344,411,412

 or, in the case of ultraviolet light, operating conditions.

413

 However, further data are needed regarding the efficacy of these methods when used in hospital water systems

414

 before they can be considered standard. In hospitals where the cooling towers are contaminated, measures for decontamination
have been previously published.

415

 

For highly immunocompromised patients, other preventive measures have been used. At one hospital, immunosuppressed
patients were restricted from taking showers, and, for these patients, only sterile water was used for drinking or
flushing nasogastric tubes;

384

 In another hospital, a combined approach, consisting of continuous heating, particulate filtration, ultraviolet
treatment, and monthly pulse hyperchlorination of the water supply of the bone-marrow transplant unit, was used
to decrease the incidence of Legionnaires' disease.

413

 

In view of the high cost of an environmental investigation and of instituting control measures to eradicate 

Legionella

 spp. from sources in the hospital

416,417

 and the differential risk, based on host factors, for acquiring nosocomial legionellosis and of having severe and
fatal infection with the microorganism, the decision to search for and the choice of procedures to eradicate hospital
environmental sources of 

Legionella

 spp. should take into account the type of patient population served by the hospital. 



ASPERGILLOSIS 



I. Epidemiology 





Aspergillus

 spp. are ubiquitous fungi, commonly occurring in soil, water, and decaying vegetation. 

Aspergillus

 spp. have been cultured from unfiltered air, ventilation systems, contaminated dust dislodged during hospital
renovation and construction, horizontal surfaces, food, and ornamental plants.

418

 



A. fumigatus

 and 

A. flavus

 are the most frequently isolated 

Aspergillus

 spp. in patients with proven aspergillosis.

419

 Nosocomial aspergillosis has been recognized increasingly as a cause of severe illness and mortality in highly immunocompromised
patients, e.g., patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or organ transplantation, including bone-marrow transplantation
for hematologic and other malignant neoplasms.

420-423



The most important nosocomial infection due to 

Aspergillus

 spp. is pneumonia.

424

 Hospital outbreaks of pulmonary aspergillosis have occurred mainly in granulocytopenic patients, especially
in bone-marrow transplant units.

424-430

 Although invasive aspergillosis has been reported in recipients of solid-organ transplants (e.g., heart or kidney),

431-435

 the incidence of 

Aspergillus

 spp. infections in these patients has been lower than in recipients of bone-marrow transplants, probably because
of the recent decrease in the use of corticosteroids and the introduction of cyclosporine.

433,436

 In solid-organ transplant recipients, the efficacy of infection control measures, such as provision of protected
environments and prophylaxis with antifungal agents, in preventing aspergillosis has not been well evaluated.

433,434,437-439

 In one study of heart-transplant recipients, protective isolation of patients alone failed to prevent fungal infections.

440

 

The reported attributable mortality from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has varied, depending on the patient
population studied. Rates have been as high as 95% in recipients of allogeneic bone-marrow transplants and patients
with aplastic anemia, compared with rates of 13-80% in leukemic patients.

441-443





II. Pathogenesis 



In contrast to most bacterial pneumonias, the primary route of acquiring 

Aspergillus

 sp. infection is by inhalation of the fungal spores. In severely immunocompromised patients, primary 

Aspergillus

 spp. pneumonia results from local lung tissue invasion.

419,444,445

 Subsequently, the fungus may disseminate via the bloodstream to involve multiple other deep organs.

419,445,446

 A role for nasopharyngeal colonization with 

Aspergillus

 spp., as an intermediate step before invasive pulmonary disease, has been proposed, but remains to be elucidated.

438,447,448

 On the other hand, colonization of the lower respiratory tract by 

Aspergillus

 spp., especially in patients with preexisting lung disease such as chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis,
or inactive tuberculosis, has predisposed patients to invasive pulmonary and/or disseminated infection.

419,445,449

III. Diagnosis 



Diagnosing pneumonia due to 

Aspergillus

 spp. is often difficult without performing invasive procedures. Bronchoalveolar lavage has been a useful screening
test,

450-452

 but lung biopsy is still considered the most reliable technique.

453

 Histopathologic demonstration of tissue invasion by fungal hyphae has been required in addition to isolation of


Aspergillus

 spp. from respiratory tract secretions because the latter, by itself, may indicate colonization.

454

 However, when 

Aspergillus

 spp. is grown from the sputum of a febrile, granulocytopenic patient with a new pulmonary infiltrate, it is highly
likely that the patient has pulmonary aspergillosis.

447,455

 Routine blood cultures are remarkably insensitive for detecting 

Aspergillus

 spp.,

456

 and systemic antibody responses in immunocompromised patients are likely to be unreliable indicators of infection.

457-459

 Antigen-based serologic assays are now being developed in an attempt to allow for the rapid and specific diagnosis
of 

Aspergillus

 spp. infections; however, their clinical usefulness is presently undefined.

460,461

 



IV. Risk Factors and Control Measures 



The major risk factor for invasive aspergillosis is severe and prolonged granulocytopenia, both disease- and therapy-induced.

462

 Since bone-marrow transplant recipients experience the most severe degree of granulocytopenia, they probably
constitute the population at highest risk of developing invasive aspergillosis.

442,463

 The tendency of bone-marrow transplant recipients to develop severe granulocytopenia (<1,000 polymorphonuclears/ u l)
is associated with the type of graft they receive. While both autologous and allogeneic bone-marrow transplant recipients
are severely granulocytopenic for up to 4 weeks after the transplant procedure, allogeneic-transplant recipients
may, in addition, develop acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. The latter may occur up to several months after
the procedure, and the disease and/or its therapy (often with high doses of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and other
immunosuppressive agents) may result in severe granulocytopenia. Consequently, in developing strategies to prevent
invasive 

Aspergillus

 spp. infection in bone-marrow-transplant patients, infection control personnel should consider exposures of
the patient to the fungus not only during the patient's immediate posttransplantation period, but also other exposures
(e.g., at home or in an ambulatory-care setting) subsequent to the immediate posttransplant period, when the patient
(especially allogeneic-transplant recipients) may again manifest severe granulocytopenia. To help address this
problem, various studies are now in progress to evaluate newer methods of enhancing host resistance to invasive fungal
(and other) infections, and of eliminating or suppressing respiratory fungal colonization of the upper respiratory
tract. These methods include, respectively, the use of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factors and intranasal
application of amphotericin B, or oral or systemic antifungal drug prophylaxis.

418,464-467

 For solid-organ transplant recipients, risk factors for invasive aspergillosis have not been as extensively studied.
In one study of liver-transplant recipients, risk factors for invasive infection with 

Aspergillus

 sp. identified by univariate analysis included preoperative and postoperative receipt of steroids and antimicrobial
agents, and prolonged duration of transplant surgery.

468

 

The presence of aspergilli in the hospital environment is the major extrinsic risk factor for the occurrence of opportunistic
invasive 

Aspergillus

 sp. infection.

437,469

 Environmental disturbances due to construction and/or renovation activities in and around hospitals markedly
raise the airborne 

Aspergillus

 spp. spore counts in such hospitals and have been associated with nosocomial aspergillosis.

426,428,429,470-473

 In addition, aspergillosis in high-risk immunosuppressed patients has been associated with other hospital environmental
reservoirs, including bird droppings in air ducts supplying high-risk patient areas,

474

 and contaminated fireproofing material or damp wood.

428,475


 
A single case of nosocomial 

Aspergillus

 spp. pneumonia is often difficult to link to a specific environmental exposure. However, additional cases may remain
undetected without an active search that includes an intensive retrospective review of microbiologic, histopathologic,
and postmortem records; notification of clinicians caring for high-risk patients; and establishment of a system
for prospective surveillance for additional cases. When additional cases are detected, the likelihood is increased
that a hospital environmental source of 

Aspergillus

 spp. can be identified.

426,428,470-475

 Previous investigations have shown the importance of construction activities and/or fungal ``contamination''
of hospital air-handling systems as major sources for outbreaks.

424,426,428,470-474

 New molecular typing techniques, namely karyotyping

476

 and DNA endonuclease profiling (now available for 

A. fumigatus

),

477

 may significantly aid in identifying the source of an outbreak. 

Outbreaks of invasive aspergillosis reinforce the importance of maintaining an environment as free of 

Aspergillus

 spp. spores as possible for patients with severe granulocytopenia. To achieve this goal, specialized services in
many large hospitals, in particular bone-marrow transplant services, have installed ``protected environments''
for the care of their high-risk, severely granulocytopenic patients, and increased their vigilance during hospital
construction and routine maintenance of hospital air-filtration and ventilation systems, to prevent exposing
high-risk patients to bursts of fungal spores.

426,428,470-474,478-483



While the exact configuration and specifications of the protected environments may vary between hospitals, these
patient-care areas are built to minimize fungal spore counts in air by maintaining (a) high-efficiency filtration
of incoming air as it enters the room (i.e., at point of use) with HEPA filters that are 99.97% efficient in filtering
0.3 u -sized particles, (b) directed room airflow_from intake on one side of the room, across the patient, and out
through the exhaust on the opposite side of the room, (c) positive room-air pressure relative to the corridor, (d)
well-sealed rooms, and (e) high rates of room-air changes (range: 15 to >400 per hour).

424,479-481,483-485

 The oldest and most studied protected environment is a room with laminar airflow, consisting of a bank of HEPA filters
along an entire wall through which air is pumped by blowers into the room at a uniform velocity (30-90 feet/minute),
forcing the air to move in a laminar, or at least unidirectional, pattern.

486

 The air usually exits at the opposite end of the room, and ultra-high (100-400 per hour) air-change rates are
achieved.

424

 The net effects are: essentially sterile air in the room, minimal air turbulence, minimal opportunity for microorganism
build-up, and a consistently clean environment.

424


 
The efficacy of a laminar-airflow system in decreasing or eliminating the risk of nosocomial aspergillosis in high-risk
patients has been demonstrated.

424,479,484,485

 However, such a system is costly to install and maintain.

469

 Less expensive alternative systems with lower air-change rates (10-15 per hour) have been utilized in some
centers.

480,481,487

 However, studies comparing the efficacy of these alternative systems with laminar-airflow rooms in eliminating


Aspergillus

 spp. spores and preventing nosocomial aspergillosis are limited. One institution employing cross-flow ventilation,
point-of-use high-efficiency filters, and 15 air changes per hour reported that cases of nosocomial aspergillosis
in patients housed in these rooms have occurred, albeit at a low rate (3.4%).

481,487

 The infections, however, were due to 

A. flavus

_a species that was never cultured from the room air, suggesting that the patients were probably exposed to fungal
spores when they were allowed outside their rooms.

481

 

Copper-8-quinolinolate has been used on environmental surfaces contaminated with 

Aspergillus

 spp. to control a reported outbreak,

488

 and incorporated in fireproofing material of a newly constructed hospital

481

 to help decrease the environmental spore burden, but its general applicability is yet to be established.

VIRAL PNEUMONIAS 


Viruses can be an important and often unappreciated cause of nosocomial pneumonia.

489,490

 In one prospective study of endemic nosocomial infections, approximately 20% of patients with pneumonia had viral
infections.

490

}

 Although early diagnosis and treatment of viral infections have become possible in recent years,

491-494

 many hospitalized patients remain at high risk for developing severe and sometimes fatal viral infections.

489,495-502 

Based on these data and on well-documented outbreaks with nosocomial viral transmission,

503-506 

 measures to prevent viral transmission should be instituted. 
Nosocomial respiratory viral infections (1) usually follow community outbreaks that occur during a particular
period every year,

505,507-510

 (2) confer only short-term immunity,

511

 (3) affect healthy and ill persons,

497,498,504,512-514

 and (4) have exogenous sources. A number of viruses, including adenoviruses, influenza virus, measles virus, parainfluenza
viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, and varicella-zoster virus can cause nosocomial pneumonia;

498,505,506,515-521

 however, adenoviruses, influenza or parainfluenza viruses, and RSV have been reported to account for most (70%)
of nosocomial pneumonias due to viruses.

522,523


Because influenza and RSV infections account for a substantial portion of morbidity and mortality due to viral pneumonia
and have been well studied epidemiologically, this section focuses on the principles and approaches to control these
infections. However, because the modes of transmission of RSV (i.e., by large droplets or by contact with contaminated
hands or other fomites) are the same as those of parainfluenza viruses and similar to those of adenoviruses and rhinoviruses
(i.e., mainly by large droplets or contact with contaminated hands or other fomites, but also possibly by aerosol
inhalation), infection-control measures recommended for RSV infection are applicable to infections caused by
the other three viruses.

524-529

 Prevention of nosocomial infections due to measles and varicella-zoster is addressed in another document.

213

 



RSV INFECTION 


I. Epidemiology 


RSV infection is most common during infancy and early childhood, but may also occur in adults.

134,512,515,530,531

 Infection usually causes mild or moderately severe upper respiratory illness. However, life-threatening pneumonia
or bronchiolitis has been reported in children with chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, immunocompromised patients,
and the elderly.

497,499,514,515,532,533

 
Recent surveillance of 10 U.S. hospital laboratories performing cultures for RSV suggests that community outbreaks
occur yearly between December and March, last from 3-5 months, and are associated with increased hospitalization
and deaths among infants and young children.

534

 During community outbreaks of RSV, children admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms often serve as reservoirs
for RSV.

503,505

 


II. Diagnosis 


The clinical characteristics of RSV infection, especially in neonates, are often indistinguishable from those
of other viral respiratory tract infections.

515,516

 Culture of RSV from respiratory secretions remains the ``gold standard'' for diagnosis. Although rapid antigen-detection
kits utilizing direct immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are available and can provide results
within hours, the benefit of using these tests to identify infected and susceptible patients depends on the sensitivity
and specificity of the test. The reported sensitivity and specificity of RSV enzyme immunoassays vary between 80%
and 95%, and may even be lower in actual practice.

535-538

 In general, once laboratory-confirmed cases of RSV infection are identified in a hospital, a presumptive diagnosis
of RSV infection in subsequent cases with manifestations suggestive of RSV infection may be acceptable for infection
control purposes.

III. Modes of Transmission 


RSV is present in large numbers in the respiratory secretions of symptomatic persons infected with the virus and can
be transmitted directly via large droplets during close contact with such persons, or indirectly via RSV-contaminated
hands or fomites.

503,524,525

 The portal of entry is usually the conjunctiva or the nasal mucosa.

526

 Inoculation by RSV-contaminated hands is the usual way of depositing the virus onto the eyes or nose.

503,524-526

 Hands can become contaminated through handling of infected persons' respiratory secretions or contaminated fomites.

524,525

 
In nosocomial RSV outbreaks in which the viral isolates were typed, more than one strain of RSV has often been identified,

504,513,539

 suggesting multiple sources of the virus. Potential sources include patients, hospital staff, and visitors. Because
infected infants shed large amounts of virus in their respiratory secretions and easily contaminate their immediate
surroundings, they are a major reservoir for RSV.

540

 Hospital staff may become infected after exposure in the community

541

 or in the hospital, and in turn, infect patients, other health-care workers, or hospital visitors.

516,542

 


IV. Control Measures 


Various combinations of control measures ranging from the simple to the complex have been effective, to some degree
or other, in preventing and controlling nosocomial RSV infection.

215,542-549

 Successful programs have had two elements in common: implementation of contact-isolation precautions, and compliance
with these precautions by healthcare personnel. In theory, strict handwashing should prevent most nosocomial RSV
infections. However, health-care workers' handwashing practices have always been poor, even in institutions with
good educational programs.

210,211

 Thus, other preventive measures are usually relied upon to prevent RSV infection. 
The basic precautions that have been associated with decreased incidence of nosocomial RSV infections are gloving
and gowning.

215

 Gloving has helped decrease transmission probably because gloves remind patient-care personnel to comply with
handwashing and other precautions, and deter persons from touching their eyes or noses. The benefits from gloving,
however, are offset if gloves are not changed between patients or after contact with contaminated fomites, and if
hands are not adequately washed after glove removal.

218

 Gowning, in combination with gloving, during contact with RSV-infected infants or their immediate environment
has been used successfully to prevent infection.

215

 In addition, the use of eye-nose goggles rather than masks has protected healthcare workers from infection; however,
eye-nose goggles are not widely available and are inconvenient to wear.

546,550

 
Additional measures may be indicated to control ongoing nosocomial transmission of RSV or to prevent transmission
to patients at high risk for serious complications of infections, such as those with compromised cardiac, pulmonary,
or immune systems. The following additional control measures have been used in various combinations: (1) Use of private
rooms for infected patients OR cohorting of infected patients, with or without pre-admission screening by rapid
laboratory diagnostic tests, (2) cohorting of personnel, (3) exclusion of healthcare workers who have symptoms
of upper respiratory tract infection from the care of uninfected patients at high risk of severe or fatal RSV infection,
e.g., infants, (4) limiting visitors, and (5) postponing admission of patients at high risk of complications from
RSV infection.

213,543,545,547,549

 Although the exact role of each of these measures has not been fully elucidated, their use for control of outbreaks
seems prudent. 


INFLUENZA 


I. Epidemiology 


Pneumonia in patients with influenza may be due to the influenza virus itself, secondary bacterial infection, or
a combination of both.

551-553

 Influenza-associated pneumonia can occur in any person, but is more common in the very young or old and in persons in
any age group with immunosuppression or certain chronic medical conditions such as severe underlying heart or lung
disease.

531,554-556

 
Influenza typically occurs annually in the winter between December and April; peak activity in a community usually
lasts from 6 to 8 weeks during this period.

557,558

 During influenza epidemics in the community, nosocomial outbreaks may occur and are characterized by abrupt onset
and rapid transmission.

559-561

 Most reported institutional outbreaks of influenza have occurred in nursing homes; however, hospital outbreaks
have been reported on pediatric and chronic-care wards, as well as on medical and neonatal intensive care units.

506,562-565

 
Influenza is believed to be spread from person to person by direct deposition of virus-laden large droplets onto the
mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract of an individual during close contact with an infected person, as
well as by droplet nuclei or small-particle aerosols.

566-569

 The extent to which transmission may occur by virus-contaminated hands or fomites is unknown; however, it is not the
primary mode of spread.

570

 
The most important reservoirs of influenza virus are infected persons, and the period of greatest communicability
is during the first 3 days of illness; however, the virus can be shed before onset of symptoms, and up to 7 or more days
after illness onset.

506,557,571

 


II. Diagnosis 


Influenza is clinically indistinguishable from other febrile respiratory illnesses, but during outbreaks with
laboratory-confirmed cases, a presumptive diagnosis of the infection can be made in cases with similar manifestations.

572

 In the past, diagnosis of influenza was made by virus isolation from nasopharyngeal secretions or by serologic conversion,
but recently developed rapid diagnostic tests that are similar to culture in sensitivity and specificity allow early
diagnosis and treatment of cases and provide a basis for prompt initiation of antiviral prophylaxis as part of outbreak
control.

573-578

III. Prevention and Control Measures 



Vaccination of persons at high risk for complications of influenza is currently the most effective measure for reducing
the impact of influenza, and should be done before the influenza season each year. Such persons include those "65 years
of age; those in long-term-care units; those with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems,
those with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, musculo-skeletal disorders, or immunosuppression;
and children 6 months-18 years of age who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy.

564,579-581

 When high vaccination rates are achieved in closed or semi-closed settings, the risk of outbreaks is reduced because
of induction of herd immunity.

582,583

 

When an institutional outbreak is due to influenza A, antiviral agents may be used both for treatment of ill persons
and as prophylaxis for others.

584

 Two related antiviral agents, amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride, are effective against
influenza-A, but not influenza-B, virus.

493,585-587

 These agents can be used (1) for short-term prophylaxis after late vaccination of high-risk persons; (2) as prophylaxis
for persons for whom vaccination is contraindicated; (3) as prophylaxis for immunocompromised persons who may not
produce protective levels of antibody in response to vaccination; (4) for prophylaxis for unvaccinated healthcare
workers who provide care to high-risk patients, either for the duration of influenza activity in the community or
until immunity develops after vaccination; and (5) when vaccine strains do not closely match the epidemic viral strain.

584

 


Amantadine has been available in the United States for many years; rimantadine has just recently been approved for
use. Both drugs protect against all naturally-occurring strains of type A influenza virus; thus, antigenic changes
in the virus that may reduce vaccine efficacy do not alter the effectiveness of amantadine or rimantadine. Both are
70-90% effective in preventing illness if taken before exposure to influenza A virus.

585,588

 In addition, they lessen the severity and duration of illness due to influenza A when administered within 24-48
hours after onset of symptoms.

589,590

 Amantadine can limit nosocomial spread of influenza A if it is administered to all or most patients at the time influenza
is recognized in a facility.

562,591,592

 

Side effects from amantadine are more common than those from rimantadine; they include mild and transitory nervousness,
insomnia, impaired concentration, mood changes, light-headedness, anorexia, and nausea. These symptoms have
been reported in 5-10% of healthy young adults receiving 200 mg of the drug per day.

493,585

 In the elderly, the symptoms may be more severe; in addition, dizziness and ataxia are more common in this age group.

593,594

 Thus, it is recommended that for persons "65 years of age and/or those who have renal insufficiency, amantadine dosage
should be reduced to >100 mg per day. Further reductions are recommended on the basis of the patient's creatinine
clearance.

595,596

 However, because recommended dosages based on creatinine clearance may provide only a rough estimate of the optimal
dose for a given patient,

597

 such persons should be carefully observed so that adverse reactions can be recognized promptly and the dose further
reduced or the drug discontinued, if necessary. 

Emergence of amantadine- and rimantadine-resistant strains of influenza A virus has been observed in persons who
receive these drugs for treatment of the infection.

598,599

 Because of the potential risk of transmission of resistant viral strains to close contacts of persons receiving amantadine
or rimantadine for treatment,

599,600

 to the extent possible, infected persons taking either drug should avoid contact with others during treatment and
for 2 days after discontinuing treatment.

600,601

 This is particularly important if the contacts are uninfected persons taking amantadine or rimantadine for prophylaxis.

600,602

 

Vaccination of high-risk patients and of hospital personnel before the influenza season is the primary focus of efforts
to prevent and control nosocomial influenza.

581,584,603

 The decision to use amantadine or rimantadine as an adjunct to vaccination in the prevention and control of nosocomial
influenza is based in part on results of virologic and epidemiologic surveillance in the hospital and the community.
When outbreaks of influenza A occur in a hospital, and antiviral prophylaxis of high-risk persons and treatment of
cases is undertaken, administration of amantadine or rimantadine is begun as early in the outbreak as possible to
reduce transmission.

562,584,591,602

 

Measures other than vaccination and chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine have been recommended for
control of nosocomial influenza outbreaks. Because influenza can be transmitted during contact with an infected
person, contact-isolation precautions, such as placing a patient symptomatic with influenza in a private room,
cohorting of patients with influenza, and masking upon entering a room with persons with influenza have been recommended.

213

 Handwashing, gloving, and gowning by healthcare workers during the period of viral shedding by patients have also
been recommended, but the exact role of these measures in preventing influenza transmission remains to be elucidated.

213,561,604

 Although influenza can be transmitted via the airborne route, the efficacy of placing infected persons in rooms with
negative pressure in relation to their immediate environment has not been assessed. In addition, this measure may
be impractical during institutional outbreaks that occur in the midst of a community epidemic of influenza because
many newly admitted patients and healthcare workers may be infected with the virus; thus, the hospital would face
the logistical problem of accommodating all ill persons in rooms with special ventilation. Although controlled
studies are not available to measure their effectiveness, the following additional measures have been recommended
for consideration, particularly during severe outbreaks: (1) Curtailment or elimination of elective admissions,
both medical and surgical; (2) restriction of cardiovascular and pulmonary surgery; (3) restriction of hospital
visitors, especially those with acute respiratory illnesses; and (4) work restriction for healthcare workers with
acute respiratory illness.

PART II. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF NOSOCOMIAL PNEUMONIA 



Introduction 



The recommendations are presented according to the etiology of the infection, in the following order: bacterial
pneumonia, including Legionnaires' disease; fungal pneumonia (aspergillosis); and virus-associated pneumonia
(RSV and influenza infections). Each topic is subdivided according to the following general approaches for nosocomial
infection control, as applicable to the infection: 

1. Staff education and infection surveillance; 

2. Interruption of transmission of microorganisms by eradicating infecting; microorganisms from their epidemiologically
important reservoirs, and/or preventing person-to-person transmission; and

3. Modifying host risk for infection. 

As in previous CDC guidelines, each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing scientific evidence,
theoretical rationale, applicability, and economic impact.

213,214,605-609

 However, the previous CDC system of categorizing recommendations has been modified as follows: 



CATEGORY IA

_Strongly recommended for all hospitals and strongly supported by well-designed experimental or epidemiologic
studies. 



CATEGORY IB

_ Strongly recommended for all hospitals and viewed as effective by experts in the field and a consensus of HICPAC based
on strong rationale and suggestive evidence, even though definitive scientific studies may not have been done. 



CATEGORY II

_Suggested for implementation in many hospitals. Recommendations may be supported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic
studies, a strong theoretical rationale, or definitive studies applicable to some but not all hospitals.

Appendix B_Maintenance Procedures to Decrease Survival and Multiplication 
of Legionella SPP. In Potable-Water Distribution Systems 



I. Providing water at "50
 C at all points in the heated water system, 
including the taps




This requires that water in calorifiers (water heaters) be maintained at "60
 C. In the United Kingdom, where maintenance of water temperatures at "50
 C in hospitals has been mandated, installation of blending or mixing valves at or near taps to reduce the water
temperature to >43
 C has been recommended in certain settings to reduce the risk of scald injury to patients, visitors, and health
care workers.

400

 However, 

Legionella

 spp. can multiply even in short segments of pipe containing water at this temperature. Increasing the flow rate from
the hot-water-circulation system may help lessen the likelihood of water stagnation and cooling.

403,676

 Insulation of plumbing to ensure delivery of cold (<20
 C) water to water heaters (and to cold-water outlets) may diminish the opportunity for bacterial multiplication.345
``Dead legs'' or capped spurs within the plumbing system provide areas of stagnation and cooling to <50
 C regardless of the circulating-water temperature; these segments may need to be removed to prevent colonization.

677

 Rubber fittings within plumbing systems have been associated with persistent colonization, and replacement of
these fittings may be required for 

Legionella

 spp. eradication.

678



 


II. Continuous chlorination that maintains concentrations of free residual chlorine at 1-2 mg/L at the tap




This requires flow-adjusted, continuous injectors of chlorine throughout the water distribution system. Adverse
effects of continuous chlorination include accelerated corrosion of plumbing resulting in system leaks and production
of potentially carcinogenic trihalomethanes. However, when levels of free residual chlorine are below 3 mg/L, trihalomethane
levels are kept below the maximum ``safety level'' recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency.

401,679,680

 



Appendix C_Culturing Environmental Specimens for Legionella SPP 



I. Recommended procedure for collecting and processing environmental specimens for 

Legionella

 spp.




A. Collect water (if possible, one-liter samples) in sterile, screw-top bottles, preferably containing sodium
thiosulfate at a concentration of 0.5 cc of 0.1N solution/liter of sample water. (Sodium thiosulfate inactivates
any residual halogen biocide). 

B. Collect culture-swabs of the internal surfaces of faucets, aerators, and showerheads; in a sterile, screw-top
container such as a 50 cc plastic centrifuge tube, submerge each swab in 5-10 cc of sample water taken from the
same device from which the sample was obtained. 

C. As soon as possible after collection, water samples and swabs should be transported to and processed in a laboratory
proficient at culturing water specimens for 

Legionella

 spp. Samples may be transported at room temperature but must be protected from temperature extremes. 

D. Test samples for the presence of 

Legionella

 spp. by culture onto semi-selective media. Use standard laboratory procedures. (Detection of 

Legionella

 spp. antigen by the direct fluorescent antibody technique is not suitable for environmental samples.

681-683

 In addition, the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification of 

Legionella

 spp. is not recommended until more data on the sensitivity and specificity of this procedure are available.

Appendix D_Procedure for Cleaning Cooling Towers and Related Equipment
 


(Adapted from the Emergency Protocol in 

Control of Legionella spp. in Cooling Towers: Summary Guidelines.

415

)



I. Preparatory to Chemical Disinfection and Mechanical Cleaning 



A. Provide protective equipment to workers who would perform the disinfection, to prevent their exposure to a) chemicals
used for disinfection, and b) aerosolized water containing 

Legionella

 spp. Protective equipment may include full-length protective clothing, boots, gloves, goggles, and a full- or half-face
mask that combines high efficiency particulate air filter and chemical cartridges to protect against airborne chlorine
levels of up to 10 mg/L. 

B. Shut off cooling-tower. 



1. If possible, shut off heat source. 

2. Shut off fans, if present, on the cooling tower/evaporative condenser (CT/EC). 

3. Shut off the system blowdown (purge) valve. Shut off automated blowdown controller, if present, and set system
controller to manual. 

4. Keep make-up water valves open. 

5. Close building air-intake vents within at least 30 meters of the CT/EC until after the cleaning procedure is complete.


6. Continue operating pumps for water circulation through the CT/EC. 



II. Chemical Disinfection 



A. Add fast-release, chlorine-containing disinfectant in pellet, granular, or liquid form, and follow instructions
on the product label. Examples of disinfectants are sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) or calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl)

2

, calculated to achieve initial FRC of 50 mg/L, i.e., 3.0 lbs (1.4 kg) industrial grade NaOCl (12-15% available
Cl) per 1,000 gallons of CT/EC water; 10.5 lbs (4.8 kg) domestic grade NaOCl (3-5% available Cl) per 1,000 gallons
of CT/EC water; or 0.6 lb (0.3 kg) Ca(OCl)

2

 per 1,000 gallons of CT/EC water. (Other appropriate compounds may be suggested by a water-treatment specialist.)
If significant biodeposits are present, add more chlorine. If the water volume in CT/EC is unknown, estimate it (in
gallons) to be 10x the recirculation rate in gallons/minute or 30x the refrigeration capacity in tons. 

B. Record type and quality of all chemicals used for disinfection, exact time when chemicals are added to the system,
and time and results of measurements of free residual chlorine (FRC) and pH. 

C. Within 15 minutes of adding disinfectant, add the dispersant by first dissolving it in water and adding the resulting
solution to a turbulent zone in the water system. Examples of low or non-foaming, silicate-based dispersants are:
automatic-dishwasher compounds, such as Cascade* or Calgonite* or an equivalent product. (Dispersants are added
at 10-25 lbs. (4.5-11.25 kg) per 1,000 gallons of CT/EC water.)

 


*Use of product names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or the

D. After adding disinfectant and dispersant, continue circulating the water through the system. Monitor FRC with
an FRC-measuring device, e.g., a swimming pool test kit, and measure pH with a pH meter every 15 minutes for 2 hours.
Add chlorine as needed to maintain FRC at "10 mg/L. Adjust pH to 7.5-8.0. The pH may be lowered by using any acid
(e.g., muriatic acid or sulfuric acid used for maintenance of swimming pools) that is compatible with treatment chemicals.


E. Two hours after adding disinfectant and dispersant or after FRC level is stable at "10 mg/L, monitor at 2-hour intervals
and maintain FRC at "10 mg/L for 24 hours. 

F. After FRC level is maintained at "10 mg/L for 24 hours, drain the system. CT/EC water may be drained to the sanitary
sewer. Municipal water and sewerage authorities should be contacted regarding local regulations. If a sanitary
sewer is not available, consult local or state authorities (e.g. Department of Natural Resources) regarding disposal
of water. If necessary, drain-off may be dechlorinated by dissipation or chemical neutralization (i.e. with sodium
bisulfite). 

G. Refill system with water and repeat procedure outlined in steps 2-6. 



III. Mechanical Cleaning 



A. After water from the second chemical disinfection has been drained, shut down the CT/EC. 

B. Inspect all water contact areas for sediment, sludge, and scale. Using brushes and/or a low-pressure water hose,
thoroughly clean all CT/EC water contact areas including basin, sump, fill, spray nozzles, and fittings. Replace
components as needed. 

C. If possible, clean CT/EC water contact areas within the chillers. 



IV. After Mechanical Cleaning 



A. Fill system with water, and add chlorine to achieve FRC level of 10 mg/L. 

B. Circulate water for one hour, then open blowdown valve and flush the entire system until it is free of turbidity.


C. Drain system. 

D. Open any air intake vents that were closed prior to cleaning. 

E. Fill system with water. CT/EC may be put back into service using an effective water-treatment program.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corporation for National and Community Service announces the availability of up to $3 million for grants to support
the Summer of Safety, an AmeriCorps project, that will focus on enhancing public safety. These funds must be matched
with non-Corporation funds, and will provide opportunities for more than 1000 Americans, especially young people,
to serve full time in community-based collaborative efforts to respond to the problems of crime, violence and fear.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Background



On September 21, 1993, the President signed into law the National and Community Service Trust Act (the Act), which
created the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of
all ages and backgrounds in service that addresses the nation's educational, public safety, health, and environmental
needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility,
strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide educational opportunity for those who make a substantial
commitment to service.
The Corporation is a new federal agency that encompasses the work and staff of two existing independent agencies,
the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative
called AmeriCorps, service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher
education called Learn and Serve America, and the new National Civilian Community Corps, and also engage in efforts
to improve the quality of service programs. In addition, the Corporation will continue to support the Volunteers
In Service To America (VISTA) program and the senior volunteer programs previously sponsored by ACTION.
The Act authorizes the Corporation to support summer service programs directly (such as the Summer of Safety) and
indirectly, in conjunction with the States. Programs that operate during the summer offer an excellent opportunity
to experiment with new approaches to solving community problems and to bring new resources and participants into
community service efforts.


Program Objectives


``Summer of Safety,'' the Corporation's 1994 summer service program, is being launched to respond to the growing
fear of and frustration over the levels of crime and violence in every part of the country. The 1994 Summer of Safety
will demonstrate the potential of national service to respond to these urgent needs by unleashing the talents and
energies of Americans of all ages and backgrounds, especially young adults. Summer of Safety will specifically address
the public safety needs of communities by achieving the following objectives:



_Make direct and demonstrable impacts on crime, violence and fear by identifying and meeting public safety needs;
_Build new partnerships and collaborations for safety that capitalize on all of the community's resources;
_Demonstrate that every citizen_especially young people_can help make communities safer;
_Provide seed support for innovative service programs that address public safety needs; and 
_Stimulate public interest in national service as a means to respond to America's problems.



Program Overview


The Corporation will directly fund Summer of Safety programs in up to 20 locations, both urban and rural, for the summer
months. Summer of Safety programs will be run by partnerships that may include law enforcement, other public agencies,
non-profit and community-based organizations, institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and the business
community.


Participants will engage in service activities directly related to enhancing public safety. Permissible program
activities may range from assisting police officers in community policing initiatives, to escorting seniors in
high-crime neighborhoods, to working in victim assistance programs, to supervising recreation activities for
children and youth that incorporate safety and violence prevention education. A program may establish terms of participants
to carry out a range of different public safety-related activities during the summer, or place participants individually
or in small groups in core assignments for the whole summer.


Participants will be selected by local programs, and they must receive training appropriate to their service assignments.
Participants will receive living allowances of at least $147.00 per week during their service, and, upon successful
completion of the program (and a minimum of 381 hours of service), a postservice benefit of $1000 which may be used for
support of higher education programs, certain vocational training and school-to-work programs, or repayment of
student loans.

In addition to the programs supported under this grant competition, the Corporation is sponsoring other Summer of
Safety initiatives. These are briefly described in Appendix 2.



Eligibility




Public agencies (including law enforcement agencies, local units of government, health/social service agencies,
etc.), nonprofit organizations (including youth-servin groups, community based organizations, service organizations,
etc.), institutions of higher education, and Indian tribes are eligible to apply. State agencies that intend to operate
the program directly are also eligible.


While a single entity may be the actual recipient of the grant thereby responsible for financial administration and
program management we expect that the Summer of safety programs will be conducted by working partnerships among any
or all of the above types of organizations.



Special Funding Requirements




Summer of Safety grants may be made from one of three sources of funds: Subtitle H of the Act (Investment for Quality
and Innovation), Subtitle B-2 of the Act (Learn and Serve America: Higher Education) and Subtitle C of the Act
(AmeriCorps Grants). Applicants should specify which type of funding they are seeking. While Subtitle H carries
no restrictions, Subtitles B-2 and C contain the following:


Subtitle B-2 requires, among other things, that an applicant be an institution of higher education (or a consortium
of such institutions), or a partnership of public or private nonprofit organizations and one or more institutions
of higher education. Programs must involve, but are not limited to, current students. Pursuant to the Act, priority
will be given to applications that meet certain characteristics, as detailed in Appendix 3.


The Corporation will ensure that at least 50% of the funds awarded under Subtitle C will support projects that will
be conducted in areas of need, as detailed in Appendix 4.


Beyond the requirements specific to the Subtitles from which the funding originates, applicants must meet all other
requirements in this notice, regardless of the type of funds being requested. Proposals that do not indicate a preferred
type of funding will be reviewed as the Corporation deems appropriate. Each of the two types of funds require a non-Corporation
match of at least 25% of program costs. The Corporation has the flexibility to ensure that the highest quality proposals
are funded, regardless of whether they are submitted under Subtitle B2 or Subtitle C.



Content of Proposal




Summer of Safety applicants should submit program proposals that contain the sections noted below and meet the requirements
in this notice. Should you desire further guidance on the format of your proposal, you should contact the Corporation
at 202/606-4949.



1. Title Page




List: (1) Name and address of legal applicant (and include the signature of the authorized executive); (2) names of
organizations participating in partnership; (3) amount of Federal funds requested, amount of non-federal match
(both cash and in-kind); (4) number of stipended participants and number of additional volunteers who will not receive
a stipend; and (5) one paragraph describing program activities and target community.



2. Program Narrative




A narrative describing the proposed program should contain sections that respond to the following requirements:



(a) Community Need/Anticipated Impact




The paramount goal of Summer of Safety is to address problems of crime, violence and fear in the communities where programs
are conducted. To have such an impact, problems must be identified and defined and strategies developed which have
specific objectives. Accordingly, successful proposals will:


(i) Discuss the specific needs or problems that exist in the target community/neighborhood(s) which the project
will address. Sources of official data (demographic data, crime offense data, etc.), public opinion surveys, expert
analysis, and other sources of local information are all useful.


(ii) Describe specifically how the program will address the identified problem(s). Outcomes must be direct and demonstrable.


While the goal of every project should be the reduction of crime, violence and fear, it may be very difficult to document
such accomplishments, given the limited time during which a summer program can operate. Accordingly, as well as quantifiable
measures of outcome, there may also be intermediate measures of effort and accomplishment which are appropriate
as specific objectives.


Examples of such objectives each of which should address only one activity and include one result may include reduction
in reported crime of XX% (generally, or in more limited focus, i.e., robberies of convenience stores, gang-related
assaults, attacks against senior citizens, etc.), XX% of neighborhood residents feel safer compared to before program,
XX victims of violent crime assisted at court or at home, XX Safe Houses established, XX playgrounds refurbished and
supervised, XX ``crack houses'' rehabilitated, XX youth provided crime prevention/violence reduction training,
etc.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-2-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) Discuss the appropriateness of a summer program to address the identified needs/problems and to achieve the
specified objectives. This should include discussion of long-term effects (i.e., safe houses established during
the summer will continue to operate during the school year; vacant lots or abandoned playgrounds will be restored
to community use; neighborhood volunteers will continue activities initiated during the summer; etc.)



(b) Participants



Programs must provide quality service opportunities and living allowances (stipends) for between 20 and 150 Summer
of Safety participants. The $1000 post-service benefit, which may be used only for higher educational purposes,
including loan repayment, or certain types of vocational training, will be administered by the Corporation through
the National Service Trust Fund.

Participants must be at least 17 years old, and demonstrate leadership potential. Programs should seek to enroll
participants from diverse racial, economic, and educational backgrounds (including entering and current college
students, recent graduates, and youth not attending college), and include residents from the community where the
program will be conducted. Participant selection decisions are made solely by the program.

Programs should be willing to enroll participants from other parts of the country not simply from the host community.
Grant funds may be used for transportation costs for eligible participants. The Corporation may provide names and
addresses of potential participants to programs. In addition, programs may be contacted by potential participants
who are recruited nationally.

The physical safety of participants must be of paramount concern, and programs that do not take appropriate measures
to protect the safety of participants will not be approved. (See Section 2c, Service Activities, for further information).

Accordingly, proposals must include:

(i) A description of plans to recruit, screen, select, and assign a qualified and diverse pool of participants, including
individuals from the community served, to carry out the agreed-upon service activities;

(ii) A description of the training that will be provided to participants to ensure successful involvement in the summer
program;

(iii) A discussion of how the entire summer experience for participants orientation, training, service activity,
etc._will develop useful skills, teach them about public safety, promote active citizenship, and strengthen their
commitment to service;

(iv) A description of policies and practices designed to assure the safety of participants while carrying out service
activities;

(v) A description of plans to provide appropriate child care for certain program participants. Preliminary guidance
may be found in the Corporation's proposed regulations (See Appendix 5);

These plans may be revised prior to final grant approval, as a result of requirements in these areas that will be set
forth in the Corporation's final regulations;

(vi) A description of arrangements that will be made to provide appropriate program and participant liability coverage;
and

(vii) A description of arrangements that will be made to cover on-the-job injuries to participants, such as linkage
with the State Workers' Compensation Program or other appropriate accident and injury policies.



(c) Service Activities



Summer of Safety projects must have the clear purpose of strengthening the ability of the community to respond to problems
of crime, violence and fear through service. Projects must include at least 8 weeks and 381 hours of full-time service
activity for participants, including the period of orientation and training.

The ideal Summer of Safety service program will develop a range of service activities that depends on the community's
needs and the resources the various members of the partnership bring to the overall initiative. For example, some
activities may involve direct work with police officers or community groups to solve specific crime problems; others
may involve work with victim assistance programs, including efforts to help special groups such as victims of family
violence or seniors. Still others might involve providing training in crime prevention or conflict resolution to
parents and children. An approach to developing a program and examples of possible service activities may be found
in Appendix 1. 

Participants will be assigned to specific service activities determined by the program based on the needs identified
within the community and the skill level of participants. Teams of participants can readily be trained and assigned
to take on a number of distinct activities as part of a broad community effort. Individual assignments to appropriate
activities are also acceptable. Appropriate training and effective supervision of participant service activity
are important to project success.

Accordingly, successful proposals will:

(i) Describe the specific service activities that will be conducted by the program during the summer;

(ii) Identify the number of stipended participants and unstipended volunteers who will serve in each of the identified
activities;

(iii) Discuss the background, skills or other factors related to assigning participants to the various service activities;

(iv) Describe the specific training which will be necessary to enable participants to carry out respective service
assignments;

<DOCNO> FR940202-2-00150 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(v) Describe procedures for the supervision of participants engaged in the service activities; and
(vi) Discuss the process by which the program will ensure that service participants will not displace paid workers,
including considerations with appropriate labor unions.


Limitations


There are activities that are not appropriate for Summer of Safety participants. Concern for the physical safety
of participants and the specialized training/skill requirements for certain law enforcement/corrections tasks
limit the types of service activities which are appropriate. Certain other activities are not appropriate absent
a clear link to a broad community public safety effort. Finally, some tasks are not suitable for national service programs
at all. Specifically:




_The Corporation will not support programs that place service participants in situations that: (1) Involve the arrest
process, (2) involve the chain of custody of evidence, (3) involve witnessing criminal incidents which may result
in participants being called as witnesses in adjudicatory proceedings, (4) result in intentional contact with suspected
criminal offenders, (5) involve contact with defendants or convicted offenders unless appropriate safeguards
are in place, or (6) otherwise pose significant risk to participant safety (e.g., working alone in a high-crime neighborhood,
etc.).
_Although the Corporation recognizes the importance of such activities and their indirect connection to public
safety in the long-term, Summer of Safety grant funds may not be used to support programs which provide positive activities
for youth (i.e., recreation, field trips, cultural opportunities, social/athletic events, vocational support,
academic assistance, mentoring, etc.) unless they are conducted as components of specific public safety initiatives.
The program, when taken as a whole, must have a clear, consistent, and visible public safety purpose and target specific
crime/violence/fear reduction outcomes.
_Activities that do not provide a direct benefit to the community, such as clerical work or research, may be performed
if they support direct service, but may not be the primary activity of a national service program.
_Certain activities are prohibited for participants in all national service programs. These activities include:
efforts to influence legislation; organizing protests; petitions; boycotts or strikes; assisting or deterring
union organizing; impairing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements; partisan political activity;
religious instruction; or benefitting profit-making businesses, labor unions, partisan political organizations,
or non-profit organizations which fail to comply with section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further information
about these prohibited activities may be found in the Corporation's Proposed Program Regulations, published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 7, 1994.


(d) Continuation


While demonstrable impact should be evidenced during the summer, it is not likely that problems will be solved during
an 8-10 week period. In addition, efforts with a longer-term horizon, such as the development of plans for action
beyond the scope of the summer effort, may also begin during the summer. It is important to ensure that promising community-based
activities are not lost at the end of the summer.
Unless a program will achieve its intended impact in the summer only or its impact will be long-term with no further
program effort, the continuation of priority program activity should be addressed in the proposal. Among the possibilities
for continuation which should be considered are:



_The SOS program is able to institutionalize the conduct of critical service activities with existing resources.
_A combination of local, state and private funds are found which permit the continuation of service and volunteer
activities.
_The SOS program partnership may establish (or expand) an effective volunteer cadre to continue its efforts.



Accordingly, proposals must include plans that:
(i) Identify priority activities or strategies which will be sustained following the summer. This may be the entire
program, select components, or efforts begun in the summer that will be brought to fruition.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940202-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940202-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 
 


(ii) Describe the resources and approaches that will assure continuation of the program activity. 
 
Programs that will accomplish their objectives by the end of the summer or those that have no need to sustain activity
because impact will occur in the long-term as a result of the summer effort need not respond to this section of the Notice.

 


(e) Workplan/Timeline 
 


Successful applicants will receive notice of tentative selection by April 1 (see Section 6, Selection and Approval
Process). Accordingly, proposals must include a timeline that: 
 
(i) Identifies specific steps and milestones in a program development, implementation and management process that
begins April 1 and extends through the end of the summer program; 
 
(ii) Incorporates a required national-scope training and technical assistance workshop for Summer of Safety program
leadership (program director and two key supervisory staff) in later April; and 
 
(iii) Absent compelling reason to do otherwise, establishes the week of June 13 for participant orientation and training,
uses June 21 as the official date to ``launch'' their efforts, and sets the program's end at August 24. 
 


(f) Applicant Capacity 
 


The capacity of the applicant to implement and manage the program successfully and the quality of program leadership
are of critical importance in the selection process. Accordingly, proposals must: 
 
(i) Describe the applicant's institutional capacity to develop and administer the program, including payment of
living allowances of at least $147.00 per week of full-time (40 hours) service to participants and management of the
partnership (described below). 
 
(ii) Include brief resumes or other descriptions of experience and background of proposed program director and key
supervisory personnel. 
 
(iii) Describe the working relationships that exist with appropriate community organizations and public agencies.

 
(iv) Describe and document the nature and quality of the relationship with the local law enforcement agency(s) (if
the applicant is not a law enforcement agency). 
 
(v) Review the applicant's experience in conducting public safety and/or community service/volunteer programs.

 
(vi) Certify the applicant's willingness to promote a national identity for the Summer of Safety program, as part
of AmeriCorps, through the use of logos and other materials, and participate in activities such as common opening
or closing ceremonies and other events. 
 


(g) Partnership 
 


Summer of Safety programs will build and strengthen new partnerships and collaborations for safety that capitalize
on all of the community's resources. Given the range of needs that must be met and the variety of possible service activities
that may help meet these needs, there are many organizations, institutions and individuals within the community
that can meaningfully contribute.
 
Such entities include law enforcement, schools and other public agencies, private non-profit organizations including
victim assistance and youth-serving organizations, community and neighborhood groups, health and welfare programs,
senior centers, civic organizations, youth groups, institutions of higher education, and the business sector.
Individuals who represent segments of the community not otherwise represented in the partnership should also be
included. 
 
To ensure that a program establishes service activities that strengthen the capacity of the community to respond
to problems of crime, violence and fear, Summer of Safety programs must be carried out by collaborative partnerships
of such organizations. Accordingly, proposals must: 
 
(i) Identify the organizations and agencies (and, as appropriate, individuals) who have committed to participating
in the Partnership effort, and identify the leader of the Partnership; 
 
(ii) Describe the commitment each partner has made to carry out specific roles and contribute specific resources
(training, expertise, space, supplies, funds, publicity, etc.) to support the Summer of Safety program. 
 
(iii) Identify the number of service participants and type(s) of service activity individual partners propose to
carry out as components of the program.

(h) Monitoring and Evaluation 



Programs must track progress toward achievement of their program objectives. Programs must also monitor the quality
of service activities, the satisfaction of both persons served and program participants, and management effectiveness.
Internal evaluation and monitoring should be a continuous process, allowing for frequent feedback and quick correction
of weaknesses. 

Additionally, programs must cooperate with the Corporation and its evaluators in all Corporation monitoring and
evaluation efforts. As part of this effort, programs must collect and submit to the Corporation certain participant
data, including the total number of participants in the program, and the number of participants by race, ethnicity,

Proposals that meet the minimum requirements outlined above will be reviewed by panels that include experts from
the fields of public safety and service. Publication of this announcement does not obligate the Corporation to award
any specific number of grants or obligate the entire amount of funds available.


Additional factors that may be taken into account in the selection process include population density, geographic
distribution of programs, and diversity among participants and program strategies.


Notification of tentative selection will be made by April 1, 1994. Selections will be considered tentative until
execution of a final grant agreement, which may require discussions between Corporation and program staff to resolve
remaining financial or programmatic issues and to refine and/or further develop plans or specific strategies.


In addition, the Corporation anticipates providing extensive technical assistance to successful applicants between
the time of selection through the launch of project service activity, and throughout the summer. This assistance
will include a mandatory 3 day training/technical assistance workshop to be conducted for all Summer of Safety program
directors and key staff in late April.



Appendix 1




This Appendix provides suggestions for how you might approach the development of a Summer of Safety program. It is
meant to be thought-provoking and is not a required process.



I. Identify the Crime/Violence Problem To Be Addressed




By working directly with local law enforcement, canvassing door-to-door in neighborhoods, attending community
meetings, setting up meetings for law enforcement with community groups, contacting and surveying local businesses,
public agencies, service organizations, youth groups, senior groups, etc., your organization can identify specific
crime problems which confront the community and concern residents. The types of issues most readily identified through
this kind of analysis include:






_Specific population needs (e.g., seniors who are afraid to go to the market after dark, or children who can't use a
playground because of drug activity, debris or disrepair, or teenagers who get in trouble when a facility_theater,
club, etc._closes for the evening, or targets of hate crimes);


_Physical hazards (e.g., drug houses, vacant structures used for drug trade or other illegal or disorderly purpose,
abandoned vehicles, missing street lights, broken fences, dangerous vehicle traffic patterns, open-air drug markets);


_Resident safety concerns (e.g., fear of crime and victimization, need for crime prevention information_locks,
etc., lack of information about crime within neighborhood); and


_Unreported or undetected criminal activity (e.g., drug use or sales in a neighborhood location, gang activity,
prostitution, victims of crime who have not reported the victimization or who continue to be victimized_especially
victims of domestic violence or fraudulent solicitors/practices).



II. Pick The Partners




Think broadly about the range of organizations that are already involved in reducing crime and violence in your community,
or that may be interested in joining such an effort. Try to determine which ones have missions, resources or experience
comparable to yours. City agencies, especially local law enforcement agencies, should be considered. Other possible
partners include:





_Schools (including higher education institutions).


_Private non-profit organizations (particularly those that work to prevent crime and violence or that work with
youth or victims of crime).


_Community and neighborhood organizations.


_Senior or neighborhood centers.


_Private businesses.





Please read Program Narrative section 2(g) (``Partnership'') carefully regarding the delineation of roles and
other aspects of creating a useful partnership. Keep in mind that, while effective partnerships will involve many
elements in a community, eligibility to receive funds and parameters of allowable activities are limited. (See sections
entitled, ``Eligibility'' and ``Limitations''.)



III. Craft a Specific Problem Response




After analyzing the community's needs and picking your partners, you will plan and implement a specific program designed
to make a direct and demonstrable difference.

<TEXT>
 

It may help to have various activities linked with a common theme. For example, in a victims' assistance program, participants
might be engaged in the following activities:




_Supporting victim services within the court, notify victims of court dates and procedures, meet and accompany victims
to courtrooms, staff child care centers, follow-up on restitution orders, etc.;

_Accompanying law enforcement on calls to provide immediate crisis intervention support, accompany victims to
hospital or police department, make social services referrals (including to battered women's shelters), arrange
lock/home repairs, assist with emergency funds, lost documents, public assistance, etc.;

_Maintaining follow-up contact with victims to help identify longer-term needs; and

_Assisting in operation of a victim service program; i.e., work in a family violence shelter providing child care,
tutoring, transportation, vocational help; serve with a sexual assault crisis center/hotline or abused children's
center.




It is also possible that, within a Summer of Safety Program, there may be a number of different service activities which
can positively impact the safety of the community. But make sure that the activities you are contemplating are realistic.
Will they make a real difference in your communities within the short time frame of the summer? Clearly, not every problem
can be solved in one summer, but appropriate responses can be developed that identify the parties responsible for
necessary actions, specify and take initial steps, and evidence impact.

While the range of possible effective activities is potentially limitless, below are additional examples of activities
that can be started and have appreciable impact in a short time:




_Involving neighborhood youth in a senior escort service;

_Conducting and disseminating crime prevention surveys and information/advice;

_Undertaking community clean-up efforts, focusing on graffiti, vacant lots, alleys, and other sites where fear
of crime and disorder are evident;

_Identifying and boarding-up abandoned properties in which drug use/trade may be occurring;

_Organizing neighborhood watch-type programs;

_Initiating or enhancing relationships between law enforcement and local youth organizations;

_Developing a network of ``Safe Houses'' or ``Safe Corridors'' in neighborhood, and training parents and children
about the program;

_Developing and conducting anti-violence presentations for youth groups;

_Joining with senior volunteers in intergenerational efforts designed around youth safety themes;

_Developing and supervising youth activities that incorporate age-appropriate personal safety/violence prevention
training; e.g., illicit drug use, impaired driving, etc.;

_Establishing conflict resolution programs, including outreach, training, and ongoing activities for youth through
schools and community-based youth organizations; and

_Leading public safety-related field trips for youth, with appropriate orientation; e.g., to jails/prisons, police
stations, courts, hospitals, family violence shelters, etc.

VISTA Summer Associate activities will address the issues of crime, violence, and fear in low-income communities
by working on efforts such as community policing, crime prevention, and victim assistance. Both new and existing
VISTA-sponsoring organizations are eligible to apply for VISTA Summer Associates through ACTION State Offices
which will provide technical assistance in developing project applications. 
 
Youth Corps_the Corporation will award grants to operate 10-12 week summer youth corps programs for 1000 youth,
ages 16 to 25. Participants will receive a living allowance, and those who successfully complete the program become
eligible to receive a $1,000 educational award from the National Service Trust. Service activities during the summer
will focus on the areas of public safety and the environment. At least one-half of the available funds will support
public safety-related service activities. In selecting programs, the Corporation will give preference to programs
that are creatively designed to address both public safety and environmental needs. The Corporation expects to award
between 10 and 20 grants ranging in size from $50,000 to $250,000. 
 


Learn and Serve America 
 


Summer of Safety grants of up to $50,000 will be made through the Corporation's Learn & Serve America Program to
engage 1500 youth between the ages of five and seventeen in innovative public safety-related community service.
Eligible applicants are public or private nonprofit organizations that have experience working with school-age
youths, and that have been in existence for at least one year. K-12 Summer of Safety programs must be innovative,
and may encompass multiple program sites. 
 


National Senior Volunteer Corps 
 


The National Senior Volunteer Corps will fund 20 grants to existing NSVC sponsors involving the full range of public
safety activities. An estimated 2,800 Senior Corp members will be recruited. The Corps will include professionally
trained and other seniors interested in serving public safety needs. There will be a targeted recruitment campaign
to attract highly skilled senior or retired police officers, sheriff's deputies, correctional officers, military
police, social workers, teachers, public defenders and community leaders. 
 
Activities may include: Providing administrative support to police departments, conducting neighborhood crime
surveys, providing crime prevention education to seniors, assisting domestic violence victims navigate the court
system, coordinating neighborhood watch programs, and serving as mentors, tutors and counselors to juveniles under
court supervision. 
 
Guidance to existing sponsors will be issued in late January with projects becoming operational in June. 
 


National Civilian Community Corps 
 


Approximately 200 Corps members, aged 14-17, will do public safety-related service projects with schools,
local law enforcement agencies, and community-based organizations. Corps members will receive leadership training
and a mix of the best military and civilian youth service programming during their eight weeks at the camp on an underutilized
military installation. The site for the NCCC Summer of Safety camp will be selected by March, 1994. 
 


Appendix 3 
 


The Act requires that, for funding under Subtitle B-2, priority will be given to applications that: 
 
(1) Demonstrate the commitment of the institution of higher education, other than by demonstrating the commitment
of its students, to supporting the community service projects carried out under the program. 
 
(2) Specify how the institution will promote faculty, administration, and staff participation in the community
service projects. 
 
(3) Specify the manner in which the institution will provide service to the community through organized programs,
including, where appropriate, clinical programs for students in professional schools. 
 
(4) Describe any partnership that will participate in the community service projects, such as a partnership comprised
of the institution, a student organization, a community-based agency, a local government agency, or a nonprofit
entity that serves or involves school-age youth or older adults. 
 
(5) Demonstrate community involvement in the development of the proposal.

(6) Specify that the institution will use funds under this part to strengthen the infrastructure in institutions
of higher education.

(7) With respect to projects involving delivery of service, specify projects that involve leadership development
of school-age youth.



Appendix 4



The Act requires that, in selecting projects for funding under Subtitle C, the Corporation consider whether the project
would be conducted in areas of need, which are:

(1) Communities designated by the Federal government or States as empowerment zones or redevelopment areas, targeted
for special economic incentives, or otherwise identifiable as having high concentrations of low-income people.

(2) Areas that are environmentally distressed.

(3) Areas adversely affected by Federal actions related to the management of Federal lands that result in significant
regional job losses and economic dislocation.

(4) Areas adversely affected by reductions in defense spending or the closure or realignment of military installations.

(5) Areas that have an unemployment rate greater than the national average unemployment rate for the most recent 12
months for which satisfactory data are available.



Appendix 5 



The Corporation is in the process of determining the advisability of requiring health care policies for Summer of
Safety participants. That determination will be discussed with prospective grantees prior to entering into a final
grant agreement.

The Act requires that service programs make child care available or provide an allowance for child care for service
participants. The Act further requires the Corporation to issue guidelines for child care and the child care allowance.

Below is the guidance contained in the Corporation's proposed regulations,  2522.250, published in the 

Federal Register

 (Volume 59, No. 5) on January 7, 1994. This guidance is subject to change upon issuance of the Corporation's final regulations.

(a) 

Child care

. Grantees must provide child care through an eligible provider or a child care allowance in an amount determined by
the Corporation to those full-time participants who need child care in order to participate.

(1) 

Need

. A participant is considered to need child care in order to participate in the program if he or she:

(i) Is the parent or legal guardian of, or is acting in loco parentis for, a child under 13 who resides with the participant;

(ii) Has a family income that does not exceed 75 percent of the State's median income for a family of the same size;

(iii) At the time of acceptance into the program, is not currently receiving child care assistance from another source,
including a parent or guardian, which would continue to be provided while the participant serves in the program; and


(iv) Certifies that he or she needs child care in order to participate in the program.

(2) 

Provider eligibility

. Eligible child care providers are those who are eligible child care providers as defined in the Child Care and Development
Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858n(5).

(3) 

Child care allowance

. The amount of the child care allowance will be determined by the Corporation based on payment rates for the Child Care
and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858c(4)(A).

(4) 

Federal share

. The Corporation will pay 100% of the child care allowance, or if the program provides child care through an eligible
provider, the actual cost of the care or the amount of the allowance, whichever is less.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-220), the information collection requirements
have been assigned OMB Control Number 2502-0267. 



I. Purpose and Substantive Description 



A. Authority 



Section 801 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) amended section 202 of the Housing Act
of 1959. Section 202 was also amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCD Act of 1992). The Secretary
is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and nonprofit consumer cooperatives to
expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. The assistance is provided as capital advances and contracts
for project rental assistance in accordance with 24 CFR part 889. This assistance may be used to finance the construction
or rehabilitation of a structure, or acquisition of a structure from the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), to be
used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with part 889. 

For supportive housing for the elderly, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and
Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994, (Pub. L. 103-124, enacted October 28, 1993, (Fiscal Year 1994
Appropriations Act) provides $1,158,000,000 for capital advances, including amendments to capital advance contracts
(not procurement contracts), for housing for the elderly as authorized by section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, (as
amended by the NAHA and HCD Act of 1992), and for project rental assistance, and amendments to contracts for project
rental assistance, for supportive housing for the elderly under section 202(c)(2) of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended.
Any unreserved balances provided in prior years for such purposes are to be merged with amounts provided in the Fiscal
Year 1994 Appropriations Act. 

In accordance with an agreement between HUD and the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) which facilitates the coordination
between the two agencies in administering their respective rental assistance programs, HUD is required to notify
FmHA of applications for housing assistance it receives. The purpose of this notification is to give FmHA the opportunity
to comment if it has concern about the demand for additional assisted housing and possible harm to existing projects
in the same housing market area. HUD will consider the FmHA comments in its review and project selection process. 



B. Allocation Amounts 



In accordance with 24 CFR part 791, the Assistant Secretary will allocate the amounts available for capital advances
for supportive housing for the elderly. The Department reserves project rental assistance funds sufficient for
20-year project rental assistance contracts in support of the units selected for capital advances, consistent with
current operating cost standards. 

The allocation formula for section 202 funds consists of a measure of the number of one- and two-person elderly renter
households with incomes at or below the very low-income limit (50 percent of area median family income, as determined
by HUD, with an adjustment for household size), which have housing deficiencies. 

Applicants for capital advances in the area served by the Washington, DC, Field Office are hereby put on notice that
the capital advance amount available to the DC Office, as stated in this NOFA, may be reduced or eliminated due to ongoing
legal proceedings occurring between HUD and a prior-year applicant, and that the determination of whether to reduce
or eliminate those funds is entirely within the discretion of HUD. If such action or actions are taken, a notice to that
effect will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 

Based on this formula, the Department has allocated the available capital advance funds as shown on the following
chart:

C. Eligibility 



The only eligible applicants under this program are private, nonprofit organizations and nonprofit consumer cooperatives.
Neither a public body nor an instrumentality of a public body is eligible to participate in the program. No organization
shall participate as Sponsor or Co-sponsor in the filing of application(s) for a capital advance in a single region
in this fiscal year in excess of that necessary to finance the construction, rehabilitation or acquisition (acquisition
permitted only with RTC properties) of 300 units of housing and related facilities for the elderly. This limit shall
apply to organizations that participate as Co-sponsors regardless of whether the Co-sponsors are affiliated or
non-affiliated entities. In addition, the national limit for any one applicant is 10 percent of the total units allocated
in all Regions. Affiliated entities which submit separate applications shall be deemed to be a single entity for the
purposes of these limits. No single application may propose more than the number of units allocated to a Field Office
or 125 units, whichever is less. Reservations for projects will not be approved for less than 40 units in metropolitan
areas or less than 5 units in nonmetropolitan areas. 



D. Initial Screening, Technical Processing and Selection Criteria 



1. Initial Screening 



Applications for section 202 capital advances that are received by HUD at the appropriate address by 4 p.m. local time
on May 3, 1994 will be reviewed to determine if all parts of the application are included. HUD will not review the content
of the application as part of initial screening. Deficiency letters will be sent informing Sponsors of any missing
parts of the application. Sponsors must correct such deficiencies within 14 calendar days from the date of the deficiency
letter. The deficiency letter is to be sent by certified mail. Any document requested as a result of the initial screening
may be executed or prepared within the deficiency period, except for Forms HUD-92015-CAs, Articles of
Incorporation, IRS exemption rulings, Forms SF-424, Board Resolution committing the minimum capital investment,
and site control documents (all of these excepted items must be dated no later than the application deadline date).




2. Technical Processing. 



All applications will be placed in technical processing upon receipt of the response to the deficiency letter or at
the end of the 14-day period. All applications will undergo a complete analysis. If a reviewer finds that clarification
is needed to complete the review or an exhibit is missing that was not requested after initial screening, the reviewer
shall immediately advise the Multifamily Housing Representative who will: (a) Request, by telephone, that the Sponsor
submit the information within five (5) working days, and (b) follow up by certified letter. Communications must be
attached to the technical review and findings memorandum. As part of this analysis, HUD will conduct its environmental
review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50. Examples of reasons for technical processing rejection include an ineligible
Sponsor, ineligible population to be served, lack of legal capacity, lack of site control and unacceptable site based
upon a site visit. The Secretary will not reject an application based on technical processing without giving notice
of that rejection with all rejection reasons, and affording the applicant an opportunity to appeal. An applicant
will be afforded 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's written notice to appeal a technical rejection to the Field
Office. The Field Office must respond within 5 working days to the Sponsor. The Field Office shall make a determination
on an appeal prior to making its selection recommendations. All applications will be either rated or technically
rejected at the end of technical processing. 

Technical processing will also assure that if the Sponsor has been found by a court or by a Federal, State, or local agency,
in noncompliance with any of the statutes, regulations, or other requirements listed in the civil rights certification
( 889.270(b)(8)(i)), HUD will obtain from the Sponsor a statement of the actions taken to correct that noncompliance.
There must be no pending civil rights suits against the Sponsor instituted by the Department of Justice and no pending
administrative actions for civil rights violations instituted by HUD. Moreover, there must not be a deferral of the
processing of applications from the Sponsor imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Department's
implementing regulations (24 CFR 1.8), procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), and the Attorney General's Guidelines
(28 CFR 50.3); or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Department's implementing regulations
(24 CFR 8.57), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 

Upon completion of technical processing, all acceptable applications will be rated according to the selection criteria
in  889.300(d) (also below in I.D.3). Applications which have a total score of 50 points or more will be eligible

long-term basis (7 points). 



II. Application Process 



All applications for Section 202 capital advances submitted by eligible Sponsors must be filed with the appropriate
HUD Field Office receiving an allocation and must meet the requirements of this Notice. No application will be accepted
after 4 p.m. local time on May 3, 1994, unless that date and time is extended by a Notice published in the 

Federal Register

. Applications received after that date and time will not be accepted, even if postmarked by the deadline date. Applications
submitted by facsimile are not acceptable. 

Immediately upon publication of this NOFA, if names have not already been provided to the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse,
Field Offices shall notify elderly and minority media, all persons and organizations on their mailing lists and minority
and other organizations within their jurisdiction involved in housing and community development and groups with
special interest in housing for elderly households. 

Organizations interested in applying for a section 202 capital advance should contact the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse
at 1-800-955-2232 for a copy of the application package, and advise the appropriate Field Office
whether they wish to attend the workshop described below. HUD encourages minority organizations to participate
in this program as Sponsors. Field Offices will advise all organizations on their mailing list of the date, time and
place of workshops at which the Section 202 Program will be explained. 

HUD strongly recommends that prospective applicants attend the local Field Office workshop. Interested persons
with disabilities should contact the Field Office to assure that any necessary arrangements can be made for them to
enable their attendance and participation in the workshop. While strongly urged to do so, if Sponsors cannot attend
a workshop, Application Packages can be obtained from the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse (see address and telephone
number under 

SUMMARY

 above). However, Sponsors must contact the appropriate Field Office with any questions regarding the submission
of applications and for any additional application requirements. 

At the workshops, application procedures and requirements will be explained. Also, concerns such as local market
conditions, building codes, historic preservation, floodplain management, displacement and relocation, zoning
and housing costs will be addressed.

A. Application




Each application shall include all of the information, materials, forms, and exhibits listed in section III. B. below,
with the exception of applications submitted by Sponsors selected for a Section 202 fund reservation within the last
three funding cycles, and must be indexed and tabbed. Previously selected Section 202 Sponsors are not required to
submit the information described in B. 2. (a), (b) and (c) below (Exhibit 2, a., b., and 
c. of the application which are the articles of incorporation, (or other organizational documents), by-laws, and
the IRS tax exemption, respectively). The Field Office will base its determination of the eligibility of a new Sponsor
for a reservation of section 202 capital advance funds on the information provided in the application. Field Offices
will verify a Sponsor's indication of previous HUD approval by checking the project number and approval status with
the appropriate Field Office. If there has been a change in any of the eligibility documents since its previous HUD
approval, the Sponsor must submit the updated information in its application. 

In addition to this relief of paperwork burden in preparing applications, applicants will be able to utilize information
and exhibits previously prepared for prior applications under section 202, section 811 or other funding programs.
Examples of exhibits that may be readily adapted or amended to decrease the burden of application preparation include,
among others, those on previous participation in the section 202 or section 811 programs; applicant experience in
provision of housing and services; supportive services plan; community ties, and experience serving minorities.




B. General Application Requirements



1. Form HUD-92015-CA, Application for Section 202 Supportive Housing Capital Advance. 

2. Evidence of 

each

 Sponsor's legal status as a private, nonprofit organization or nonprofit consumer cooperative, including the following:


(a) Articles of Incorporation, constitution, or other organizational documents; 

(b) By-laws; 

(c) IRS tax exemption ruling (this must be submitted by all Sponsors, including churches). A nonprofit organization
organized in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and exempt from income taxation under Puerto Rico law, or a consumer cooperative
that is tax exempt under State law, has never been liable for payment of Federal income taxes, and does not pay patronage
dividends may be exempt from the requirement set out in the previous sentence if they are not eligible for tax exemption;
and 

(d) Resolution of the board, duly certified by an officer, that no officer or director of the Sponsor or Owner has or
will have any financial interest in any contract with the Owner or in any firm or corporation which has or will have a
contract with the Owner and which includes a current listing of all duly qualified and sitting officers and directors
by title and the beginning and ending date of each person's term.

 


[

Note:

 Sponsors who have received a section 202 fund reservation within the last three funding cycles are not required to
submit the documents described in (a), (b), and (c), above. Instead, sponsors must submit the project number of the
most recently selected application and the field office to which it was submitted. If there have been any modifications
or additions to the subject documents, indicate such, and submit the new material.]

 


3. CHAS certification. The Sponsor must submit a certification by the jurisdiction in which the proposed project
will be located that the Sponsor's application is consistent with the jurisdiction's HUD-approved CHAS for FY 1994.
The certification must be made by the unit of general local government if it is required to have, or has, a complete CHAS.
Otherwise the certification may be made by the State, or if the project will be located in a unit of general local government
authorized to use an abbreviated strategy, by the unit of general local government if it is willing to prepare such
a CHAS. 

All CHAS certifications must be made by the public official responsible for submitting the CHAS to HUD. All CHAS certifications
must be submitted as part of the application by the application submission deadline set forth in this NOFA, except
as provided in the next paragraph. The required CHAS must therefore have been submitted more than 60 days before the
application submission deadline, since HUD has 60 days to review and approve the CHAS. Where the certification of
consistency is permitted to be submitted after the application submission deadline, as described in the next paragraph,
the CHAS must be submitted for approval in time for the certification to be made by the later date. In no event will an
application be considered if the CHAS has not been submitted for approval by the application submission deadline.

If the required certification will be made by a unit of general local government with respect to an abbreviated strategy,
and such CHAS has been submitted by the application submission deadline but has not yet been approved by HUD, the deadline
will not be applied to the certification for consistency. Instead, the application must include a written statement
from the public official responsible for submitting the CHAS that the jurisdiction has submitted an abbreviated
strategy for FY 1994 for HUD approval and that the application is consistent with the CHAS. If HUD approved the CHAS,
the required certification that the application is consistent with a HUD-approved CHAS for FY 1994 must be submitted
before June 2, 1994. An application will not be selected for funding unless the CHAS is approved and the required certification
is made by June 2, 1994. The CHAS regulations are published in 24 CFR part 91. 

4. E.O. 12372. A certification that the Sponsor has submitted a copy of its applications, if required, to the State
agency (single point of contact) for State review in accordance with Executive Order 12372. 

5. SF-424. A certification on SF-424, Application for Federal Assistance, that the Sponsor(s) is not
delinquent on the repayment of any Federal debt.

6. Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000, the certification with
regard to lobbying required by 24 CFR part 87 must be included. If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000 and
the applicant has made or has agreed to make any payment using nonappropriated funds for lobbying activity, as described
in 24 CFR part 87, the submission must also include SF-LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. The applicant
determines if the submission of the SF-LLL form is applicable.

7. A statement that (a) identifies all persons (families, individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations
identified by race/minority group, and status as owners or tenants) occupying the property on the date of submission
of the application for a capital advance; (b) indicates the estimated cost of relocation payments and other services,
and (c) identifies the staff organization that will carry out the relocation activities.




[

Note:

 If any of the relocation costs will be funded from sources other than the section 202 capital advance, the sponsor must
provide evidence of a firm commitment of these funds. When evaluating applications, HUD will consider the total cost
of proposals (

i.e.,

 cost of site acquisition, relocation, construction and other project costs).]




8. Additional Certifications. 

(a) A certification of the Sponsor(s)' intent to comply with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.
794) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-3619) and the implementing

willingness of Sponsor to assist the Owner to develop, own, manage and provide appropriate services in connection
with the proposed project, and that it reflects the will of its membership. Also, evidence, in the form of a certified
Board Resolution, of the Sponsor's willingness to fund the estimated start-up expenses, the Minimum Capital Investment
(one-half of one percent of the HUD-approved capital advance, not to exceed $10,000, if non-affiliated with National
Sponsor; one-half of one percent of the HUD-approved capital advance, not to exceed $25,000, for all other Sponsors;
see 889.250), and the estimated cost of any amenities or features (and operating costs related thereto) which would
not be covered by the approved capital advance. 

14. A list of the applications, if any, the Sponsor has submitted or is planning to submit to any other Field Office in
response to this NOFA or the NOFA for Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (published elsewhere in today's

assisted housing for the elderly (HUD and FmHA) (

e.g.

, public housing), state or local data on the limitations in activities of daily living among the elderly in the area,
aging in place in existing assisted rentals; trends in demographic changes in elderly population and households;
the numbers of income eligible elderly households by size, tenure and housing condition, and the types of supportive
services arrangements currently available in the area and the utilization of such services as evidenced by data from
local social service agencies or agencies on aging. 

17. Evidence of site control and permissive zoning. 

(a) Evidence that the Sponsor has entered into a legally binding option agreement to buy or lease the proposed site;
or has a copy of the contract of sale for the site, a deed, long-term leasehold, a request with all supporting documentation,
submitted either prior to or with the Application for Capital Advance, for a partial release of a site covered by a mortgage
under a HUD program or other evidence of legal ownership of the site (including properties to be acquired from the Resolution

of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. However, in localities where HUD determines the time
constraints of the funding round will not permit all of the required official actions (

e.g.

, approval of Community Planning Boards) which are necessary to convey publicly-owned sites, a letter in the application
from the Mayor or Director of the appropriate local agency indicating approval of conveyance of the site contingent
upon the necessary approval action is acceptable and may be approved by the Field Office if it has satisfactory experience
with timely conveyance of sites from that public body. In such cases, documentation shall also include a copy of the
public body's evidence of ownership and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses.
For properties to be acquired from the RTC, include a copy of the RTC prepared Transaction Screen Checklist or Phase
I Environmental Site Assessment, and applicable documentation, per the RTC Environmental Guidelines.

(b) Evidence that the project as proposed is permissible under applicable zoning ordinances or regulations, or a
statement of the proposed action required to make the proposed project permissible and the basis for belief that the
proposed action will be completed successfully before the submission of the commitment application (

e.g.

, a summary of the results of any recent requests for rezoning on land in similar zoning classifications and the time
required for such rezoning, preliminary indications of acceptability from zoning bodies, 

etc

.). 

18. Narrative description of site and area surrounding the site, characteristics of neighborhood, how the site will

IV. Other Matters 



A. Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of
No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,
Office of General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington,
DC 20410. 



B. Federalism Executive Order 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12612, Federalism, has
determined that this NOFA does not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or
on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. This NOFA merely notifies the public of the availability of capital advances
and project rental assistance for supportive housing for the elderly. 



C. Family Executive Order 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that
this NOFA does not significantly affect family formation, maintenance, or general well-being, and, thus, is not
subject to review under the order. 



D. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 



HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by HUD. On January 14, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public
(including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation, public
access, and disclosure requirements of section 102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements
of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: 



1. Documentation and Public Access 



HUD will ensure documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA
are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters
of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after
the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.
552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance
pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 



2. Disclosures 



HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 



E. Documentation and Public Access Requirements: HUD Reform Act 



HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)

F. Section 103 


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was
published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part
4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement
of the selection of successful applicants. 
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel for the program to which the question pertains. 


G. Lobbying 


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 
Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to the Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (TDD/Voice).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.



H. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of Section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the
Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-220), the information collection requirements
have been assigned OMB Control Number 2502-0462. 


I. Purpose and Substantive Description 


A. Authority 


Section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (the NAHA) (and as amended by the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), authorized a new supportive housing program for persons with
disabilities and replaced assistance for persons with disabilities previously covered by section 202 of the Housing
Act of 1959 (section 202 continues, as amended by section 801 of the NAHA, and HCD Act of 1992, to authorize supportive
housing for the elderly). The assistance is provided as capital advances and contracts for project rental assistance
in accordance with 24 CFR part 890. Capital advances may be used to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition
with or without rehabilitation, including acquisition from the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), of structures
to be developed into a variety of housing options ranging from group homes and independent living facilities, to dwelling
units in multifamily housing developments, condominium housing and cooperative housing. Acquisition without
rehabilitation is permitted only for group homes or properties acquired from the RTC. This assistance may also cover
the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses
that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for persons with disabilities.

For supportive housing for persons with disabilities, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban
Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103-124, enacted October 28, 1993,
(Fiscal Year 1994 Appropriations Act) provides $387,000,000 for capital advances, for supportive housing for persons
with disabilities, as authorized by section 811 of the NAHA, and for project rental assistance, and amendments to
contracts for project rental assistance, for supportive housing for persons with disabilities as authorized by
section 811 of the NAHA. Any unreserved balances provided in prior years for such purposes are to be merged with amounts
provided in the Fiscal Year 1994 Appropriations Act. It should be noted that although section 623 of the HCD Act of 1992
authorizes tenant-based assistance for persons with disabilities, appropriations have not been provided. 
In accordance with an agreement between HUD and the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) which facilitates the coordination
between the two agencies in administering their respective rental assistance programs, HUD is required to notify
FmHA of applications for housing assistance it receives. The purpose of this notification is to give FmHA the opportunity
to comment if it has concern about the demand for additional assisted housing and possible harm to existing projects
in the same housing market area. HUD will consider the FmHA comments in its review and project selection process. 


B. Allocation Amounts 


In accordance with 24 CFR part 791, the Assistant Secretary will allocate the amounts available for capital advances
for supportive housing for persons with disabilities. The Department reserves project rental assistance funds
sufficient for 20-year project rental assistance contracts in support of the units selected for capital advances,
consistent with current operating cost standards. 
The allocation formula for section 811 funds consists of the following two data elements: 
1. A measure of the number of non-institutionalized persons age 16 or older with a work disability and a mobility or
self-care limitation; and 
2. A measure of the number of non-institutionalized persons age 16 or older having a mobility or self-care limitation
but having no work disability. 
Based on this formula, the Department has allocated the available capital advance funds as shown on the following
chart:

C. Eligibility 


The only eligible applicants under this program are nonprofit organizations with section 501(c)(3) tax exemptions
from the Internal Revenue Service. A single Sponsor shall not request more units in a given Region than permitted for
that Region in the Invitation. 


D. Initial Screening, Technical Processing and Selection Criteria 


1. Initial Screening 


Applications for section 811 capital advances that are received by HUD at the appropriate address by 4 p.m. local time
on May 3, 1994, will be reviewed to determine if all parts of the application are included. HUD will not review the content
of the application as part of initial screening. Deficiency letters will be sent informing Sponsors of any missing
parts of the application. Sponsors must correct such deficiencies within 14 calendar days from the date of the deficiency
letter. The deficiency letter is to be sent by certified mail. Any document requested as a result of the initial screening
may be executed or prepared within the deficiency period, except for Forms HUD-92016-CAs, Articles of
Incorporation, IRS exemption rulings, Forms SF-424, Board Resolution committing the minimum capital investment,
and site control documents (all of these excepted items must be dated no later than the application deadline date).

2. Technical Processing



All applications will be placed in technical processing upon receipt of the response to the deficiency letter or at
the end of the 14-day period. All applications will undergo a complete analysis. If a reviewer finds that clarification
is needed to complete the review or an exhibit is missing that was not requested after initial screening, the reviewer
shall immediately advise the Multifamily Housing Representative who will: (a) Request, by telephone, that the Sponsor
submit the information within five (5) working days, and (b) follow up by certified letter. Communications must be
attached to the technical review and findings memorandum. As part of this analysis, HUD will conduct its environmental
review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50 on only those applications containing evidence of site control. Examples
of reasons for technical processing rejection include an ineligible Sponsor, ineligible population to be served,
lack of legal capacity and insufficient commitments or indications that supportive services will be available.
The Secretary will not reject an application based on technical processing without giving notice of that rejection
with all rejection reasons, and affording the applicant an opportunity to appeal. An applicant will be afforded 14
calendar days from the date of HUD's written notice to appeal a technical rejection to the Field Office. The Field Office
must respond within 5 working days to the Sponsor. The Field Office shall make a determination on an appeal prior to
making its selection recommendations. All applications will be either rated or 
Technically rejected at the end of technical processing. 

Technical processing will also assure that if the Sponsor has been found by a court or by a Federal, State, or local agency,
in noncompliance with any of the statutes, regulations, or other requirements listed in the civil rights certification
( 890.265(b)(9)(i)), HUD will obtain from the Sponsor a statement of the actions taken to correct that noncompliance.
There must be no pending civil rights suits against the Sponsor instituted by the Department of Justice and no pending
administrative actions for civil rights violations instituted by HUD. Moreover, there must not be a deferral of the
processing of applications from the Sponsor imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Department's
implementing regulations (24 CFR 1.8), procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), and the Attorney General's Guidelines
(28 CFR 50.3); or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Department's implementing regulations

II. Application Process 



All applications for Section 811 capital advances submitted by eligible Sponsors must be filed with the appropriate
HUD Field Office receiving an allocation and must meet the requirements of this Notice. No application will be accepted
after 4 p.m. local time on May 3, 1994, unless that date and time is extended by a Notice published in the 

Federal Register

. Applications received after that date and time will not be accepted, even if postmarked by the deadline date. Applications
submitted by facsimile are not acceptable. 

Immediately upon publication of this NOFA, if names have not already been provided to the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse,
Field Offices shall notify minority media and media for persons with disabilities, all persons and organizations
on their mailing lists and minority and other organizations within their jurisdiction involved in housing and community
development and groups with special interest in housing for disabled households. 

Organizations interested in applying for a section 811 capital advance should contact the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse
at 1-800-955-2232 for a copy of the application package and advise the appropriate Field Office
whether they wish to attend the workshop described below. HUD encourages minority organizations to participate
in this program as Sponsors. Field Offices will advise all organizations on their mailing list of the date, time and
place of workshops at which the Section 811 Program will be explained. 

HUD strongly recommends that prospective applicants attend the local Field Office workshop. Interested persons
with disabilities should contact the Field Office to assure that any necessary arrangements can be made for them to
enable their attendance and participation in the workshop. While strongly urged to do so, if Sponsors cannot attend
a workshop, Application Packages can be obtained from the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse (see address and telephone
number under SUMMARY above). However, Sponsors must contact the appropriate Field Office with any questions regarding
the submission of applications and for any additional application requirements. 

At the workshops, application procedures and requirements will be explained. Also, concerns such as local market
conditions, building codes, historic preservation, floodplain management, displacement and relocation, zoning,
housing costs and service plan requirements will be addressed. 



III. Application Submission Requirements 



A. Application 



Each application shall include all of the information, materials, forms, and exhibits listed in section III. B. below,
with the exception of applications submitted by Sponsors selected for a Section 811 fund reservation within the last
three funding cycles, and must be indexed and tabbed. Previously selected Section 811 Sponsors are not required to
submit the information described in B. 2. (a), (b) and (c) below (Exhibit 2, a. b., and c. of the application which are
the articles of incorporation (or other organizational documents), by-laws, and the IRS tax exemption, respectively).
The Field Office will base its determination of the eligibility of a new Sponsor for a reservation of section 811 capital
advance funds on the information provided in the application. Field Offices will verify a Sponsor's indication of
previous HUD approval by checking the project number and approval status with the appropriate Field Office. If there
has been a change in any of the eligibility documents since its previous HUD approval, the Sponsor must submit the updated
information in its application. 

In addition to this relief of paperwork burden in preparing applications, applicants will be able to utilize information
and exhibits previously prepared for prior applications under section 811, section 202 or other funding programs.
Examples of exhibits that may be readily adapted or amended to decrease the burden of application preparation include,
among others, those on previous participation in the section 202 or section 811 programs; applicant experience in
the provision of housing and services; supportive services plan; community ties, and experience serving minorities.




B. General Application Requirements 



1. Form HUD-92016-CA, Application for Section 811 Supportive Housing Capital Advance. 




[

Note:

 A sponsor may apply for a scattered site project provided each site contains the same facility type (

e.g.

, group home, independent living facility, condominium unit). If the sponsor proposes a mix of facility types, it
must submit one application per facility type].

2. Evidence of each Sponsor's legal status as a nonprofit organization, including the following:



(a) Articles of Incorporation, constitution, or other organizational documents; 



(b) By-laws; 



(c) IRS section 501(c)(3) tax exemption ruling (this must be submitted by all Sponsors, including churches). A nonprofit
organization organized in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and exempt from income taxation under Puerto Rico law,
has never been liable for payment of Federal income taxes, and does not pay patronage dividends may be exempt from the
requirement set out in the previous sentence if they are not eligible for tax exemption; and 
(d) Resolution of the board, duly certified by an officer, that no officer or director of the Sponsor or Owner has or
will have any financial interest in any contract with the Owner or in any firm or corporation which has or will have a
contract with the Owner and which includes a current listing of all duly qualified and sitting officers and directors
by title and the ending date of each person's term. 




[

Note:

 Sponsors who have received a section 811 fund reservation within the last three funding cycles are not required to
submit the documents described in (a), (b), and (c), above. Instead, sponsors must submit the project number of the
most recently selected application and the field office to which it was submitted. If there have been any modifications
or additions to the subject documents, indicate such, and submit the new material.]

 




3. CHAS certification. The Sponsor must submit a certification by the jurisdiction in which the proposed project
will be located that the Sponsor's application is consistent with the jurisdiction's HUD-approved CHAS for FY 1994.
The certification must be made by the unit of general local government if it is required to have, or has, a complete CHAS.
Otherwise the certification may be made by the State, or if the project will be located in a unit of general local government
authorized to use an abbreviated strategy, by the unit of general local government if it is willing to prepare such
a CHAS. 



All CHAS certifications must be made by the public official responsible for submitting the CHAS to HUD. All CHAS certifications
must be submitted as part of the application by the application submission deadline set forth in this NOFA, except
as provided in the next paragraph. The required CHAS must therefore have been submitted more than 60 days before the
application submission deadline, since HUD has 60 days to review and approve the CHAS. Where the certification of
consistency is permitted to be submitted after the application submission deadline, as described in the next paragraph,
the CHAS must be submitted for approval in time for the certification to be made by the later date. In no event will an
application be considered if the CHAS has not been submitted for approval by the application submission deadline.




If the required certification will be made by a unit of general local government with respect to an abbreviated strategy,
and such CHAS has been submitted by the application submission deadline but has not yet been approved by HUD, the deadline
will not be applied to the certification for consistency. Instead, the application must include a written statement
from the public official responsible for submitting the CHAS that the jurisdiction has submitted an abbreviated
strategy for FY 1994 for HUD approval and that the application is consistent with the CHAS. If HUD approved the CHAS,
the required certification that the application is consistent with a HUD-approved CHAS for FY 1994 must be submitted
before June 2, 1994. An application will not be selected for funding unless the CHAS is approved and the required certification
is made by June 2, 1994. The CHAS regulations are published in 24 CFR part 91. 



4. E.O. 12372. A certification that the Sponsor has submitted a copy of its application, if required, to the State agency
(single point of contact) for State review in accordance with Executive Order 12372. 



5. Supportive Services Certification. A certification from the appropriate State or local agency that the provision
of supportive services is well designed to serve the special needs of persons with disabilities (the name, address,
and telephone number of the appropriate agency can be obtained from the Field Office).

6. SF-424. A certification on SF-424, Application for Federal Assistance, that the Sponsor(s) is not
delinquent on the repayment of any Federal debt. 



7. Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000, the certification with
regard to lobbying required by 24 CFR part 87 must be included. If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000 and
the applicant has made or has agreed to make any payment using nonappropriated funds for lobbying activity, as described
in 24 CFR part 87, the submission must also include SF-LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. The applicant determines
if the submission of the SF-LLL form is applicable. 



8. A statement that (a) identifies all persons (families, individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations
(identified by race/minority group, and status as owners or tenants) occupying the property on the date of submission
of the application for a capital advance (or date of initial site control, if later); (b) indicates the estimated cost
of relocation payments and other services, and (c) identifies the staff organization that will carry out the relocation
activities.






[

Note:

 If any of the relocation costs will be funded from sources other than the section 811 capital advance, the sponsor must
provide evidence of a firm commitment of these funds. When evaluating applications, HUD will consider the total cost
of proposals (i.e., cost of site acquisition, relocation, construction and other project costs).]






9. Additional Certifications. 



(a) A certification of the Sponsor(s)' intent to comply with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.
794) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-3619) and the implementing

IV. Additional Information 



A. Sites 



The National Affordable Housing Act requires Sponsors submitting applications for section 811 fund reservations
to provide either (a) evidence of site control, or (b) reasonable assurances that it will have control of a site within
6 months of notification of fund reservation. Accordingly, if a Sponsor has control of a site at the time it submits
its application, it must include evidence of such as described in  890.265. If it does not have site control,
it must provide the information required in  890.265 as a reasonable assurance that site control will be obtained
within 6 months of fund reservation notification.

Sponsors may select a site different from the one(s) submitted in their original applications if the original site
is not approvable. Selection of a different site will require HUD performance of an environmental review on the new
site, which could result in rejection of that site. However, if a Sponsor does not have site control for any reason 12
months after notification of fund reservation, the assistance will be recaptured and reallocated. 

Sponsors submitting satisfactory evidence of an approvable site (

i.e.

, site control) will compete against each other in Category A. Sponsors submitting proper identification of a site
will compete against each other in Category B. HUD first shall select applications in the descending order of funding
priority from Category A that most closely approximates the capital advance authority provided to the allocation
area. If capital advance authority remains after selecting all approvable applications from Category A, HUD shall
then select applications in the descending order of funding priority from Category B that most closely approximates
the capital advance authority remaining in the allocation area. 

Applications containing evidence of site control where either the evidence or the site is not approvable will 

not

 be rejected provided the application indicates the Sponsor's willingness to select another site and an assurance
that site control will be obtained within six months of fund reservation notification. Such applications will compete
for selection in Category B. However, only those applications where the evidence of site control was not approvable
will be eligible to receive any of the possible 17 points under selection criteria (b) (2) and (3) (see I.D.3.(b) (2)
and (3) above). Applications where the site was rejected will receive 0 points under selection criteria (b) (2) and
(3). 

In the case of a scattered site application submitted with evidence of site control for all of the sites, the evidence
must be satisfactory for each site and all the sites must be approvable for the application to compete in Category A.
If such an application does not fulfill this requirement, it will be placed in Category B and will be eligible to receive
a prorated share of the 17 points possible under selection criteria (b) (2) and (3) based on the number of sites that
are approvable. The same applies to a scattered site application in which the Sponsor has control of some of the sites
and has identified others. It would also be considered in Category B and would be eligible for a prorated share of the
17 points as stated above.

V. Other Matters 


A. Environmental Impact 


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of
No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,
Office of General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, Southwest,
Washington, DC 20410. 


B. Federalism Executive Order 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12612, Federalism, has
determined that this NOFA does not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or
on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. This NOFA merely notifies the public of the availability of capital advances
for supportive housing for persons with disabilities. 


C. Family Executive Order 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that
this NOFA does not significantly affect family formation, maintenance, or general well-being, and, thus, is not
subject to review under the order. 


D. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 


HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by HUD. On January 14, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public
(including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation, public
access, and disclosure requirements of section 102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements
of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: 


1. Documentation and Public Access


HUD will ensure documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA
are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters
of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after
the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.
552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance
pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 


2. Disclosures


HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 


E. Documentation and Public Access Requirements: HUD Reform Act 


HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 


F. Section 103 


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was
published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part
4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement
of the selection of successful applicants. 
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by Part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel for the program to which the question pertains. 


G. Lobbying 


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance.

Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 
Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to the Director, Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 TDD/Voice).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.



H. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of Section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the
Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.



I. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program

Disabilities.
