Radiation Protection Requirements; Amended Definitions and Criteria 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to amend its regulations concerning radiation protection requirements.
The proposed rule would: Delete the definition of ``Controlled area'' to make it clear that any area to which access
is restricted for the purpose of radiological protection is a restricted area as defined in the regulation, revise
the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to delete reference to the ``Restricted area,'' revise the definition of
unrestricted area to be consistent with the deletion of controlled area, revise the provision entitled ``Instruction
to Workers,'' so that radiation protection training will be provided to all persons with the potential to be occupationally
exposed and restore a provision to provide that whenever licensees are required to report exposures of individual
members of the public to the NRC, then those individuals are to receive copies of the report. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On May 21, 1991, (56 FR 23360) the NRC amended 10 CFR part 20 to add its revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation
(10 CFR 20.1001-20.2402). Compliance became mandatory for all licensees on January 1, 1994. Extensive discussion
regarding interpretation and implementation of the new rules has ensued both within the NRC and Agreement State staffs
and with licensees and other interested parties. 

The revised standards include a definition for the term ``Controlled area.'' The term is defined to be an area outside
of a restricted area, but inside the site boundary access to which can be limited for any reason (10 CFR 20.1003). The
term ``Restricted area'' was retained in the revised standards from the original regulation, 10 CFR part 20, and is
defined as an area, ``access to which is limited by the licensees for the purpose of protecting individuals against
undue risks from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials * * * (10 CFR 20.1003).'' Neither
the revised standards themselves, nor the supplemental information provide a basis for deciding whether to designate
a given area as a ``Restricted area'' or a ``Controlled area.'' In discussions with licensees and Agreement States,
the absence of such a clear delineation appears to be the cause of considerable uncertainty among a number of licensees
regarding how to implement the revised standards in this regard. The NRC believes that this situation can be alleviated
by eliminating the term ``Controlled area'' from the regulations. This change has the effect of returning the regulation
to the former situation in which areas are either restricted or unrestricted for purposes of radiation protection.
As has always been the case, licensees continue to have the option of controlling access to areas for reasons other
than radiation protection. 

The definition of ``Unrestricted area'' in the revised standard acknowledges the existence of controlled areas
and currently is defined as an area ``access to which is neither limited nor controlled by the licensee'' (10 CFR 20.1003).
Deletion of the term ``Controlled area'' permits return to the former situation in which areas are either restricted
or unrestricted for radiation protection purposes, and the Commission now proposes to revise the definition of ``Unrestricted
area'' to make this clear. 

Under this proposal, licensees would continue to have the option to control access for reasons other than radiation
protection. As before, the definitions of ``restricted area'' and of ``unrestricted area'' do not preclude the existence
of areas in which access is limited for purposes other than protecting individuals against undue risks from exposure
to radiation and/or radioactive materials.

``Occupational dose'' is defined currently in the revised standards ``as the dose received by an individual in a restricted
area or in the course of employment in which the individual's assigned duties involve exposure to radiation and/or
to radioactive materials * * *.'' (10 CFR 20.1003) Through meetings with licensees to discuss the
revised standards, the Commission has become aware that this definition can be interpreted to allow individuals
who are members of the public to receive an ``occupational dose'' and exceed public dose limits if they enter restricted
areas. This was not the intention of the Commission in promulgating the revised standards. A fundamental principle
present in the regulations is that a member of the public is subject to the limits for a member of the public ( 20.1301
(a)(1)), irrespective of that individual's location. The Commission is separately considering revisions to parts
20 and 35, whereby licensees who have been administered radioactive materials to patients and released them in accordance
with  35.75 would be exempt from the provisions of  20.1301 (a)(1) with regard to the radioactive material
in the released patient. Licensees must be able to ensure that a member of the public, if present in a restricted area,
as well as any other area, will not exceed an exposure of 100 mrem/year. The suggestion that permission to expose a member
of the public to a dose in excess of 100 mrem in a year, is created by that individual's location in a restricted area,
can be removed by a simple modification to the definition of occupational dose, specifically by eliminating reference
to dose received in a restricted area. In addition, ``radiation and/or radioactive material'' should replace ``radiation
and radioactive material'' to correct a technical error in the text of the rule. With these changes, it would become
clear that occupational dose is dose received as a result of an individual's employment in which assigned duties involve
exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material. These changes would also make it clear that the dose received
by a member of the public cannot be permitted to exceed the public dose limit even if the individual is receiving a portion
of that dose while in a restricted area. The remainder of the definition of occupational dose would not be modified
by this action, and maintains the description of both what is included and what is excluded in occupational dose for
purposes of clarity. 

The regulation entitled ``Instruction to Workers,'' 10 CFR 19.12, currently requires that all individuals working
in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area be instructed in the health protection problems associated with
exposure to radiation and in radiation protection procedures needed to minimize exposure. Under this provision,
if a worker never enters a restricted area, he or she would require no radiation protection training. On the other hand,
members of the public, such as delivery persons who might occasionally enter a restricted area, would be required
to be trained even though the nature of their activities would perhaps not warrant such instruction. The proposed
change to  19.12 would make it clear that anyone in the course of their employment in which the individual's assigned
duties involve the potential for exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material would have to be provided appropriate
radiation protection training. 

Concern about training requirements has been expressed for certain categories of workers and members of the public
illustrated by the following cases: Case (1) involves a member of the public who is potentially exposed to some radiation
while visiting a facility or making deliveries, and, Case (2), a maintenance worker or contractor who is exposed to
radiation while performing repairs or cleaning. In order to decide if training is required, and what type of training
is appropriate, certain provisions of the rules must be considered. 

First, after January 1, 1994, a member of the public cannot be permitted to receive more than 100 mrem in a year unless
specifically approved by the Commission (10 CFR 20.1301).

1

 Second, training commensurate with the potential radiological health protection problems present would be required
by the proposed 10 CFR 19.12 only for individuals whose assigned duties involve a potential for exposure to radiation
and/or radioactive materials. In the first case above, the individual's activities, i.e., visiting a facility or
making deliveries, were not assigned by the licensee or a licensee contractor. Under these conditions, the individual
is a member of the public, and the licensee must ensure that exposures are less than 100 mrem in a year, and further must
be as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Doses to these individuals should be controlled by other measures that
would be included in an ALARA program, such as shielding, escorting, removing radioactive sources during visits,
and controlling stay-times. Therefore, the Commission believes training is not required. However, nothing in the
rules prevents providing training to any individuals.

<TEXT>
 

In the second case, the individual's activities, i.e., performing repairs or cleaning, are performed during the
course of employment with the licensee or a contractor to the licensee and the individuals' assigned duties do involve
the potential for exposure to radiation. Although the individual may not enter a restricted area and, whether this
worker's dose exceeds 100 mrem in a year or not, if the worker has the potential to receive some occupational exposure,
training ``commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems present in the workplace'' is
required to ensure informed consent and control of exposure. This training does not have to be extensive. The Commission
believes that doses received by individual workers at a rate greater than the 1mSv (100 mrem) in a year public dose limit
constitute a level of risk which requires training at least to a level which provides information on the risks of exposure
and methods for reducing exposure in keeping with the ALARA principle. 
Prior to the promulgation of the revised standards, paragraph 20.409(b) of part 20 provided that whenever a licensee
is required to report to the Commission any exposure of an identified individual worker or member of the public to radiation
and/or radioactive material, the licensee must also notify that individual.

2

 Although it was the intent of the Commission that this provision remain in 10 CFR part 20, the requirement was inadvertently
omitted from the revised standards. Accordingly,  20.2205 is added to clearly restore to 10 CFR part 20 the intention
that individual workers and individual members of the public are to be notified of exposures in excess of the dose limits
that would require notifying the NRC. Under  20.2205, the licensees' obligation to notify an individual will
be triggered if (and only if) the licensee's required report to NRC identifies that individual by name as having received
an exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive material. The licensee's obligation to identify individuals in a
required report to the NRC is as provided for in 10 CFR 20.2203. 




Agreement States 


The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC licensees and Agreement States (Definitions in 10 CFR part 20 are Division
I matters and are thus matters of compatibility). The proposed changes, with the exception of the addition of  20.2205
and the revision of the definition of unrestricted area, were discussed in June 1993 with Agreement State representatives
and the changes discussed were strongly supported. Agreement States have the opportunity to comment further on all
of the proposed changes during the public comment period. The Agreement States cannot be expected to modify their
regulations before the January 1, 1994, date. Some States will need as much as 3 years to conform to the changes. In the
interim, States may wish to consider alternative methods to address the issues presented in this rulemaking. 
A draft of the proposed amendments, with the exception of the addition of  20.2205 and the revision of the definition
of unrestricted area, was provided to the Agreement States prior to submitting the amendments for publication in
the 

Federal Register

. Several States submitted comments. One State suggested limiting public doses to ``licensed'' sources of radiation
while another observed that keeping this provision general permitted the States to control exposure from Naturally
Occurring and Accelerator Produced Radioactive Material (NARM) as well as byproduct material. The proposed rule
is general and does not specify licensed sources. This approach is consistent with the rule, as expressed in  20.1001
to control doses from all sources of radiation that are under the control of the licensee. 
Another State provided a revised definition of ``Member of the Public'' which would not rely on the definition of ``Occupational
dose'' and would make clear that workers exposed to NARM are not members of the public. The intent here was to minimize
the change to the definitions and still accomplish the needed clarifications of these issues. For that reason and
because ``Occupational dose'' is defined as from ``licensed or unlicensed'' sources, this change is not made in the
proposed rule. 
Two States argued that the draft language restricting the training requirements in 10 CFR 19.12 to individuals involved
``in licensed activities'' and ``in the licensee's facility'' was too restrictive, and might prevent workers such
as housekeeping staff and security staff from receiving minimal, but needed training. The language of the training
requirement is more inclusive in this proposed rule.

One State proposed retaining in  20.2104(a) a requirement to determine prior occupational dose if an individual
enters the restricted area. The NRC staff believes that retaining only the words ``is likely to receive, in a year,
an occupational dose requiring monitoring,'' is sufficient to trigger a determination of prior dose. The State also
suggested wording which would make licensees responsible for accounting for occupational exposure from nonlicensed
activities. This is consistent with the Commission's position and the draft is revised accordingly. 



Description 



The provision in 10 CFR Part 20 for a ``Controlled area,'' its definition and its use in several other sections of Part
20 would be deleted. Licensees would continue to have the option to control access to areas for reasons other than radiation
protection. 

The proposed rulemaking would revise the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to delete reference to the ``Restricted
area'' so that the occupational dose limit and its associated radiation protection provisions, such as training
and individual monitoring requirements, would apply to an individual who in the course of employment has assigned
duties involving exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive material. This change would also indicate that public
dose limits cannot be exceeded for members of the public even if they enter a restricted area. 

The definition of ``Unrestricted area'' would be revised to make it clear that for the purposes of radiation protection
areas, are either restricted or unrestricted and that access to unrestricted areas can be controlled for reasons
other than radiation protection. 

``Instructions to Workers,'' 10 CFR 19.12, would be revised to make clear that training commensurate with the hazards
present must be provided to all individuals who have the potential to be occupationally exposed rather than just to
individuals working in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area. 

``Reports to individuals of exceeding dose limits,'' 10 CFR 20.2205, is added to restore to part 20 the Commission's
intent that any identified individual, including members of the public, who receives an exposure in excess of the
dose limits for which a report to the NRC is required, will receive notification of that exposure from the licensee.




Impact 



The Commission believes that these proposed changes will have some, albeit relatively minor, impacts on licensees.
The impacts associated with each of the changes are outlined below. 

For the deletion of the definition of controlled area, the Commission believes that there will be little impact on
most power reactor licensees. Although some confusion has surfaced associated with the intent of the terms ``controlled
area'' and ``occupational dose,'' these definitions have been discussed extensively with and by industry representatives,
and the Commission believes that the proposed rule generally reflects current and planned practices of many reactor
licensees. Licensees can continue to designate areas as controlled areas for purposes other than radiological protection,
irrespective of whether the term appears in the rule or not. 

Some licensees have already implemented the revised standards, and procedures have been written which would require
changes as a result of this proposed rulemaking if these procedures have employed the concept of controlling areas
for radiological protection. 

For those reactor licensees who have already formally implemented the revised standards or who have a need for the
additional flexibility afforded by the use of the concept of controlled area for purposes of radiological protection,
the provisions for exemptions from the NRC's regulations provides an avenue of relief. The NRC currently believes
that the elimination of the concept of ``Controlled area'' will have such a small impact on most power reactor licensees
that it does not constitute a backfit as envisioned by 10 CFR 50.109. The action removes flexibility but does not directly
impose new procedures. However, the NRC welcomes comments on whether this action does in fact constitute a backfit,
the degree of burden imposed by the action, particularly for licensees who have already implemented the revised standards,
and on whether in the limited matter of ``Controlled area,'' provisions for grandfathering should be provided in
the final rule to avoid such burdens. 

Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' further makes clear the NRC's intent that for purposes of radiation
protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted. Some minor modifications to procedures and training may
be necessitated by this change. 

For the change involving the term occupational exposure, the Commission believes that some minor editorial modifications
of procedures and training will be necessary. Occupational exposure was previously defined to include both presence
in a restricted area and activities involving exposure to radiation and/or radioactive materials. Elimination
of the reference to restricted areas will not change the scope of applicability of the term occupational dose for most
licensees' employees. Furthermore, this change as it relates to doses to members of the public, makes it clear that
doses to members of the public must remain within the limits for members of the public, even if they are present within
a restricted area. This distinction may result in some minor corrections to procedures and administrative control
levels. However, it should be noted that licensees have controlled and continue to control the exposure of these individuals
to small fractions of the public dose limit. Thus, there should be no significant change necessary in licensee activities.


The conforming change to 10 CFR part 19 is minor and will affect only a small number of licensees and will have a negligible
impact. For the modification of the training requirements to match the definition of occupational exposure, the
Commission believes that licensees will need to make relatively minor modifications to training procedures to reflect
the new definition. Training remains ``commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems''
and, thus, the scope of the training activities is not anticipated to require modification. The Commission also believes
that any small incremental increase in burden of additional occupationally exposed individuals requiring training
will be offset by the reduction in burden inherent in the fact that members of the public entering a restricted area
will no longer be required to be trained in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR part 19.

<TEXT>
 

The addition to 10 CFR part 20 of a requirement to notify individual workers and individual members of the public of
exposures in excess of the dose limits is not considered to impose any additional burden on licensees.

3

 The addition would make clear in 10 CFR part 20, where such a requirement would normally be expected, that when existing
reporting requirements would result in reporting exposure information on an identified individual member of the
public to NRC, then the identified individual would receive a report on his or her exposure. 





The impact of these proposed rule changes on materials licensees is considered to be minimal. The NRC believes that
these changes will provide additional clarity when implementing the revised 10 CFR part 20 and will not have an adverse
impact on the health and safety of workers or the public. Removing the implied option to establish controlled areas
for radiation protection purposes, and simplifying the definition and administration of occupational dose will
require minimal changes in procedures and in some cases may even involve a net reduction in burden. Licensees continue
to have the option to control access to areas for reasons other than radiological protection. Licensees who have already
written procedures including provisions for controlled areas for radiation protection purposes would have the
option to request exemptions. Materials licensees, particularly those who have already implemented the new regulations,
are invited to comment on whether or not the proposed changes impose significant burden. 



Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



The NRC has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations
in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. 

The option of establishing access control over an area owned by a licensee for reasons of security, for example, exists
whether or not the term ``Controlled area'' is specifically defined in 10 CFR part 20. The provision for controlled
areas in the rule is not a requirement. Deleting the term ``Controlled area'' from the rule is not expected to result
in a significant change in the number of areas to be controlled or in an increase in exposure to any member of the public.
Public access to licensee owned facilities and land is expected to remain unchanged as a result of this amendment.
No other environmental impact or benefit is associated with the ``Controlled area'' provision. 

Changing the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to make it clear that individuals whose assigned duties involve
exposure to radiation and radioactivity are subject to radiation protection procedures associated with occupational
exposure and that members of the public cannot be permitted to receive doses that exceed public dose limits just by
entering a restricted area is considered a benefit with no environmental impact. This change would have no effect
on the type or quantity of material released into the environment and, if anything, would make it less likely for members
of the public to be exposed to more than public dose limits.

Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' to make it clear that for purposes of radiation protection, areas
are either restricted or unrestricted, has no perceived environmental impact. 

Amending the radiation protection training requirements to clarify that they apply to individuals who in the course
of employment are potentially exposed to radiation and/or to radioactive material, regardless of whether they may
or may not be within a restricted area, will result in no impact on the environment. 

Adding  20.2205 to part 20, which would clearly restore the Commission's policy that individual workers and
individual members of the public are notified, whenever NRC is notified, that they have been exposed to radiation
or radioactive material in excess of the dose limits, will have no impact on the environment. 

The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available
for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room 2120 L Street, NW., (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of
the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available from Alan K. Roecklein, U.S. NRC,
5650 Nicholson Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, (301) 492-3740. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150-0044,
3150-0014, 3150-0005, and 3150-0006. 



Regulatory Analysis



The NRC has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and
benefits of the alternatives considered by the NRC. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public
Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis may be obtained
from Alan K. Roecklein, U.S. NRC, 5640 Nicholson Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, (301) 492-3740. 

The NRC requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted
to the NRC as indicated under the 

ADDRESSES 

heading. 



Regulatory Flexibility Certification 



Based upon the information available at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding and in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC certifies that, if promulgated, this rule will not have a significant economic
impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC and Agreement State
licensees. Because these amendments only clarify, restore, and conform existing requirements to the 1991 version
of part 20, they are considered to have no significant economic impact on any large or small entities. 

However, the NRC is seeking comments and suggested modifications because of the widely differing conditions under
which small licensees operate. Any small entity subject to this proposed regulation which determines that, because
of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic impact should notify the NRC of this in a comment
that indicates_

(a) The licensee's size in terms of annual income or revenue, number of employees and, if the licensee is a treatment
center, the number of beds and patients treated annually; 

(b) How the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee as compared to that
on a larger licensee; 

(c) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities;


(d) The benefits that would be gained or the detriments that would be avoided by the licensee if the proposed regulation
was modified as suggested by the commenter; and

(e) How the regulation, as modified, would still adequately protect the public health and safety. 



Backfit Analysis



Because 10 CFR parts 19 and 20 apply to all NRC licensees, any proposed changes to these parts must be evaluated to determine
if these changes constitute backfitting for reactor licensees such that the provisions of 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,''
apply. The following discussion addresses that evaluation.

The proposed rule consists of five changes: (1) Deletion of the definition and use of the term ``Controlled area,''
(2) deletion of the phrase ``in a restricted area or'' contained in the definition of occupational dose, (3) revising
the definition of ``Unrestricted area,'' (4) modification of the training requirement contained in 10 CFR 19.12,
and (5) restoring a requirement that individuals members of the public be notified when they are identified in reports
to NRC on exposures in excess of the limits. 

The deletion of the definition of controlled area is a corrective change. The term was originally added with the 1991
revision of part 20 to acknowledge the need for licensees to control access to areas for purposes other than radiation
protection. The use of the term was not intended to be mandatory. Numerous questions from licensees regarding implementing
Controlled areas have arisen. Since the staff believes that the use of a controlled area has no radiation protection
function other than potential use in estimating the occupancy time for demonstrating compliance with the 100 mrem/year
limit, it is being proposed that the term be deleted from part 20. 

For those reactor licensees who have already formally implemented the revised standards or who have a need for the
additional flexibility afforded by the use of the concept of controlled area for purposes of radiological protection,
the provisions for exemptions from the NRC's regulations provide an avenue of relief. The NRC currently believes
that the elimination of the concept of ``Controlled area'' will have such a small impact on most power reactor licensees
that it does not constitute a backfit as envisioned by 10 CFR 50.109. The action removes flexibility but does not directly
impose new procedures. However, the NRC welcomes comments on whether this action does in fact constitute a backfit,
the degree of burden imposed by the action, particularly for licensees who have already implemented the revised 10
CFR part 20, and on whether in the limited matter of ``Controlled area'' provisions for grandfathering should be provided
in the final rule to avoid such burdens. 

The deletion of the phrase ``in a restricted area or,'' contained in the definition of occupational dose is to ensure
that the Commission's intent to apply the dose limits of 10 CFR 20.1301 to members of the public regardless of their
physical location, is properly implemented. Currently, only workers are subject to the higher occupational dose
limits and just because a member of the public is permitted entry into a restricted area does not mean that he or she should
be allowed to receive an occupational dose and exceed the public dose limit. For this reason, the reference to a restricted
area is being removed from the definition of occupational dose. 

Revising the definition of ``Unrestricted area,'' would make the current staff position clear that for purposes
of radiation protection, areas are either restricted or unrestricted. This change is consistent with the former
10 CFR part 20 and conforms to removing ``Controlled area'' from the rule. 

The change to 10 CFR 19.12 will be consistent with the proposed revised definition of occupational exposure. Since
occupational dose is to be based upon the individual's activities involving radiation and/or radioactive materials,
rather than the location of the work (e.g., restricted area), a conforming change in part 19 is needed to ensure that
workers who receive an occupational dose are appropriately trained regardless of the physical location where the
work is performed. This is also needed so that members of the public, such as delivery persons, who occasionally enter
a restricted area will not be required to receive occupational training merely because they entered a restricted
area when their potential exposures do not exceed the 1 Msv (100 mrem) public dose limit and their activities, therefore,
would not subject them to any significant risk. 

The NRC staff believes that the impact of the change to 10 CFR 19.12 is negligible for 10 CFR part 50 licensees, given
that the expected numbers of additional occupationally exposed individuals requiring training is small relative
to the number of workers already receiving training at these facilities. The NRC staff also believes that these licensees
have been providing training to these individuals, even though not specifically required by the regulations. 

The addition of 10 CFR 20.2205, ``Reports to individuals of exceeding dose limits'' is considered to be the restoration
of a previous requirement. Section 20.409(b) of part 20 requires licensees to notify an individual worker or member
of the public whenever a report to the NRC is required regarding an exposure of the identified individual. This requirement
was inadvertently omitted from the revised standards. Although few incidents occur that involved exposure of a member
of the public in excess of dose limits, restoring this provision to part 20 will ensure that licensees are aware of their
obligation to notify the individual if, and when, they are required to submit a report to NRC of an occurrence that identifies
that individual as having received an exposure. 

The Commission believes that these proposed changes to 10 CFR part 20 will have some, albeit minor, impacts on reactor
licensees. Licensees who have already implemented the revised standards, or who have written procedures to do so,
will need to revise those procedures to reflect the proposed changes if promulgated. Benefits such as simplifying
the use of restricted and unrestricted area designation, making it clear that only workers can receive occupational
dose, tying training requirements to the potential to receive occupational exposure and ensuring that overexposed
individuals are notified, are considered by the Commission to far outweigh the impacts. However, these benefits
are qualitative in nature, and are expressed in terms of reduced uncertainty in regulatory requirements, clarity
of regulatory intent, and consistency of regulatory approach. Thus the NRC believes that the modifications proposed
are not backfits. However, the NRC invites comments from affected licensees on whether these proposed changes impose
significant burdens and whether or not the actions constitute a backfit.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints,
and repair, if necessary; reporting any findings of discrepancies; replacing certain countersunk fasteners with
protruding head fasteners; and verifying that the airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. This action
would increase the area to be inspected, delete the reporting requirement, and expand the applicability. This proposal
is prompted by reports of fuselage skin cracking in certain areas and findings of additional countersunk fasteners.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Comments Invited 


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-NM-183-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 


Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 93-NM-183-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion 


On December 19, 1989, the FAA issued AD 90-01-07, Amendment 39-6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990),
applicable to Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, having line numbers 201 through 765, inclusive, to require: 
1. Repetitively inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary; 
2. Reporting any findings of discrepancies; 
3. Replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding head fasteners; and 
4. Verifying that airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. 
That action was prompted by reports of cracking in the lap joint of stringer 34 near the interface with the wing-to-body
fairing. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent in-flight depressurization due to undetected cracks
in the skin of the airplane.

Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received additional reports of cracking in the upper row of countersunk fasteners
in the lap splice in the area adjacent to the wing-to-body fairing intersection on Model 747 series airplanes. Additionally,
several airplanes were found to have more than the necessary number of countersunk fasteners, which were installed
during production at the upper row of the lap splice at stringer 34. These countersunk fasteners were found in the upper
row of fasteners in the lap splice near the wing-to-body fairing and skin intersection between body station (BS) 768
and the circumferential skin joint at BS 741. 


Cracking in locations where countersunk fasteners were installed, if not corrected, could result in reduced structural
integrity of the fuselage. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 
747-53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992, that describes procedures for visually inspecting to determine
the number of countersunk fasteners in the upper row of the lap splice. 


If more than the necessary number of countersunk fasteners were installed during production, this service bulletin
specifies conducting an external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection to detect cracking in the skin lap
splices at the wing-to-body fairing intersection where countersunk fasteners were found in the upper row of fasteners.
If cracking is found, the service bulletin describes procedures for modifying the locations where countersunk fasteners
were found by replacing the countersunk fasteners with oversized protruding head fasteners and repairing the skin.
These actions were accomplished, prior to delivery, on airplanes having line numbers 815 through 919, inclusive.



If the proper number of countersunk fasteners were installed during production, repetitive inspections are specified
in the service bulletin until the locations where countersunk fasteners were installed have been modified. 


The service bulletin describes procedures for eventual modification of all airplanes at the location where countersunk
fasteners were installed, and repetitive inspections following modification. 


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90-01-07 to: 


1. Continue to require inspections to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary;



2. Require visual inspections to determine if countersunk fasteners had been installed between body stations (BS)
741 and 1000 at Stringers (S-)34L, S-34R, S-39L, S-39R, and S-44L, S-44R, and between
BS 1480 and 1741 at S-34L, S-34R, S-40L, and S-40R on airplanes having line numbers 201 through
814, inclusive; 


3. Require HFEC inspections to detect cracking at all locations where countersunk fasteners were found in the upper
row of the lap splice, and repair, if necessary; and 


4. Require modification of all locations where countersunk fasteners were found. 


Although the actions and compliance times of this proposed AD would differ from the manufacturer's recommendations
specified in the service bulletin, the actions themselves would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
the procedures of the service bulletin described previously. 


There are approximately 723 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD. 


The inspections that were previously required by AD 90-01-07, and retained in this AD, take approximately
14 workhours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910 or $770 per airplane,
per inspection cycle. 


The additional new inspections that would be required by this AD would take approximately 82 work hours per airplane
to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection
requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825,330, or $4,510 per airplane 


The modification required by this AD would take approximately 124 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,248,060, or $6,820 per airplane.



Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification requirements of this AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $2,214,300, or $11,407 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator
has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 


The FAA recognizes that the proposed modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the 20,000-flight cycle compliance time specified in paragraph (j) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for
the modification of all locations where countersunk fasteners were found to be accomplished coincidentally with
scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with
special airplane scheduling. 


The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is inviting comments on whether it should revise its regulations
governing the assessment of annual charges for the administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act and if so, what
changes might be appropriate. One alternative that the Commission is considering is to allocate the annual charges
for administrative costs among a single class of licensees and exemptees, based on the respective capacity of each
hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum and maximum charge, and with the assessments to commence
at the same time as the commencement of project construction. To ameliorate the potential impact on licensees and
exemptees, this alternative would include a transition period of several years for phasing-in the changes. Other
alternatives would include, but would not be limited to, retention of the current distinction between municipal
and non-municipal licensees including retention of the different formulae by which their respective annual charges
are allocated.

I. Introduction



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) invites comments on whether it should revise its regulations
governing the assessment of annual charges for the administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act (FPA),
 and if so, what changes might be appropriate. One alternative that the Commission is considering is to allocate the
annual charges for administrative costs among a single class of licensees and exemptees, based on the respective
capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum and maximum charge, and with the assessments
to commence at the same time as the commencement of project construction. To ameliorate the potential impact on licensees
and exemptees, this alternative would include a transition period of several years for phasing-in the changes. Other
alternatives would include, but would not be limited to, retention of the current distinction between municipal
and non-municipal licensees including retention of the different formulae by which their respective annual charges
are allocated.

II. Public Reporting Burden
 


Under the current regulations, major non-municipal licensees file annual reports containing data on their electric
generation during the prior fiscal year. If adopted, one alternative of the regulations discussed herein would eliminate
that reporting burden. 



III. Background



The Commission is required by section 10(e)(1) of the FPA

2

 to collect annual charges from licensees for the cost of administering Part I of the FPA. Part 11 of the Commission's
regulations

3

 provides the manner in which licensees are charged for such costs. Prior to the adoption of the current regulations
in 1958 and 1963, administrative charges were not based on the actual costs of the government, but were in the nature
of set fees that were billed for a calendar year.
 Under the current regulations, the reimbursable costs are determined on a fiscal year basis. 







Section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA)
 
requires the Commission to recover all of its costs for the 
fiscal year through annual charges and fees.
 The annual charges assessed pursuant to OBRA are based on an estimate of the Commission's current-fiscal-year costs,
with subsequent adjustments based on actual costs.
 Pursuant to OBRA, the Commission collects annual charges to recover the costs of administering parts II and III of
the FPA, as well as the costs the Commission incurs in administering the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act,
and the Interstate Commerce Act. In this regard, we note that section 3401(a)(2) of OBRA provides that ``[t]he provisions
of this subtitle shall not affect the authority, requirements, exceptions, or limitations in sections 10(e) and
30(e) of the Federal Power Act.'' 







IV. Discussion



A. Allocation Among Different Classes of Licensees
 


The existing  11.1 provides three different allocation formulae for three different classes of licensees.
For non-municipal licensees of projects of more than 2,000 horsepower of installed capacity,  11.1(a) sets
forth an allocation formula that is based on a combination of the project's authorized installed capacity and the
energy actually generated.

8

 For municipal licensees of projects of more than 2,000 horsepower,  11.1(b) sets forth an allocation formula
based solely on capacity.

9

 For all licensees (both municipal and non-municipal) of projects of 2,000 horsepower or less of installed capacity,
 11.1(c) specifies an annual charge of five cents per horsepower, with a minimum charge of $5 per year.

10

 







The Commission believes that the process of collecting data and assessing charges could be conducted more efficiently
if the allocation were based on a single formula, and questions whether any presently-valid purpose is served by perpetuating
the divergent formulae. Therefore, one alternative the Commission is considering is to use the same formula to allocate
the annual charges among a single pool of licensees that includes both municipal licensees (

i.e.

, those who are not fully exempt from annual charges) and non-municipal licensees, as well as minor licensees and (as
discussed below) exemptees. One variation of that alternative is to base that formula entirely on authorized installed
capacity. Another variation would be to base the formula entirely on generation. A third alternative would be to base
it on a combination of capacity and generation.

We recognize that using the same formula to allocate the annual charges among a single pool of licensees (and exemptees)
would cause a large increase, both in total dollars and percentage, that major municipal licensees as a group experience.
We solicit comment on this impact. One approach the Commission could consider (discussed below) would be the adoption
of a three-year transition period for phasing in the resulting cost changes. 
Changing the allocation formula from a mix of capacity and generation to capacity alone would reduce the Commission's
administrative burden as well as the reporting requirements of major non-municipal licensees. Under the current
system, the Commission obtains annual generation data from non-municipal project operators; delays in providing
this information to the Commission complicate the billing process. By using authorized installed capacity exclusively,
the Commission would always have the apportionment data on hand and the calculation of the bills would be simplified.

The Commission is also considering alternative formulae, such as an allocation based in whole or in part on generation
measured in kilowatt hours. In this regard, the Commission notes that the annual charges it assesses pursuant to OBRA
are all allocated among the regulated entities pursuant to a formula based on an appropriate measure of volume rather
than on a measure of capacity. OBRA requires the Commission to compute those annual charges based on methods which
the Commission determines to be ``fair and equitable.''

11

 Annual charges under Parts II and III of the FPA and related statutes are apportioned to public utilities based on the
data they submit with respect to megawatt-hours of adjusted sales for resale and adjusted coordination sales.

12

 Annual charges under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and related statutes are allocated among
natural gas pipeline companies based on the volumes of gas sold or transported by each company.

13

 Annual charges under the Interstate Commerce Act are allocated among oil pipelines based on their operating revenues.

14

 







With respect to the annual charges for the administration of part I of the FPA pursuant to section 10(e)(1) of the FPA,
the analog to allocation of the annual charges pursuant to OBRA would be an allocation scheme based on the electric
energy actually generated by the various licensed and exempted hydropower projects rather than on their respective
capacity to so generate. We are concerned, however, that the generation data reporting requirements necessary to
implement such a scheme may impose an undue burden on smaller licensees and exemptees. Accordingly, the Commission
invites comment on the propriety of using generation data rather than authorized capacity as the basis for allocating
the charges, and on whether such a scheme would be unduly burdensome on some or all licensees or exemptees. We specifically
invite comment from municipal and minor licensees as to whether they have equipment for measuring generation and
whether it would be burdensome to report such data to us. 
Another alternative that the Commission is considering to simplify the allocation process is to eliminate only the
third prong of the formula, and to include minor licensees in the respective allocation formulae for major licensees.
In other words, the minor municipal licensees would be included in the same allocation formula with the major municipal
licensees, and the minor non-municipal licensees would be included in the same allocation formula with the major
non-municipal licensees. The Commission could include exemptees in the same manner. This alternative would preserve
the existing use of a formula based on a combination of capacity and generation to determine the annual charges for
non-municipal licensees, and of a formula based solely on capacity to determine the annual charges for municipal
licensees. This alternative would avoid the large increase, both in total dollars and percentage, that major municipal
licensees as a group would experience under a single, unified formula. 
The Commission could provide a transition period for phasing in the assessments for minor licensees and exemptees.
The Commission specifically invites comment from minor licensees and exemptees on whether such a transition period
would be helpful or appropriate. 
In this regard, the Commission notes that the current system of categorizing municipal and non-municipal projects
separately for purposes of annual charges produces a sizeable disparity in the annual charges assessed for projects
of comparable size depending on their class of ownership. The disparity is illustrated by the data in the table in Appendix
A. 
Under the present regulations, and under the currently prevailing facts (which, as discussed below, can be expected
to change), the non-municipal licensees are assessed a substantially larger annual charge per kilowatt of capacity
than the municipal licensees. This is occurring primarily because the bulk of the Commission's current licensing
activities is focused on processing applications for new licenses for projects whose original licensees expired
in 1993. Since a disproportionate number of these projects are owned by non-municipal licensees, the effect of segregating
out the hours spent on those applications is to allocate more of the annual charges burden to the non-municipal licensees.
In other words, non-municipal licensees as a group are paying comparatively higher annual charges today than municipal
licensees because at this time the non-municipal licensees, as a group, are imposing comparatively greater regulatory
costs.

This is not to suggest, however, that the disproportionate charges are being assessed only to the non-municipal licensees
who have filed pending applications for a new license or who are presently involved in compliance proceedings. To
the contrary, the annual charge assessments for this work are allocated among all of the non-municipal licensees
as a class, and most of those licensees are neither seeking a new license nor involved in a compliance proceeding. 
Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that in some future year the shoe may shift to the other foot. On average, over
time, the licenses for municipal projects expire at the same frequency as the licenses for non-municipal projects,
and the frequency of compliance proceedings also tends to even out. Thus, given the current concentration of resources
on processing cases involving non-municipal projects, it is reasonable to assume that eventually some years will
occur in which there will be an equally disproportionate burden of annual charge assessments on municipal projects
vis-a-vis non-municipal projects. The net effect of the present categorization of costs according to the municipal/non-municipal
status of the project, therefore, is not to permanently favor either one class or the other, but to create swings_both
up and down_in the annual charges assessed to the two classes, depending on the particular mix of the Commission's
workload in any given year. The Commission welcomes comment on all of these matters. 
The Commission recognizes the possibility that the elimination of generation as a factor might have a significant
impact on some licensees, and welcomes comment on it. The Commission also recognizes that the charges for minor licensees
may increase substantially, but believes that the current charge of five cents per horsepower has been so heavily
eroded by inflation since it was adopted in 1963 as to have been rendered comparatively meaningless.
For instance, the table in Appendix A at the end of this NOPR shows the following illustrative examples of increases
in annual charges for minor licensees from the 1993 charge to the charge that would result from the amendments described
in the Alternative A regulatory text: 






In particular, the Commission welcomes comment on whether there are distinctions between municipal and non-municipal
projects that would justify the current difference in their allocation formulae or whether the substantial increases
in some licensees' annual charges that would result from eliminating this distinction are reason enough to retain
the distinction. 
The Commission recognizes that, in the case of major construction projects, the license may be in effect for several
years before project construction is commenced and before the project commences operation and goes into service.
With respect to non-municipal licensees, annual charges are payable each year from the date of issuance of the license
but there is no incoming stream of revenue during those years because no power is being generated. Municipal licensees,
on the other hand, do obtain an exemption from annual charges prior to and during the construction period because,
since they are not generating power during that period, they are not selling power for profit. This is because  11.6(g)
of the regulations provides a complete exemption from certain annual charges when a municipal project is under construction
and not generating power, on the theory that the project is operating without profit within the meaning of the municipal
exemption in FPA section 10(e).

Under the various regulatory regimes discussed herein, the Commission would maintain the above-described exemption
from annual charges with respect to municipal projects that have not yet commenced commercial operation. In addition,
the Commission proposes to include in the assessment formula (whatever it may be) only licensed and exempted projects
that have already been constructed or whose construction has commenced. Although framed in terms of all projects,
as a practical matter, because of the exemption for municipal projects, the change would primarily affect non-municipal
projects. 
We believe that commencement of construction is a more appropriate determinant than completion of construction,
for two reasons. First of all, the date on which construction commenced is a legally precise, documented date

15-16

 whereas the date on which construction is completed is not defined with the same precision. Secondly, it is our understanding
that licensees of projects under construction can draw on construction loan funds to pay the annual charges whereas
such funds may not be available prior to the commencement of construction. 




The Commission also proposes to establish a minimum and maximum annual charge. The minimum annual charge would be
$100.

17

 We believe that $100 is a reasonable charge for a regulated project to pay, to participate in defraying the cost of administration
of the hydropower regulatory program, regardless of how small the project's capacity may be.

18

 





The Commission also proposes to set a limit on annual charges so that, with respect to costs incurred by the Commission,
no licensee's project would be required to pay more than 2.0 percent of the total costs. We believe that a maximum charge
is appropriate to avoid having a small number of projects bearing most of the Commission's costs of administration.
The proposed limit is modelled after the formula in  382.203(b) with respect to annual charges for oil pipelines.
The maximum annual charge stated therein is 6.339 percent of the total charges, but that figure is based on a much smaller
number of significant entities (interstate oil pipelines) sharing a much smaller total cost. 
With respect to a minimum charge, other alternatives would be to waive charges below a fixed dollar amount or below
a fixed capacity. With respect to a maximum charge, different percentages could be used for the ceiling. If the formula
were to be based solely on capacity, another alternative would be to have a 50 percent discount for all authorized capacity
above a prescribed ceiling (

e.g.,

 500 megawatts). In this example, if a project had an authorized capacity of 1000 megawatts, it would be counted in the
apportionment formula as 750 megawatts (all of the first 500 megawatts plus half of the second 500 megawatts). The
Commission invites comments on these and other potential alternatives. 
The Commission notes that adoption of some of the alternatives discussed herein might increase the annual charges
for certain pumped storage projects. Nevertheless there are other features (such as the start-of-construction
date and the maximum charge) that would benefit some pumped storage projects, to the extent that large pumped storage
projects have extended design and construction periods and comparatively massive capacity.

We have included in this notice of proposed rulemaking two alternative examples of the regulatory text that might
be used to implement the various alternative proposals discussed herein. The ``Alternative A'' regulatory text
is based on the allocation of all of the annual charges among a single class of licensees and exemptees, including all
major and minor municipal and non-municipal licensees and all exemptees. The allocation is based solely on the respective
capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts. 
The ``Alternative B'' regulatory text retains the current separate categories and formulae for major municipal
and non-municipal licensees. Minor licensees and exemptees would be classified with the comparable groups of major
licensees and their charges would be assessed pursuant to the formulae currently used for those groups. 
Both the ``Alternative A'' and ``Alternative B'' regulatory texts implement a minimum charge of $100 and a maximum
charge of two percent of the total of all charges. Under both alternatives, assessments would not commence prior to
the commencement of project construction.

19

 




B. Transition Arrangements 


While the Commission believes that many of the regulatory amendments discussed above would in the long run render
the regulations more rational and more fair and equitable, the Commission also recognizes that if these amendments
were to be adopted en masse at a single stroke they might impose significant unanticipated burdens on some licensees
and exemptees. Therefore, the Commission proposes a three-year transition period for phasing-in some of the changes
it might adopt, particularly with respect to the changes described in the ``Alternative A'' regulatory text. 
Charges during the transition described therein would be calculated by the following steps. First, the difference
between a project's charge using the current method and the proposed method would be divided into fourths. The charge
for the first transition year would be the current method charge plus the one-fourth increment. (If the charge is reduced
in going from the current method to the proposed method, the one-fourth increment would be subtracted.)

20

 The charge for the second transition year would be the current method charge plus (or minus) the two-fourths increment.
The charge for the third transition year would be the current method charge plus (or minus) the three-fourths increment.
The charge for the fourth year would be calculated solely by the proposed method.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940203-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940203-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The charges in all of these transition years, however, would be subject to the proposed minimum and maximum charges.
 In addition, in all of these transition years, charges would be assessed only with respect to hydropower projects
that have been constructed or whose construction has commenced.
 






Finally, as discussed above, if the major changes have their most significant impact only on minor licensees and exemptees,
a transition period could be established solely for those entities. 


C. From Horsepower to Kilowatts 


As discussed above, the existing regulations at  11.1 provide different allocation formulae for municipal
and non-municipal projects of more than 2,000 horsepower of installed capacity. Both formulae, however, take into
account a project's authorized installed capacity defined in terms of horsepower. 
The computation of a project's capacity in terms of horsepower likely arose in the earlier years of the Commission's
regulatory oversight, when the then-existing projects included a greater percentage of hydromechanical equipment.
 Today, however, the determination of a hydroelectric project's authorized capacity is generally stated in terms
of kilowatts; that is the manner in which authorized capacity is stated in the licenses.
 In fact, the Commission's staff determines a project's horsepower capacity by converting kilowatts into horsepower.
Therefore, the Commission proposes to revise  11.1 to substitute kilowatts for horsepower in stating a project's
authorized installed capacity. 





For the few licensed hydromechanical projects, all of which are quite small, the Commission would impute a kilowatt
figure by multiplying these projects' existing horsepower capacity by three-fourths. We believe that using kilowatts
as the standard and converting the few hydromechanical project capacities into an imputed kilowatt capacity is far
easier than converting all of the hydroelectric project capacities from kilowatts to horsepower. 


D. The Determination of Authorized Installed Capacity 


Questions have occasionally arisen as to how to define ``authorized installed capacity.'' What if the capacity of
the generator exceeds the capacity of the turbine? What if the available stream flow is insufficient to fully utilize
the capacity of the turbine and generator installed in the project?
 




The Commission proposes to take this occasion to clarify the concept of ``authorized installed capacity'' by defining
it. The authorized installed capacity would be expressed in kilowatts, and would be the lesser of the capacity of the
generator or the turbine. Thus, if the capacity of the generator exceeded the capacity of the turbine, then the capacity
of the turbine would apply, and vice-versa. The availability of stream flow, however, would not be considered.
 




The capacity would be based on the actual power of the equipment in question without regard to whatever ``nameplate''
rating might be physically affixed to the unit (although, with respect to a new or unmodified unit, the ``nameplate
rating'' may well coincide with the definition proposed herein). If the generator or turbine are subsequently modified,
such as by rewinding the generator, the capacity would be recalculated accordingly. 
We believe that the proposed definition provides a means of determining capacity that is both workable and fair. The
capacity of the generator and the turbine are reasonably ascertainable, and do not involve the potential complexities
and controversies inherent in determining the availability of usable stream flow. If a project operator, for whatever
reason, chose to purchase, install or operate equipment whose capacity exceeded the available stream flow needed
to operate it, the operator would have to accept the consequence of having that equipment's capacity used as the basis
for determining the project's annual charges. 


E. The Five Megawatt and Conduit Exemption Costs 


Section 30 of the FPA
 provides that the Commission may exempt from the FPA's licensing provisions any facility (other than a dam, and within
certain megawatt limits) which is constructed or operated to generate electric power, if the facility is located
on non-federal land and ``utilizes for such generation only the hydroelectric potential of a manmade conduit, which
is operated for the distribution of water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption and not primarily
for the generation of electricity.''




Sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), as amended by section 408 of the
Energy Security Act of 1980,
 provide that the Commission may exempt from the FPA's licensing requirements small hydroelectric power projects
that are located at the site of an existing dam (or utilize natural water features without the need for a dam) and that
have a proposed installed capacity of five megawatts (MW) or less.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission's staff, however, performs similar safety and environmental compliance functions with respect
to hydroelectric projects that are operated pursuant to a 5 MW or conduit exemption as it does for projects that are
operated pursuant to a license. The Commission also incurs costs in processing exemption applications. Therefore,
as a matter of policy, the Commission believes that it would be appropriate for projects that are operated pursuant
to the 5 MW exemption to share the cost of the Commission's application and compliance programs, and that the same principle
applies as well with respect to conduit exemptions. 

Section 10(e) of the FPA provides that ``the licensee shall pay * * * annual charges * * *
for the costs of the administration of this Part * * *'' (emphasis added). We believe that this statutory
language may preclude imposition of annual charges on 5 MW and conduit exemptees under section 10(e) of the FPA. It
is arguable that such exemptees could not be construed as ``licensees'' within the meaning of section 10(e). The Commission
believes, however, that it has the legal authority under OBRA to assess annual charges to exemptees,

29

 and proposes to do so with respect to both the 5 MW and the conduit exemptions.

30

 





Finally, pursuant to  381.601, the Commission currently imposes a filing fee for applications for a 5 MW exemption.
The fee is based on the cost of processing all 5 MW exemption applications received each year divided by the number of
applications that the Commission has completed processing in that year. At present, the fee established by  381.601
is $21,620. Because the Commission is proposing to assess annual charges on 5 MW exemptees, the Commission proposes
to delete  381.601 from the regulations.

31

 




F. Other Revisions to Annual Charges 


Section 11.1(d) currently states that the minimum annual charge for projects involving transmission lines will
be $5. The Commission's current practice, however, is to state that charge in the articles of the individual licenses,
as appropriate. Therefore, we propose to conform the text of  11.1(d) to that practice. 
In its current form,  11.20 provides two separate deadlines for payment of bills for annual charges: 30 days
for headwater benefits bills and 45 days for other annual charges bills. The purpose of this distinction is not readily
apparent. Therefore, the Commission proposes to make all such bills payable upon 30 days of their rendition. 
There has also been some confusion over the procedures that a licensee should follow if it believes that the bill is
incorrect. The proposed new  11.20 provides for licensees to file an appeal of the bill to the Commission's Chief
Financial Officer. All decisions of the Chief Financial Officer on appeals would be subject to rehearing by the Commission
pursuant to  385.713. This would essentially codify the current informal practice. Most billing disputes
involve mathematical calculations that can be readily resolved by discussion with the Commission's staff without
the need for a formal request to the Commission for rehearing. 
The bill would still have to be paid within 30 days of its rendition in order to avoid the assessment of penalty payments
under  11.21, but if a timely appeal or request for rehearing is filed the bill could be paid under protest and
subject to refund. This provision would codify the Commission's current practice. 
As currently in effect,  11.6(i) requires that applications for exemptions from payment of annual charges
``shall be prepared on forms prescribed by the Commission * * *.'' Inasmuch as the Commission does
not currently prescribe such forms, the reference to such forms will be deleted.

We also propose to add a sentence at the end of  11.6(i) to clarify that bills for annual charges can be paid under
protest and subject to refund in the event that an application for an exemption from payment is pending when the bill
becomes payable. This provision would codify the Commission's current practice. 



V. Regulatory Flexibility Certification
 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)

32

 generally requires a description and analysis of proposed regulations that will have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.
 Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed herein will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 






VI. Environmental Statement
 


Issuance of this notice of proposed rulemaking does not constitute a major federal action having a significant adverse
impact on the quality of the human environment under the Commission's regulations implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act.

34

 The regulations proposed herein are procedural in nature and therefore fall within the categorical exemptions provided
in the Commission's regulations. Consequently, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental
assessment is required.

35

 






VII. Information Collection Statement
 


The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information
and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements that would be deleted
by this proposed rule are contained in FERC-583 ``Annual Kilowatt Generating Report (Annual Charges)'' (1902-0136).
The Commission's Financial Services Division uses the data for determination of the amount of annual charges to be
assessed licensees for reimbursable government administrative costs. If the amendments proposed herein are adopted,
the Commission would submit to the OMB a notification that these collections of information have been modified. 

Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208-1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. 



VIII. Public Comment Procedures



The Commission invites all interested persons to submit written comments on the matters discussed in this notice
of proposed rulemaking. An original and 14 copies of the written comments must be filed with the Commission April 4,
1994. Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, during regular business hours, and should refer to Docket No. RM93-7-000.


All written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's
Public Reference Room, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street North East, Washington, DC 20426 during regular business
hours. 



List of Subjects 



18 CFR Part 11 



Electric power, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 



18 CFR Part 381 



Electric power plants, Electric utilities, Natural gas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission invites comment on the potential amendments to 18 CFR parts 11 and
381 that are set forth below in two alternative versions (styled as ``Alternative A'' and ``Alternative B''), and
also invites comments on any other potential alternatives.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, 18 CFR parts 11 and 381 are proposed to be amended in the alternative as follows:
 


Alternative A 



PART 11_ANNUAL CHARGES UNDER PART I OF THE FEDERAL POWER ACT 



1. The authority citation for Part ll continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 16 U.S.C. 791a-825r; 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352. 




2. Section 11.1 is revised to read as follows: 



 11.1 

Costs of administration. 



(a) 

Authority.

 Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986,
the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States
for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program. 

(b) 

Scope.

 The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among:
 
(1) all licensees; 

(2) all holders of exemptions under section 30 of the Federal Power Act; and 

(3) all holders of exemptions under sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended
by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980. 

(c) 

Formula.

 A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act,
from which shall be deducted administrative costs fixed in the licenses and exemptions and those fixed by the Commission
in determining headwater benefit payments. For each fiscal year, the costs of administration will be assessed against
each licensee and exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the total
of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions. The annual charge factor for each
such project shall be its authorized installed capacity as measured in kilowatts. The assessments will include all
such licensed and exempted projects that have been constructed, and all such licensed and exempted projects whose
construction has been commenced. In the event that construction commences during a fiscal year, the charges will
be prorated based on the day on which construction commenced. 

(d) 

Municipal exemptions.

 (1) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees
and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptees for State or municipal purposes,
each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under
oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof
during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours: 

(i) Gross amount of power generated by the project. 

(ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc. 

(iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows: 

(A) Used by licensee or exemptee. 

(B) Sold by licensee or exemptee. 

(2) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system,
making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power,
such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the
available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee. 

(e) 

Transmission lines.

 For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license. 

(f) 

Minimum and maximum charges.

 (1) The minimum annual charge under this section will be $100 per year for each licensed or exempted project, subject
to reduction based on partial or total exemption pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. 

(2) No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission
to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project
with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum
charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment
will be computed using the method outlined in paragraph (c) of this section (but excluding any project whose annual
charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge exceeds
the maximum charge. 

(g) 

Commission's costs.

 (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate
of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which
the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the
costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to
the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment
to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year. 

(2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the
bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year
1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal
years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the
Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges
and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996.

(h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act,
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that
were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews
pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act. 

(i) 

Definition. 

As used in paragraph (c) of this section, 

authorized installed capacity

 means the lesser of the ratings of the generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load
capacity rating of the generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee
or exemptee does not know its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product
of the turbine's capacity in horsepower (hp) at maximum head gate opening under the manufacturer's rating head times
a conversion factor of 0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized
in the license or exemption, or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the
turbine is modified to change its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized
installed capacity to reflect the change. 

(j) 

Transition rules. 

(1) For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity
shall be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.


(2) During the first three fiscal years in which annual charges are assessed after [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE
BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the annual charges will be determined as follows. The assessments will include (and be limited
to) all licenses and exempted projects that have been constructed or whose construction has been commenced, and will
be subject to the minimum and maximum charges specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Subject to those parameters,
the Commission will determine the charge that would have been assessed pursuant to the regulations in effect prior
to [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the charge that would have been assessed pursuant to the
regulations in effect subsequent to that date, and the difference between those two assessments. In the first fiscal
year after [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the Commission will adjust the assessment that
would otherwise be payable under the regulations in effect after that date by an amount equal to 75 percent of the difference
between the amount that would have been payable under the regulations that were previously in effect and the amount
that would have been payable under those regulations after they were amended. In the second fiscal year after [INSERT
DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the Commission will adjust the assessment by 50 percent of that difference.
In the third fiscal year after [INSERT DATE ON WHICH THE FINAL RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE], the Commission will adjust
the assessment by 25 percent of the difference. 

3. In  11.6, the title, the introductory sentence of paragraph (a), and paragraph (i), are revised, and the cross-reference
at the end of the section is removed, to read as follows: 



 11.6 

Exemption of State and municipal licensees and exemptees. 



(a) 

Bases for exemption. 

A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges
upon one or more of the following grounds: 



* * * * * 



(i) 

Application for exemption. 

Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief
accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. An original and three copies of such application
shall be filed with the Commission within the time allowed (by  11.28) for the payment of the annual charges.
If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends
to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the
application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement
to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under  11.21.
If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application
is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund. 

4. Section 11.20 is revised to read as follows: 


 11.20 

Time for payment. 



Annual charges must be paid no later than 30 days after rendition of a bill by the Commission. If the licensee or exemptee
believes that the bill is incorrect, no later than 30 days after its rendition the licensee or exemptee may file an appeal
of the bill with the Chief Financial Officer. No later than 30 days after the date of issuance of the Chief Financial
Officer's decision on the appeal, the licensee or exemptee may file a request for rehearing of that decision pursuant
to  385.713 of this chapter. In the event that a timely appeal to the Chief Financial Officer or a timely request
to the Commission for rehearing is filed, the payment of the bill may be made under protest, and subject to refund pending
the outcome of the appeal or rehearing.

PART 11_ANNUAL CHARGES UNDER PART I OF THE FEDERAL POWER ACT 



1. The authority citation for part 11 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 16 U.S.C. 791a-825r; 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352. 




2. Section 11.1 is revised to read as follows:



 11.1 

Costs of administration. 



(a) 

Authority.

 Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986,
the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States
for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program. 

(b) 

Scope.

 The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among: 

(1) All licensees; 

(2) All holders of exemptions under section 30 of the Federal Power Act; and 

(3) All holders of exemptions under sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended
by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980. The assessments will include all such licensed and exempted projects
that have been constructed, and all such licensed and exempted projects whose construction has been commenced. In
the event that construction commences during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated based on the day on which construction
commenced. 

(c) 

Licenses and exemptions other than State or municipal.

 For licensees and exemptees, other than State or municipal: 

(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act
chargeable to such licensees or exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated
in the license or exemption or fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments. 

(2) For each fiscal year the costs of administration determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assessed
against such licensee or exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the
total of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions. 

(3) The annual charge factor for each such project shall be found as follows: 

(i) For a conventional project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 150 times its annual energy output
in millions of kilowatt-hours. 

(ii) For a pure pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity. 

(iii) For a mixed conventional-pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 150 times
its gross annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours less 100 times the annual energy used for pumped storage
pumping in millions of kilowatt-hours. 

(iv) For purposes of determining their annual charges factor, projects that are operated pursuant to an exemption
or whose authorized installed capacity does not exceed 1.5 megawatts will be deemed to have an annual energy output
of zero. 

(4) To enable the Commission to determine such charges annually, each licensee whose authorized installed capacity
exceeds 1.5 megawatts must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing
the gross amount of power generated (or produced by nonelectrical equipment) and the amount of power used for pumped
storage pumping by the project during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt hours. If any licensee does
not report the gross energy output of its project within the time specified above, the Commission's staff will estimate
the energy output and this estimate may be used in lieu of the filings required by this section made by such licensee
after November 1. 

(d) 

State and municipal licensees and exemptees.

 For State or municipal licensees and exemptees: 

(1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the cost of administration under Part I of the Federal Power
Act chargeable to such licensees and exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated
in the license or exemption or that are fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments. 

(2) An exemption will be granted to a licensee or exemptee to the extent, if any, to which it may be entitled under section
10(e) of the Act provided the data is submitted as requested in paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this section. 

(3) For each fiscal year the total actual cost of administration as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section
will be assessed against each such licensee or exemptee (except to the extent of the exemptions granted pursuant to
paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the proportion that the authorized installed capacity of each such project bears
to the total such capacity under all such outstanding licenses or exemptions. 

(4) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees
and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptees for State or municipal purposes,
each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under
oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof
during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours: 

(i) Gross amount of power generated by the project. 

(ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc.
 
(iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows: 

(A) Used by licensee or exemptee.

(B) Sold by licensee or exemptee. 

(5) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system,
making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power,
such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the
available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee. 

(e) 

Transmission lines.

 For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license. 

(f) 

Minimum and maximum charges.

 (1) The minimum annual charge under this section will be $100 per year for each licensed or exempted project, subject
to reduction based on partial or total exemption pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 

(2) No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission
to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project
with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum
charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment
will be computed using the method outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (but excluding any project whose
annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge
exceeds the maximum charge. 

(g) 

Commission's costs.

 (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate
of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which
the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the
costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to
the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment
to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year. 

(2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the
bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year
1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal
years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the
Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges
and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. 

(h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act,
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that
were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews
pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act. 

(i) 

Definition.

 As used in paragraph (c) of this section, ``authorized installed capacity'' means the lesser of the ratings of the
generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load capacity rating of the
generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee or exemptee does not know
its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product of the turbine's capacity
in horsepower (hp) at maximum head gate opening under the manufacturer's rating head times a conversion factor of
0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized in the license or exemption,
or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the turbine is modified to change
its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized installed capacity to reflect
the change. 

(j) 

Transition.

 For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity shall
be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.

 11.6 

Exemption of State and municipal licensees and exemptees. 



(a) 

Bases for exemption.

 A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges
upon one or more of the following grounds: 



* * * * *



(i) 

Application for exemption.

 Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief
accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. An original and three copies of such application
shall be filed with the Commission within the time allowed (by  11.28) for the payment of the annual charges.
If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends
to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the
application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement

If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application
is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund. 

4. Section 11.20 is revised to read as follows: 



 11.20 

Time for payment. 



Annual charges must be paid no later than 30 days after rendition of a bill by the Commission. If the licensee or exemptee
believes that the bill is incorrect, no later than 30 days after its rendition the licensee or exemptee may file an appeal
of the bill with the Chief Financial Officer. No later than 30 days after the date of issuance of the Chief Financial
Officer's decision on the appeal, the licensee or exemptee may file a request for rehearing of that decision pursuant
to  385.713 of this chapter. In the event that a timely appeal to the Chief Financial Officer or a timely request
to the Commission for rehearing is filed, the payment of the bill may be made under protest, and subject to refund pending
the outcome of the appeal or rehearing.

Appendix A 





Note:

 This Appendix will not be published in the Code of Federal Regulations.





The table in Appendix A shows illustrative annual charges for representative municipal and non-municipal licensees
and exemptees. It is based on the regulatory scheme described in the Alternative A regulatory text at the end of the
NOPR. Thus, the table is based on allocation of all of the annual charges among a single class of licensees and exemptees,
including all major and minor municipal and non-municipal licensees and all exemptees. The allocation is based solely
on the respective capacity of each hydropower project as measured in kilowatts, with a minimum charge of $100 and a
maximum charge of two percent of the total of all charges. Assessments would not commence prior to the commencement
of project construction. Finally, the table reflects the charges as they would become due over a three-year phase-in
period.

Peanut Butter: Proposed Amendment of Standard of Identity 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend the standard of identity for peanut butter to remove the
statement that added vitamins are not suitable ingredients of this food. If this change is adopted, manufacturers
will be able to add vitamins to make modified peanut butter in accordance with the agency's general definition and
standard of identity for food named by the use of a nutrient content claim (such as ``reduced fat'' or ``reduced calorie'')
and a standardized term (peanut butter). FDA is proposing to take this action because it tentatively finds that providing
for modified forms of peanut butter will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Thus, the agency
tentatively concludes that this action will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2431), FDA adopted  130.10 (21 CFR 130.10). This regulation provides for the use of nutrient
content claims defined in part 101 (21 CFR part 101), such as ``fat free,'' ``low calorie,'' or ``light,'' in conjunction
with a traditional standardized food name (e.g., ``sour cream'') to define a new food such as ``reduced fat sour cream.''
The purpose of the new general standard of identity is to provide for modified versions of certain standardized foods
and thereby to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.
The general standard of identity in  130.10 requires, among other things, that the modified versions of the
standardized foods: (1) Not be nutritionally inferior to the traditional standardized food, (2) possess performance
characteristics, such as physical properties, flavor characteristics, functional properties, and shelf life,
that are similar to those of the traditional standardized food, (3) contain a significant amount of any mandatory
ingredient required to be in the traditional food, and (4) be made from the same types of ingredients as permitted in
the standard for the traditional food, except that ingredients may be used to improve texture, prevent syneresis,
add flavor, extend shelf life, improve appearance, or add sweetness. Section 130.10(d)(5) also provides for the
use of water and fat analogs to replace fat and calories but specifically prohibits the replacement of required ingredients
of standardized foods with ingredients from a different source. For example, vegetable oil may not replace milkfat
in the manufacture of a modified version of sour cream. Furthermore,  130.10(d)(3) of the general standard
of identity prohibits the use in the modified food of any ingredient or component of an ingredient whose use in the traditional
food is specifically prohibited by the standard of identity for that food (21 CFR parts 131 through 169). 
In the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993, in a document entitled ``Food Labeling Regulations Implementing the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990; Opportunity for Comments'' (58 FR 2066) (hereinafter referred to as the ``implementation final rule''),
FDA provided an opportunity for comment on technical issues raised by the final regulations on food labeling that
it published on that date, including  130.10. The implementation final rule, among other things, provided
30 days for the submission of comments on technical issues.
In response to the implementation final rule, the agency received several inquiries regarding ingredients whose
use in modified foods is prohibited under  130.10(d)(3) of the general standard. Comments claimed that this
provision is inconsistent with  130.10(b), which requires that nutrients be added to the new food to restore
nutrient levels so that the new food is not nutritionally inferior to the traditional food. One comment suggested
that FDA amend  130.10(d)(3) by adding an exception to allow for compliance with  130.10(b). This comment
contended that without such an exception, no nutritionally improved versions of important products such as peanut
butter would be permitted, except when labeled as imitations.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 18, 1993, FDA published a final rule entitled ``Food Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims, General Principles,
Petitions, Definition of Terms; Definitions of Nutrient Content Claims for Fat, Fatty Acids, and Cholesterol content
of Foods; Food Standards: Requirements for Foods Named by Use of a Nutrient Content Claim and a Standardized Term;
Technical Amendment'' (58 FR 44020) (hereinafter referred to as ``the technical amendment''). In this document,
the agency acknowledged that it was arguable that there was a conflict between  130.10(b) and (d)(3) (58 FR 44020
at page 44028) but stated that no conflict between these provisions was intended. It recognized, however, that while
the need to ensure that the modified food is consistent in characteristics with the traditional standardized food
in as many ways as possible, and the need to ensure that the modified food is not made with ingredients not permitted
in the traditional food, normally support each other, in the case of peanut butter, and only peanut butter, they work
to prevent the creation of modified peanut butter products.
The standard of identity for peanut butter in  164.150(c) (21 CFR 164.150(c)) states that artificial flavorings,
artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, added vitamins, and color additives are not suitable ingredients
for use in the food. Based on testimony at the hearings held when the standard of identity for peanut butter was adopted
and the resulting findings of fact (33 FR 10506 at 10509, July 24, 1968), the agency adopted this prohibition on the
addition of vitamins to peanut butter because such addition is unnecessary when the peanut butter is consumed as part
of a balanced diet. As a result of the prohibition on vitamin addition in the peanut butter standard ( 164.150(c)),
it may not be possible to formulate a modified peanut butter product that is not nutritionally inferior to peanut butter
under the general standard of identity. For example, if the level of vitamins is reduced in making the modified peanut
butter product, e.g., a ``reduced calorie'' or ``reduced fat'' peanut butter, vitamins would have to be added to ensure
compliance with  130.10(b). 
In the technical amendment, the agency discussed the appropriateness of amending the standard of identity for peanut
butter to remove the specific prohibition regarding the addition of vitamins in  164.150(c) as well as the appropriateness
of the option suggested in comments of modifying  130.10 to allow the addition of nutrients to modified peanut
butter products (58 FR 44020 at 44028 and 44029). FDA stated that it was the agency's preliminary view that it is more
appropriate to amend the standard of identity for peanut butter to remove the specific prohibition regarding the
addition of vitamins than to modify  130.10. FDA said that amendment of the peanut butter standard would accomplish
the same result as the suggested modification of  130.10 but would allow the general standard of identity to
remain a generic standard applicable to any standardized food. FDA is now proposing to amend  164.150(c) to
effect this change. 
The agency points out that FDA's regulations make provision for nonstandardized spreadable peanut products. Under
 102.23 (21 CFR 102.23), these products may be labeled with the common or usual name ``peanut spreads,'' provided
that the identity statement contains a statement of the percent of peanut ingredient, and the product complies with
the nutrient content requirements in  102.23. This regulation has not, however, fostered a large number of
products.
FDA believes that amendment of the peanut butter standard to remove the prohibition on added vitamins will lead to
the creation of more peanut products than has been the case under  102.23 because manufacturers will be able
to use the term ``peanut butter'' instead of ``peanut spread'' in the names of their products. Further, FDA believes
that the use of defined nutrient content claims will promote uniformity in labeling and will enhance consumer recognition
of modified peanut butter products that have been designed to achieve a nutritional goal. This enhanced recognition
will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Thus, FDA tentatively finds that a change in the
peanut butter standard that will permit the use of added vitamins in the production of modified peanut butter products
is in the best interest of consumers. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to revise  164.150(c) by removing the specific
prohibition regarding ``added vitamins.'' This change will allow the addition of nutrients normally present in
peanut butter that would otherwise be reduced in manufacturing the modified peanut butter products, thereby ensuring
that the modified version of the food will not be nutritionally inferior to peanut butter. 
FDA notes that the removal of the specific prohibition against added vitamins in the peanut butter standard does not
change the agency's position that added vitamins are not necessary for peanut butter that has not been modified when
it is consumed in a balanced diet. Thus, if vitamins were added to a food that complies with the standard of identity
in  164.150, the resultant food would not be peanut butter. 


II. Economic Impact


FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health, and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The
Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. The proposed
removal of the specific prohibition regarding added vitamins in the peanut butter standard of identity will not affect
the manufacture or labeling of peanut butter as defined in  164.150. However, it will provide an additional
option to manufacturers of spreadable peanut products that do not comply with the standard of identity for peanut
butter. It will permit the manufacture and labeling of some modified peanut butter products in accordance with the
general definition and standard of identity in  130.10. Products complying with the general definition and
standard of identity may be named by use of a nutrient content claim and the standardized term ``peanut butter,'' thereby
minimizing confusion to consumers regarding the nature of the food. 
Because the manufacture of modified peanut butter products complying with the new general definition and standard
of identity is optional, and manufacturers may continue to make nonstandardized spreadable peanut products in accordance
with the common or usual name regulation in  102.23 and peanut butter in accordance with the standard of identity
in  164.150, FDA does not believe that the proposed change to remove the specific prohibition regarding ``added
vitamins'' in the standard of identity will have any adverse economic impact on manufacturers. Therefore, FDA finds
that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. In addition, FDA
certifies in accordance with section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that no significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities will derive from this action.


III. Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


IV. Comments


Interested persons may, on or before April 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 164


Food grades and standards, Nuts, Peanuts.
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs and redelegated to the Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, it is proposed that 21 CFR
part 164 be amended as follows:


PART 164_TREE NUT AND PEANUT PRODUCTS


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 164 is revised to read as follows:





Authority: 

 Secs. 201, 401, 403, 409, 701, 721 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 341, 343, 348, 371, 379e).



2. Section 164.150 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows:


 164.150 

 Peanut butter.


* * * * *


(c) The seasoning and stabilizing ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are suitable substances
which are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), or if
they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section
409 of the act. Seasoning and stabilizing ingredients that perform a useful function are regarded as suitable, except
that artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, and color additives are not suitable
ingredients in peanut butter. Oil products used as optional stabilizing ingredients shall be hydrogenated vegetable
oils. For the purposes of this section, hydrogenated vegetable oil shall be considered to include partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil.

Termination of Tenancy for Criminal Activity 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would provide that any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful
enjoyment of the premises by other tenants; any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful
enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises; or any drug-related
criminal activity on or near such premises, engaged in by a tenant, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest
or other person under the tenant's control would be grounds for termination of tenancy. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule would amend regulations for certain section 8 project-based assistance programs to provide that
a section 8 family may be evicted for drug crimes or for criminal activity that threatens other residents. Eviction
may be based on such criminal activity by a household member, a guest or another person under the tenant's control.



For existing housing under the section 8 Loan Management Program (24 CFR part 886, subpart A) and section 8 Property
Disposition Program (24 CFR part 886, subpart C), the proposed rule would implement section 8 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(d)(1)(B)(iii)), as amended by section 546 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National
Affordable Housing Act and section 145 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. 
At present, HUD's Multifamily Model Lease (Handbook 4350.3 Appendix 19a) contains similar provisions allowing
eviction for drug-related criminal activities or criminal activity that threatens other residents. 
This proposed rule would revise 24 CFR parts 247, 880, 881 and 883. The proposed rule would apply to evictions under
the section 8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation programs and under the section 8 Loan Management and
Property Disposition Programs. This proposed rule also would cover the following subsidized projects subject to
24 CFR part 247: multifamily housing projects that receive the benefit of subsidy in the form of below-market interest
rates under sections 221(d)(3) and (5); interest reduction payments under section 236 of the National Housing Act,
including Rental Assistance Payments (RAP); below-market interest rate direct loans under section 202 of the Housing
Act of 1959; rental subsidy in the form of rent supplement payments under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1965; section 8 in connection with section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped (24 CFR part 885),
the section 8 Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages (24 CFR part 886,
subpart A) and the section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (24 CFR part 886,
subpart C).

The proposed rule would be applied uniformly to all assisted housing tenants for the programs listed above. The rule
proposes to add criminal activity, including drug-related criminal activity, as grounds for termination of tenancy.
The existing requirement that an owner not evict any tenant, except by judicial action pursuant to State or local law
and in accordance with the Department's regulations and its due process procedures, will remain in effect. 

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(c), of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321


et seq

. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays
in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act 




The Secretary, in approving this proposed rule for publication, certifies in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. There are no small entities that would be impacted by this proposed rule. 




Executive Order 




This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning
and Review. Any changes made to the proposed rule as result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file,
which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh
Street SW., Washington, DC. 




Semiannual Agenda 




This proposed rule was listed as item 1514 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56404, 56424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and was requested by
and submited to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance
and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Act. 




Family Impact 




The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that, while
this proposed rule should increase the safety and security of families living in assisted housing, the proposed rule
does not have potential, direct, significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being;
therefore, it is not subject to review under this order. 




Federalism 




The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule would not have significant federalism implications and thus, are
not subject to review under the order. This proposed rule will not interfere with or preempt State or local government
functions.

Assisted Living Facilities Under Section 232 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule proposes to amend the regulations to implement statutory authority to insure assisted living facilities
for the care of frail elderly persons, as authorized by section 511 of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1992. This proposed rule would also expand current regulations to include the refinancing of conventional (non-FHA
insured) nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, assisted living facilities or board and care homes under
section 223(f) of the National Housing Act, and to insure additions to existing such projects. Finally, this proposed
rule would make conforming changes required by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, and would make minor
technical changes to the regulations to remove ambiguity and reflect long-standing Departmental policy.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Currently, under section 232 of the National Housing Act (NHA), and the accompanying regulations at 24 CFR part 232,
the Department insures mortgages for nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and board and care homes. Section
511 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550, approved October 28, 1992 (1992
HCD Act), amends section 232 of the NHA by authorizing FHA mortgage insurance for assisted living facilities. In compliance
with section 511 of the 1992 HCD Act, this proposed rule would revise 24 CFR part 232 to make assisted living facilities
for the care of the frail elderly eligible for mortgage insurance.

Under the NHA and this proposed rule, the term ``assisted living facility'' means a public facility, proprietary
facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation that: 

(1) Is licensed and regulated by the State or if there is no State law providing for such licensing and regulation by
the State, by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located; 

(2) Makes available to residents supportive services to assist the residents in carrying out activities of daily
living such as bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet,
laundry, home management, preparing meals, shopping for personal items, obtaining and taking medications, managing
money, using the telephone, or performing light or heavy housework, and which may make available to residents home
health care services, such as nursing, and therapy; and 

(3) Provides separate dwelling units for residents, each of which may contain a full kitchen or bathroom, and includes
common rooms and other facilities appropriate for the provision of supportive services to residents of the facility.


Under the NHA and this proposed rule, the term ``frail elderly'' has the same meaning as the term in section 802(k) of
the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA). Section 802(k)(8) defines ``frail elderly'' as
meaning an elderly person who is unable to perform at least three activities of daily living adopted by the Secretary.
(The term ``activity for daily living'' means an activity regularly necessary for personal care and includes bathing,
dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, and using the toilet.) 

An assisted living facility may be free-standing, or part of a complex that includes a nursing home, an intermediate
care facility, a board and care facility or any combination of the above. However, in compliance with section 511 of
the 1992 HCD Act, this proposed rule would not authorize mortgage insurance for an assisted living facility unless
the Secretary determines that the level of financing acquired by the mortgagor and any other resources available
for the facility are sufficient to ensure that the facility contains dwelling units and facilities for the provision
of supportive services; the mortgagor provides satisfactory assurances that no dwelling unit in the facility will
be occupied by more than one person without the consent of all such occupants; and the appropriate state licensing
agency for the state, municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is or is to be located provides
adequate assurances that the facility will comply with any applicable standards and requirements for such facilities.


Section 511 of the 1992 HCD Act also amends section 223(f) of the NHA. In accordance with section 511, this proposed
rule would authorize the refinancing of an existing assisted living facility. This proposed rule would also expand
the section 232 program to include the refinancing of conventional projects under section 223(f) of the National
Housing Act. Section 409 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 223(f) of the NHA to cover
the refinancing of existing debt of an existing nursing home, existing intermediate care facility, existing board
and care facility (collectively referred to as ``residential care facility), or any combination of the above. 

However, after section 409 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 was enacted, the Department only implemented
section 409 for existing FHA-insured residential care facilities. (On August 31, 1988 (53 FR 33735), the Department
added insurance for existing residential care facilities that are currently FHA-insured.) HUD's decision not to
implement section 409 in its entirety was based on the fact that HUD had no experience in underwriting existing residential
care facilities. By limiting the insurance for refinanced transactions to currently FHA-insured projects with
a known track record (annual inspections, availability of audited financial statements, etc.), the Department
could more adequately protect the General Insurance Fund. 

However, the House Conference Report for the NAHA (H.R. 101-943, 101st Cong. 2d Sess, at 524) emphasizes Congress's
intent that the Department fully implement section 409 to include conventional (non-FHA insured) projects. Accordingly,
the Department is now expanding the program to include mortgages for the purchase and refinancing of existing residential
care facilities with non-FHA insured mortgages under section 232 pursuant to section 223(f). 

To implement further statutory changes, this proposed rule would make projects consisting of an addition to an existing
(non-FHA insured) nursing home, board and care facility, intermediate care facility, or assisted living facility
eligible for mortgage insurance under section 232 of the NHA. Moreover, this proposed rule would increase the loan-to-value
ratio for private nonprofit mortgagors from 90 percent to 95 percent, and would make conforming changes for fire safety
equipment for assisted living facilities. 

In addition to statutory changes, this proposed rule would make minor technical amendments to part 232. Specifically,
this proposed rule would move the definition of substantial rehabilitation from  232.902(b) to the definitional
section of the regulations (section 232.1), and revise the definition of substantial rehabilitation to reflect
the requirement that rehabilitation must involve two or more major building components. The current wording ``more
than one building component'' could be erroneously interpreted.

<PARENT> FR940203-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Moreover, the word ``additions'' would be removed from the definition of substantial rehabilitation. The placement
of ``additions'' in  232.902(b) of the existing regulations has caused confusion because it incorrectly suggests
that the cost of an addition to an existing building can be used in calculating the 15 percent of value criterion. The
term ``additions,'' as used in  232.902(b) was intended to mean an addition of a new project element in a residential
care facility, such as a whirlpool bath, safety railing, etc. The Department wants to emphasize that these revisions
to the definition of substantial rehabilitation do not reflect a policy change, but are technical changes which reflect
the Department's long standing administrative policy. 

Finally, this proposed rule would increase the loan-to-value ratio for private nonprofit mortgagors from 85 percent
to 90 percent for the purchase or refinance of a residential care facility which does not involve substantial rehabilitation.




II. Other Matters 



A. Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory
Planning and Review. Any changes made to the proposed rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket
file, which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451
Seventh Street SW., Washington DC. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Specifically, the proposed rule expands eligible projects for FHA mortgage insurance
to include assisted living facilities, and additions to existing projects, neither of which are expected to have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



C. Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The finding
is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of General Counsel, the Rules Docket
Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



D. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the proposed rule is directed to owners
of residential care facilities, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State
and local governments. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review under the order. 



E. Executive Order 12606, The Family 
 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940203-1-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940203-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 



F. Regulatory Agenda 



This proposed rule was listed as item no. 1510 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56424) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



G. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The amendments that would be made to 24 CFR part 232 by this proposed rule would not add any additional information collection
burden than that already approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

 


The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.129. 



List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 232

if there is a mortgage on the existing project, such mortgage must be refinanced under this part. The mortgage amount
for an addition in all cases shall be determined under section 232.30. If the existing project requires substantial
rehabilitation then the mortgage amount for refinancing the existing facility shall be determined under   232.30
and 232.32. If the existing project does not require substantial rehabilitation then the mortgage amount for refinancing
the existing facility shall be determined under  232.903. The resulting determination for the mortgage on
the addition and the resulting determination for the refinanced mortgage on the existing project must be blended
and both the addition and the existing project must be subject to the same mortgage. 

9. Section 232.89 would be revised to read as follows: 



 232.89 

Reduction in mortgage amount. 



If the principal obligation of the mortgage exceeds 90 percent (95 percent for a private nonprofit mortgagor) of the

annual debt service and reserve fund for replacement requirements) as determined by the Commissioner, before endorsement
of the project for insurance; alternatively, the mortgagor must provide an operating deficit fund at the time of endorsement
for insurance, in an amount, and under an agreement, approved by the Commissioner.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS</USDEPT>








Disease Associated with Exposure to Certain Herbicide Agents (Multiple Myeloma and Respiratory Cancers) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive
service connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This proposed
amendment is necessary to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by
the Agent Orange Act of 1991 that there is a positive association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic
of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and the subsequent development of multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers. The
intended effect of this proposed amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions
based on herbicide exposure. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 2(a)(1) of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102-4, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), added 38 U.S.C. 1116 which
established presumptive service connection for veterans with service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era who subsequently develop, to a degree of 10 percent or more, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma (subject
to specified statutory exceptions), and chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne (within
one year of the last date of active service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era), even though there is no
record of that disease during military service. Final regulations implementing this statutory provision were published
in the 

Federal Register

 of May 19, 1993 (See 58 FR 29107-09). 


Section 3 of Public Law 102-4 directed the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association between exposure to herbicides used in support
of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and each disease suspected to be associated
with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent possible: (1) Whether there is a statistical
association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking into account the strength of the scientific
evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association; (2) the increased risk of disease
among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3)
whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide exposure
and the suspect disease. 
Section 1116(b) of 38 U.S.C. provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific
evidence, that a positive association exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical in
an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during
the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection
for that disease. An association is considered ``positive'' if the credible evidence for the association is equal
to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association. In making that determination, the Secretary is to
consider reports received from NAS as well as other available sound medical and scientific evidence and analyses.

After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and approximately 230 epidemiologic
studies, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans
and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July 27, 1993. NAS concluded that there is sufficient
evidence of an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development
of chloracne, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. VA
was already paying compensation for the first three conditions based upon the statutory presumptions established
by Public Law 102-4, and the Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association
exists between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's
disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 50528-30). 

The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings in the NAS report to determine whether a positive
association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions. That review has been completed and the Secretary
has concluded that a positive association exists for multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers. 
The NAS report found ``limited/suggestive evidence''_a category it defined as meaning that evidence suggests an

association between herbicide exposure and a specific disease, but that chance, bias, and confounding cannot be
ruled out with confidence_of an association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development of multiple
myeloma. VA, however, found the evidence concerning multiple myeloma, a malignant proliferation of plasma cells
which are derived from B lymphocytes, to be convincing. Most of the studies reviewed by NAS showed an increased risk,
although in most cases it was not a statistically significant increase. One occupational study (Fingerhut M.A.,
Halperin W.E., Marlow D.A., Piacitelli L.A., Honchar P.A., Sweeney M.H., Greife A.L., Dill P.A., Steenland K., Suruda
A.J. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. New England Journal of
Medicine 324:212-218) found a relationship between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma. Although this
finding was not supported by the findings of Saracci and colleagues (Saracci R., Kogevinas M., Bertazzi P.A., Bueno
De Mesquita B.H., Coggon D., Green L.M., Kauppinen T., L'Abbe K.A., Littorin M., Lynge E., Mathews J.D., Neuberger
M., Osman J., Pearce N., Winkelman R. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols.
Lancet 338:1027-1032), the Saracci study is flawed as a result of questions regarding exposure. Another study
(Pesatori A.C., Consonni D., Tironi A., Landi M.T., Zocchetti C., Bertazzi P.A. 1992. Cancer morbidity in the Seveso
area, 1976-1986. Chemosphere 25:209-212) showed a clear association between herbicide exposure and
multiple myeloma in both males and females. Moreover, multiple myeloma is closely related biologically to 
B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; consequently, the epidemiological evidence concerning non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
gives added weight to the association between herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma. Based on this clinical consideration
and the weight of the epidemiogical evidence, the Secretary has determined that there is a positive association between
herbicide exposure and multiple myeloma that manifests itself to a degree of 10 percent at any time after exposure.
We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.309(e) to implement the Secretary's decision. This amendment is proposed to be effective
the date of publication of the final rule, as provided by Public Law 102-4.
 
The NAS report also found limited/suggestive evidence of an association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent
development of respiratory cancers, specifically cancers of the lung, larynx, or trachea. For study purposes, NAS
included cancer of the bronchus when it considered cancer of the lung; therefore, we are including cancer of the bronchus
within the scope of the proposed presumption. 

In reviewing the NAS report, which noted that not all studies had fully controlled for or evaluated smoking as a confounding
factor, VA gave weight to the fact that the studies found high relative risks for respiratory cancers in production
workers (Manz A., Berger J., Dwyer J.H., Flesch-Janys D., Nagel S., Waltsgott H. 1991. Cancer mortality among workers
in chemical plant contaminated with dioxin. Lancet 338:959-964; Fingerhut et al., 1991). The Fingerhut study
showed an increased risk with the duration of exposure. VA also noted that despite the failure of some studies to control
for smoking, it is unlikely that there were major differences in smoking patterns between the study and control groups.
Considering all of the evidence, the Secretary has determined that the credible evidence for an association outweighs
the credible evidence against an association and that there is, therefore, a positive association between exposure
to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of respiratory cancers.

VA also found that the weight of the available evidence indicates that chemically-induced respiratory cancers manifest
within a definite period following exposure, after which there is little effect from the exposure (Finkelstein M.M.,
1991. Use of ``time windows'' to investigate lung cancer latency intervals at an Ontario steel plant. American Journal
of Industrial Medicine 19:299-235). In our judgment, it is reasonable to assume that respiratory cancers due
to herbicide exposure will show a risk pattern similar to other chemically-induced respiratory cancers, and we are
proposing as part of our rule that respiratory cancer will be presumed service connected only if it is manifest within
30 years after exposure. The longest manifestation period noted for a respiratory cancer following herbicide exposure
is about 30 years (Zach J.A., Suskind R.R. 1980. The mortality experience of workers exposed to tetrachlorodibenzodioxin
in a 
trichlorophenol process accident. Journal of Occupational Medicine 22:11-14; Zober A., Messerer P., Huber
P. 1990. Thirty-four year mortality follow-up of BASF employees to 2,3,7,8-TCDD after the 1953 accident. Occupational
Environmental Health 62:139-157). If future studies indicate that this manifestation period is inappropriate,
VA will amend it accordingly. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a) and 3.309(e) to implement the Secretary's decision.
This amendment is proposed to be effective the date of publication of the final rule, as provided by Public Law 102-4.


38 U.S.C. 1113 provides that where there is affirmative evidence to the contrary, or evidence to establish that an
intercurrent injury or disease which is a recognized cause of any of the diseases for which presumptive service connection
may be allowed under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1112 (i.e., chronic diseases, tropical diseases, prisoner-of-war
related diseases, or diseases specific to radiation-exposed veterans), has been suffered between the date of separation
from service and the onset of any such diseases, or the disability is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct, presumptive
service connection will not be in order. Section 2(b) of public law 102-4 amends 38 U.S.C. 1113 so that its provisions
also apply to the presumptive conditions associated with herbicide exposure under 38 U.S.C. 1116. Consequently,
service connection for multiple myeloma or respiratory cancers based on herbicide exposure is precluded if there
is affirmative evidence that establishes a non-service related supervening condition or event as the cause of the
multiple myeloma or respiratory cancers, or the disability is due to the veteran's own willful misconduct (See 38
U.S.C. 1113). 



The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 

The Secretary has determined that it is not feasible to allow the 60 day comment period referred to in section 6(a)(1)
of Executive Order 12866 because a comment period of that length would prevent VA from complying with the statutory
requirement to publish a final rule within 90 days of publication of the proposed rule imposed by 38 U.S.C. 1116(c)(2).

Review of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of review.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the EPA's plans to review and revise the Air Quality Criteria for Ozone and Other Photochemical
Oxidants (Criteria Document) as rapidly as possible and to complete review of the national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) for ozone (O

3

) as soon as possible thereafter. 


The Clean Air Act (Act) requires periodic review and, if appropriate, revision of the NAAQS and of the air quality criteria
on which they are based. The EPA completed its last formal review of the air quality criteria for O

3

 in 1989. Based on that review, the EPA announced a final decision on March 9, 1993 not to revise the existing O

3

 NAAQS. 
Since early 1989, however, a substantial number of new studies on the health and environmental effects of O

3

 have appeared in the peer-reviewed literature. The EPA is moving as rapidly as possible to review them, consistent
with assuring a sound, scientifically-supportable decision. 
The review process includes: (1) Reviewing and revising the Criteria Document; (2) reviewing the NAAQS through development
of a Staff Paper based on the revised Criteria Document; (3) external review of Criteria Document and Staff Paper drafts
by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board, an independent panel
of scientific experts, and by the public; and (4) examining implementation ramifications of changes to the O

3

 NAAQS. The EPA intends to adhere to strict schedules for external review of Criteria Document and Staff Paper drafts
consistent with a full opportunity for thorough scientific and public review, and to deny any requests for extensions
of the public comment periods specified in this notice. 
During this NAAQS review, the EPA intends to continue implementing programs designed to meet the current standards
and the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to ensure continued improvement in air quality. The EPA
is also examining options for implementing alternative O

3

 NAAQS to ensure a smooth transition if a decision is made to revise the existing NAAQS. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background


Based on a Criteria Document issued by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1970, the EPA promulgated
the first NAAQS for photochemical oxidants under section 109 of the Act (36 FR 8186) in 1971. The primary and secondary
NAAQS were both set at an hourly average of 0.08 parts per million (ppm) total photochemical oxidants not to be exceeded
more than 1 hour per year. 
In 1977, the EPA announced (42 FR 20493) the first review and updating of the 1970 Criteria Document in accordance with
section 109(d)(1) of the Act. The EPA published a Criteria Document in 1978. Based on the revised Criteria Document
and taking into account public comments on revisions proposed to the primary and secondary NAAQS in 1978 (43 FR 16962),
the EPA announced revisions to the 1971 standards in 1979 (44 FR 8202). The primary standard was revised from 0.08 parts
per million (ppm) to 0.12 ppm; the secondary standard was set identical to the primary standard; the chemical designation
of the standards was changed from photochemical oxidants to O

3

; and the form of the standards was revised from a deterministic form to a statistical form, which defines attainment
of the standards as occurring when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations
greater than 0.12 ppm is equal to or less than one. 
In 1982 (47 FR 11561), the EPA announced plans to revise the 1978 Criteria Document. In 1983, the EPA announced (48 FR
38009) that review of primary and secondary standards for O

3

 had been initiated. The EPA subsequently provided a number of opportunities for public review and comment on drafts
of the Criteria Document and associated Staff Paper (Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone:
Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information_Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Staff Paper).
After reviewing the draft Criteria Document in 1985 and 1986, the CASAC sent the Administrator a ``closure letter''
outlining key issues and recommendations and indicating that it was satisfied with the final draft of the 1986 Criteria
Document. 
Following closure, a number of scientific articles and abstracts were published or accepted for publication that
appeared to be of sufficient importance concerning potential health and welfare effects of O

3

 to warrant preparation of a supplement to the Criteria Document (Supplement). The CASAC, having already reviewed
two drafts of the Staff Paper in 1986 and 1987, concluded that sufficient new information existed to recommend incorporation
of relevant new information into a third draft of the Staff Paper.

The CASAC held a public meeting in 1988 to review a draft Supplement and the third draft Staff Paper. Major issues included:
The definition of adverse health effects of O

3

; the significance of health studies suggesting that exercising individuals exposed for 6 to 8 hours to O

3

 levels at or below 0.12 ppm may experience lung inflammation and transient decreases in pulmonary function; the possibility
that chronic irreversible effects may result from long-term exposures to elevated levels of O

3

; and, the importance of analyses indicating that agricultural crop damage may be better defined by a cumulative seasonal
average than by a 1-hour peak level of O

3

. In its ``closure letter'' of 1989, the CASAC indicated that the draft Supplement and draft Staff Paper ``provide
an adequate scientific basis for the EPA to retain or revise primary and secondary standards for ozone.'' 
On October 22, 1991, the American Lung Association and other plaintiffs filed suit under section 304 of the Act to compel
the EPA to complete its review of the criteria and standards for O

3

 under section 109(d)(1) of the Act [

American Lung Association 

v. 

Reilly, 

No. 91-cv-4114 (JRB) (E.D.N.Y.)]. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York subsequently
issued an order requiring the EPA to sign a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing its proposed decision on whether to revise the standards for O

3

 by August 1, 1992 and to sign a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing its final decision by March 1, 1993. 
On August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35542), the EPA published a proposed decision under section 109(d)(1) that revisions to the
existing primary and secondary standards were not appropriate at that time. The notice explained in some detail (see
57 FR 35546) that the proposed decision would complete the EPA's review of information on health and welfare effects
of O

3

 assembled over a 7-year period and contained in the 1986 Criteria Document and the 1989 Supplement. The notice made
clear that the Administrator did not take into account more recent studies on the health and welfare effects of O

3

 because these studies had not been assessed in the 1986-1989 Criteria Document/Supplement, nor had they collectively
undergone the rigorous, integrative review process (including CASAC review) required to incorporate them into
a new criteria document. The proposed decision, therefore, was based on an evaluation of key studies published through
early 1989 as contained in the 1986-89 Criteria Document/Supplement, the 1989 Staff Paper assessment of the
most relevant information in these documents, and the advice and recommendations of the CASAC as presented both in
the discussion of these documents at public meetings and in the CASAC's 1986 and 1989 ``closure letters.'' 
In view of the large number of recent scientific papers and ongoing research on the health and welfare effects of O

3

, the August 10, 1992 notice also announced the EPA's intention to proceed as rapidly as possible with the next review
of the air quality criteria and standards for O

3

. On March 9, 1993 (58 FR 13008) the EPA published its final decision not to revise the current primary and secondary
NAAQS for O

3

. Because of the scientific and technical complexity of such assessments, the EPA had estimated that 2 to 3 years would
be necessary to rigorously assess more than 1,000 new studies and incorporate key information into a revised criteria
document, to evaluate the significance of the key information for decision-making purposes, to develop staff recommendations
for the Administrator, and to provide appropriate opportunities for CASAC review and public comment. Given the potential
importance of the new studies and the EPA's continuing concern about the health and welfare effects of O

3

, the March 9, 1993 notice also indicated the Administrator's intention to move the review process ahead as quickly
as possible and, if appropriate, to propose revisions of the standards at the earliest possible date. 


 Current Review Process/Schedule 


Following publication of the March 9, 1993 decision, the Agency, in consultation with the CASAC and the Science Advisory
Board, undertook a rigorous examination of the NAAQS review process designed to identify all measures that could
be taken to accelerate its review of the criteria and standards for O

3

 consistent with assuring a sound and scientifically-credible decision. As a result, the EPA has adopted a number
of measures intended to accelerate the O

3

 NAAQS review. These measures include: (1) Conducting review and revision of the Criteria Document and development
of the Staff Paper and associated analyses (e.g., exposure analysis and health risk assessments) in a more concurrent
fashion than in the previous NAAQS reviews; (2) adhering to strict schedules for external review of Criteria Document
and Staff Paper drafts consistent with a full opportunity for thorough scientific and public review; (3) establishing
a highly-expedited Agency review process with senior level management oversight and involvement throughout the
process, as well as early discussion of possible options with other Federal agencies, including the Office of Management
and Budget; and (4) reducing the volume of information included in the revised Criteria Document by focusing on the
most important new studies and setting a date beyond which new studies will not be included. 
The EPA's current O

3

 NAAQS review schedule incorporates the measures cited above. The Agency's target date for completion of the Criteria
Document and Staff Paper is mid-1995, with proposal of changes to the O

3

 NAAQS, if appropriate, in mid-1996 and promulgation in mid-1997. Table 1 outlines key milestone dates for this accelerated
schedule. 
As indicated in Table 1, there are a number of opportunities for public comment throughout the process. The EPA encourages
involvement of interested parties and is providing this advance notice to alert potential participants in the review
that adhering to the schedule will require some departures from past practices.

<TEXT>
 




In particular, the EPA has often granted requests for 
extensions of public comment periods in previous reviews; in 
order to meet the accelerated schedule for the O

3

 NAAQS review, however, the EPA intends not to grant such extensions during this review. Accordingly, potential participants
in the review should take note of the process outlined in this notice and be prepared to respond promptly when opportunities
to comment are offered. 
Given the scientific and technical complexity of the issues likely to be involved in the O

3

 review, the diversity of scientific opinion that has characterized previous reviews of the criteria and standards
for O

3

, and the need to ensure that its ultimate decision is soundly based, the EPA cannot, of course, provide any absolute
assurance that 
it will meet all of the interim milestone dates indicated in Table 1. Completion of the necessary steps in a timely manner
is also predicated upon the availability of adequate resources during the review process. However, the Administrator
has emphasized a high priority on meeting the accelerated schedule outlined in this notice. 
To that end, the review process is well under way. The EPA initiated action to update the air quality criteria for O

3

 in August 1992 (57 FR 38832). It held two peer-review workshops on draft health effects chapters of a revised Criteria
Document (58 FR 35454) in July 1993. Additional workshops on draft air quality and ecological effects chapters (58
FR 48063) were held in September 1993. Since 
then, the EPA has discussed the schedule and process outlined in this notice with the CASAC (58 FR 59034). The EPA is
also conducting exposure and risk analyses. A 
subcommittee of the CASAC met on December 16, 1993 to review methodologies (58 FR 63345). A further subcommittee meeting
on risk analysis is planned for spring 1994.

Implementation 



It is important to stress that while conducting this review, the EPA remains committed to implementing the existing
O

3

 NAAQS in accordance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA). During the review, the EPA will continue to work
with States to implement emission control strategies required by the CAAA to meet the existing O

3

 NAAQS. These efforts include State and Federal actions to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen
oxides, which act as precursors to O

3

 formation in the troposphere. The EPA will make every effort to maintain implementation schedules consistent with
requirements of the CAAA to ensure continued improvement in air quality. 
As part of the review, the EPA is examining the ramifications of any changes to the NAAQS on current implementation
efforts. If appropriate, new implementation rules and guidelines will be considered for alternative NAAQS. The
EPA also is reviewing options to ensure a smooth transition for implementation of any new O

3

 NAAQS in the event a decision is made to revise the current O

3

 NAAQS.

Connection of Customer-Provided Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network



<AGENCY>

Federal Communications Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rules.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend rules which regulate the terms and conditions under which
customer-provided terminal equipment may be connected to the telephone network. The proceeding was initiated by
petitions for rulemaking filed by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (SWB) and Ameritech Operating Companies
(Ameritech) who ask that regulations governing switched digital services be added. The effect of the proposed rules
would be to promote rapid exploitation of switched digital technology. We propose also to provide for a registration
revocation procedure which should greatly enhance our ability to enforce applicable rules as well as the Telecommunications
Trade Act of 1988; and we take this opportunity to propose clarifications to other rules.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This summarizes the NPRM in CC Docket 93-268, RM-7815, and RM-6147 (FCC 93-484) adopted October
22, 1993 and released November 22, 1993, supplemented by an Errata, and Order Extending Comment Period released January
12, 1994 (DA 94-46). Persons affected by part 68 practice and procedure are urged to review the full texts of both
the NPRM and Errata, and the supporting file, which are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours
of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC. Copies may be purchased
from the Commission's duplicating contractor, ITS, Inc., 2100 M St., NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202)
857-3800. 



Paperwork Reduction Act



Reporting and recordkeeping activities needed to comply with the proposed rules are usual and customary. 



Analysis of Proceeding 



1. By this NPRM we contemplate amending parts 2 and 68 of the rules, 47 CFR parts 2 and 68. A purpose of part 68 is to maintain
uniform standards for the protection of the telephone network from harms caused by the connection of terminal equipment
and associated wiring. This proceeding was initiated by two petitions for rulemaking, one filed by SWB (RM-7815)
and the other by Ameritech (RM-6147). 

2. SWB requests that part 68 be amended to include the regulation of terminal equipment connected to the two-wire Basic
Rate Access (BRA) interface and to the Primary Rate Access (PRA) interface provided by Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) access technology. BRA consists of one or two 64 Kbps information channels with a 16 Kbps channel for
dialing and network access information. The 1.544 Mbps PRA consists of 23 64 Kbps information channels and the 64 Kbps
dialing and network access channel. ISDN is in a developmental phase, being deployed these last few years in an experimental
mode. The Public Notice of SWB's petition elicited comments from eight parties and reply comments from three. There
was overwhelming support for including this service in part 68 in order to promote, on a nationwide and worldwide basis,
rapid exploitation of this technology with minimum mandatory criteria for connection of CPE (customer premises
equipment). Thus, we propose for comment technical standards for including this service in part 68 in supplement
to the existing standards for non-switched leased-line digital services which were added in 1985. 

3. Commenting on SWB's petition, AT&T recommends (a) that part 68 rules covering PRA not be limited to the two-wire
ISDN BRA service but also authorize terminal equipment connected to the 4-wire ISDN PRA (1.544 Mbps) interface pursuant
to performance and compatibility standards adopted by ANSI (American National Standards Institute); (b) that amendments
to part 68 provide equipment specifications for both PRA and BRA interfaces; (c) that  68.308(h)(2) be amended
to apply its limitations on encoded analog content to PRA terminal equipment comparable to the limitations suggested
by SWB for BRA terminal equipment; and (d) that the signaling interference requirements in  68.314(d)(2) apply
also to ISDN terminal equipment. The rules we present for comment reflect those recommendations. 

4. AT&T observes also that SWB's petition would add a new  68.310(m) to introduce a ``longitudinal-to-metallic''
(L-M) balance requirement for equipment connected to the ISDN interface. AT&T notes that the L-M
balance concept was rejected by the Commission in previous rulemakings in favor of the ``metallic-to-longitudinal''
(M-L) balance methodology currently in the rules. The L-M methodology is considered to be a performance
measure which is not a primary concern of part 68, whereas the M-L balance requirement squarely addresses crosstalk
interference that terminal equipment may induce in cables running to the central office, which is a harm to the network
and thus within part 68's purview. Thus, we propose adding to part 68 limitations on encoded analog content for equipment
connected to the ISDN interface.

5. AT&T states also that though-gain limitations in  68.308(b)(5) should be established for ISDN services.
We understand that this is a current project for the Telecommunication Industry Association's (TIA's) TR-41
Committee, whom we anticipate will provide appropriate recommendations.

6. The types of plug-jack connectors to be used for ISDN services engendered comment. Ameritech says that the ANSI
standard for BRA proposes an eight-position non-keyed jack in which two positions are for the tip and ring connections
to the service itself, and the remaining six positions are reserved. Ameritech offers ISDN BRA via the standard RJ11C
jack which provides connections for two wires, although the jack itself can accommodate up to six wires. Most ISDN
compatible equipment can accommodate such a connection, so there is no need to require the eight-position jack, states
Ameritech, who believes that manufacturers who ``build-to'' the eight-position interface could provide connection
to the type RJ11C through a simple six-position to eight-position double-male adapter. US West recommends that the
jack type SJA-11 (8-position) proposed by ECSA (the Exchange Carriers Standards Association's T1E1 Technical
Subcommittee) be approved by the Commission's tariff implementation procedure. We solicit comments on these proposals
for ISDN BRA and PRA interface connectors and for suitable connectors for the Public Switched Digital Services (PSDS).
It would be helpful also if interested parties would, as requested in n.7 of the NPRM, offer comments on the recommendations
of ECSA for network connectors for ISDN BRA and PSDS.

7. The Public Notice of Ameritech's petition produced two comments and two reply comments. Ameritech petitions for
amendment of part 68 to include terminal equipment that connects to PSDS. We request comment. As the result of joint
comments by Mountain States Telephone Company, Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and Pacific Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company, equipment standards for a four-wire 56 Kbps service are also included for comment. It is important
to recognize that all three technologies (56 and 64 Kbps time compression and four-wire 56 Kbps switched services)
are call-compatible, and a performance and compatibility standard for the three has recently been published by TIA.
Not discussed in the pleadings is the fact that a new technology known as ``inverse multiplexing'' or ``bandwidth
on demand'' is being used which permits customers to utilize PSDS and ISDN BRA technologies to order wider bandwidths
in multiples of 56 or 64 Kbps. Commenters should address whether inverse multiplexing utilizing such channels and
other bandwidths require consideration under part 68.

8. In outlining the intent of newly-proposed part 68, the Commission stated in its First Supplemental Notice, released
April 3, 1973, 40 F.C.C.2d 315, 316 (1973) that ``[r]egistration would constitute authorization for the equipment
to be directly connected to the switched telephone network. However, in appropriate cases, registration could be
revoked.'' But the rules do not include part 68 equipment authorization revocation procedures which can be relied
upon; therefore, we propose adoption of rules which detail the circumstances under which equipment registrations
may be revoked and which define equipment revocation procedures, including automatic denial of equipment authorization
of the same product for a period of six months from the date of revocation. The proposed revocation procedure tracks
closely established Commission procedure for Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL) for assessment of a monetary penalty
(47 CFR 1.80 and 1.89). Revocation of an equipment registration may be imposed in addition to or in lieu of an amount
in forfeiture pursuant to section 1.80 of the rules. Therefore, we propose that a Notice of Intent to Revoke may be served
concurrently with and as part of a NAL. In the case of joint NAL and Intent to Revoke,  1.80 of the rules would govern
all procedural issues. In those cases where a material dispute of fact is involved, the Commission would, if appropriate,
designate the proceeding for hearing before an administrative law judge. The registration revocation procedure
is expected to greatly enhance our ability to enforce part 68, as well as the Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988 which
requires that all telecommunications equipment imported into the United States meet the requirements of the Commission's
rules and regulations. We seek comment on these procedures which are set forth in detail in the NPRM and proposed rules.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes to require operators of gas distribution pipelines who do not maintain customer-owned service
lines to advise their customers of the proper maintenance of these gas lines and of the potential hazards of not properly
maintaining these gas lines. This proposed rulemaking, in response to a statutory mandate, is intended to ensure
that homeowners and other owners of customer-owned service lines are made aware of the requirements for maintenance
of those lines; the resources known to the operator that could properly aid the customer in doing such maintenance;
any information that the operator has concerning the operation and maintenance of its service lines that could aid
customers; and the potential hazards of not maintaining customer-owned service lines.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR 192.3 define a gas service line as a distribution line that transports gas
from a common source of supply to (1) a customer meter or the connection to a customer's piping, whichever is farther
downstream, or (2) the connection to a customer's piping if there is no customer meter. The source of supply for most
gas services is a main commonly located in the street. For service lines to homes and buildings, the customer meter,
which measures the transfer of gas from the operator to the consumer, is commonly located adjacent to (outside or inside)
an exterior wall. A service line may also end at a customer meter adjacent to end-use gas equipment. For all of the above
installations, the operator is responsible for compliance with part 192 standards from the common source of supply
(e.g., the main) to the end of the service line. 


Customer-Owned Service Lines 


Not all customer meters are located adjacent to a home or building wall or end-use equipment. Some customer meters
are located at property lines or at other locations more convenient for the gas distribution operator or for the customer.
In such cases, the service line ends at the meter and the pipe running from the outlet of the meter to the exterior wall
or end-use equipment is called a customer-owned service line. 
Instances also exist where there is no customer meter or the operator-owned service line extends beyond the meter
to the connection to a customer's piping. In such cases, the pipe running from this connection to the exterior wall
or end-use equipment is called a customer-owned service line. 

Customer-owned service lines are also known as ``yard lines'' and ``fuel lines''. A ``farm tap'' is a customer-owned
service line that begins at a customer meter, usually adjacent to a gas transmission line, and runs (often a considerable
distance) to a single consumer. For the purposes of this notice, each of the above situations is referred to as a customer-owned
service line. 
Customer-owned service lines are thought to comprise 12 to 17 percent of the piping that transports natural gas from
distribution mains to homes, businesses, and other consumers. These lines are predominantly found in the states
of Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia.
Many states have few, if any, customer-owned service lines because the customer meter is adjacent to the home or building
wall or the state regulatory agency has required the distribution operator to be responsible for operation and maintenance
of the service line up to the home or building wall, regardless of where the meter is placed. These states include California,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin,
and Wyoming. 
Federal pipeline safety regulations do not cover customer-owned service lines, although a few states have issued
regulations and some gas distribution operators voluntarily maintain these lines to part 192 standards. In most
states, the material, design, construction, corrosion control, testing, and maintenance of customer-owned service
lines is left to the discretion of people who may not be familiar with part 192 requirements for service lines. This
has resulted in instances of improper installation and minimal or no maintenance of these lines. 
Over the last five years, one-third of all pipeline-related fatalities reported to the Department of Transportation
involved distribution lines running from mains to homes and other buildings. An unregulated customer-owned service
line buried downstream of a customer meter is prone to the same environmental stresses (corrosion and earth settlement)
and excavation damage hazards as a regulated service line buried upstream of a customer meter. However, because of
its proximity to homes, businesses and schools, the unregulated segment of a customer-owned service line buried
downstream of a customer meter poses a greater risk to people and property than the regulated segment of the line buried
upstream of the meter. 
The safety of customer-owned service lines first emerged as an issue after a series of five natural gas incidents occurred
during a 7-month period beginning September 16, 1988, in the Kansas City-Topeka area. These instances resulted in
four fatalities, twelve injuries, and the destruction of four homes. In three of those incidents, the failures were
attributed to corrosion on unprotected customer-owned service lines. 
As a result of these incidents, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, and New York made significant changes to their state's
pipeline safety regulations. These changes included extending the state regulatory authority over service lines
to the building wall. Under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (49 App. U.S.C. 1671 

et seq.

), states may adopt more stringent safety regulations than the Federal regulations if the state regulations are not
incompatible with federal regulations.

In addition to its response to the accidents by extending regulatory authority to include customer-owned service
lines, the Missouri Public Service Commission also required the operator to replace some 265,000 bare steel gas lines
running from the main to the building wall, of which some 175,000 were fully or partly owned by the customer. The Kansas
City Corporation Commission required the operator to perform periodic leakage surveys of all customer-owned service
lines and to repair or replace all lines round to be leaking. 


Statutory Mandate


Section 115(a) of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the Act, Pub. L. 102-508, October 24, 1992) amended the Natural
Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (49 U.S.C. App. 1685) to require the Secretary of Transportation to_




* * * Issue regulations requiring operators of natural gas distribution pipelines which do not maintain
customer-owned service lines up to building walls to advise their customers of the requirements for maintenance
of those lines, any resources known to the operator that could aid customers in doing such maintenance, any information
that the operator has concerning the operation and maintenance of its lines that could aid customers, and the potential
hazards of not maintaining service lines. 




Anecdotal data available to RSPA indicates that some of the petroleum gas systems covered under  192.11 include
customer-owned service lines where the material, design, construction, corrosion control, testing and maintenance
is left to the discretion of people who may not be familiar with part 192 requirements for service lines. RSPA invites
public comment on (1) Whether customer-owned service lines occur in petroleum gas systems subject to  192.11
and (2) If so, whether the petroleum gas systems have been properly installed and periodically maintained. Commenters
are requested to support their responses with leak and incident data that includes information on personal injuries,
deaths, property and environmental damages. 


AGA Petition


The American Gas Association (AGA) has petitioned RSPA to issue immediately a proposed rule to establish the notification
regulations mandated in section 115 of the Act (P-50, September 1, 1993). In its petition, AGA expresses concern
that, lacking federal guidance, state and local authorities may move forward and adopt notification requirements
that could make compliance with federal regulations difficult. 
AGA has requested RSPA to incorporate the following language to satisfy the notification requirements for operations
of customer-owned service lines: 




(a) Each operator meeting the applicability requirements of paragraph (c) (of this section) shall provide notification
to customers covering the maintenance of customer-owned lines. At minimum, this notification shall advise those
customers:

<TEXT>
 

(1) That they own and are responsible for the maintenance of customer-owned lines; 
(2) Of the requirements for maintenance of those lines in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; 
(3) Who should be contacted to assist in the maintenance of customer-owned lines; 
(4) Of information that the operator has concerning the maintenance of its lines that could aid the customer in performing
such maintenance; and 
(5) That periodic maintenance of customer-owned lines is necessary in order to avoid potential safety problems,
such as gas leakage. 
(b) If the applicable codes and standards do not address maintenance of those lines, the information that operators
provide under paragraph (a)(4) of this section must describe the maintenance requirements for customer-owned lines.

(c) The notification requirements in paragraph (a) (of this section) apply to operators for which one or more customers
have responsibility for maintenance of a substantial portion of the primary underground natural gas supply pipe
between the operator's main and the foundation wall of the customer's premise, or its equivalent in those installations
where the supply piping does not enter a building but rather goes directly to end-use equipment located outdoors.




AGA's petition is on file in the docket and was taken into consideration during development of this notice of proposed
rulemaking. 


Proposals


Federal gas pipeline safety standards do not require gas pipeline operators to maintain customer-owned service
lines. In many cases, the owner of the customer-owned service line is not aware he or she is responsible for the maintenance
of the customer-owned service line or what those maintenance responsibilities are. To address these concerns, AGA's
petition, and the statutory mandate, RSPA proposes to revise  192.3 to add a definition of customer-owned service
lines, and to add  192.16 concerning notification requirements for customer-owned service lines to subpart
A of 49 CFR part 192. 
At this time, RSPA is proposing to apply the notification requirements to operators of petroleum gas systems covered
under  192.11. Thus, for the purpose of this discussion, the word ``operator'' will apply to those operators
of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems that do not maintain customer-owned service lines up to the
home or building wall or to the end-use equipment. 
RSPA is aware there are situations where the meter is adjacent to, but not at, the home or building wall or the end-use
equipment. In these instances, the operator is responsible for the pipeline up to the meter, and the customer is responsible
for the small portion of buried pipeline from the outlet of the meter to the home or building wall or to the end-use equipment.
At this time, RSPA is proposing to apply the notification requirements to these sections of pipeline when the operator
does not voluntarily maintain these sections of pipeline. RSPA invites public comment on whether these short sections
of customer-owned service line have been properly installed and whether they are periodically maintained. RSPA
believes that some of these sections were installed and are voluntarily maintained by the operator, even though they
are the responsibility of the customer. Commenters are requested to support their responses with leak and incident
data that includes information on personal injuries, deaths, and property damages. 
The following discussion covers the requirements listed within section 115(a) of the Act and how RSPA proposes to
address them. 


Maintenance Requirements for Customer-Owned Service Lines 


RSPA requires operator-owned service lines to be operated and maintained to 49 CFR part 192 standards. These pipeline
safety standards include leak detection surveys and corrosion control. Subpart I details the requirements for corrosion
control, and subpart M details leak detection surveys and other maintenance requirements. Local codes and standards
may also address operation and maintenance requirements. This notice proposes that operators provide to the owners
of customer-owned service lines general information on these safety requirements. The proposal does not require
operators to take over the maintenance of these lines. 
Under the proposal, operators would be allowed to use any written means to provide actual notification of the required
information to customers. RSPA anticipates most operators will provide notice through inserts mailed to the customer
and flyers hand delivered by the meter readers. 


Maintenance Resources 


Many resources are available to assist owners of customer-owned service lines in obtaining information to assure
effective service line maintenance, including information supplied by the operator. The sources referenced below
can provide general information on corrosion control and leakage surveys, and may be able to provide an actual listing
of gas distribution contractors (including plumbers) or other individuals who could perform these maintenance
requirements. The addresses and telephone numbers listed are current to the best of RSPA's knowledge. 


The State Licensing Board for Plumbers and State Plumbers' Associations


The state licensing board for plumbers and state plumbers' associations can provide owners of customer-owned service
lines with a listing of qualified, independent contractors who perform leakage surveys, gas piping repair and replacement,
and valve repair and replacement.

Operation and Maintenance Information 


This notice proposes to require gas distribution operators to advise customers of any information that the operator
has concerning the operation and maintenance of its lines that could aid customers. This information could include
the following: 


Excavation damage prevention:

 Excavation damage is the largest single cause of gas pipeline incidents. Section 192.614 currently requires gas
pipeline operators to notify the public in the vicinity of their pipeline on how to prevent damage to the pipeline from
excavation activities. Section 192.614 currently exempts pipelines in class 1 and 2 locations and pipelines in class
3 locations which are marked in accordance with  192.707. However, in a pending rulemaking (``Excavation Damage
Prevention Programs for Gas, Hazardous Liquids and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines'', Docket 101, 53 FR 24747, June 30,
1988), RSPA has proposed removing these exemptions. 


Type of pipe:

 Different pipeline materials require different maintenance procedures. An operator's knowledge of the environmental
conditions affecting the service pipe connected to the customer-owned service line may assist the owner in the maintenance
of the customer-owned service line.



Age of the pipe:

 The installation date of customer-owned service lines, installed by individuals other than the operator, may not
be known. However, many operators will have a record of the date gas service was initially established to the customer.
In such cases, operators may reasonably assume that the installation date of the customer-owned service line is approximately
the date of initial gas service. This information may then be relayed to the customer to assist in estimating the condition
of the pipeline. 


Potential Hazards:

 This notice proposes to require an operator to inform customers of the potential hazards of not maintaining a customer-owned
service line. Improper maintenance or lack of periodic maintenance of customer-owned service lines may result in
corrosion of metallic pipeline materials, separation of piping components, gas leaks, property damage, environmental
damage, personal injury, and even death. 


Regulatory Analyses 


Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This proposed rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
and, therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant
under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).
A regulatory evaluation is available for review in the docket. 


Executive Order 12612 


The proposed rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''),
and does not have sufficient federalism impacts to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule would apply to operators of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems. Small gas distribution
systems are characterized in this proposal as distribution systems serving fewer than 10,000 customers. They include
master meter systems, which usually serve mobile home parks, housing projects and apartment complexes, and public,
private, and municipal natural gas distribution systems. 
Master meter systems, as defined in  191.3, are pipeline systems for distributing gas within, but not limited
to, a definable area, such as a mobile home park, housing project, or apartment complex, where the operator purchases
metered gas from an outside source for resale through a gas distribution system. The gas distribution pipeline system
supplies the ultimate consumer who either purchases the gas directly through a meter or by other means, such as by rents.

RSPA has determined that master meter operators will not be affected by this notice of proposed rulemaking because
the master meter operator generally owns the complete gas distribution system. Thus, the master meter operator is
responsible for the pipeline from the point of purchase to the ultimate customer. 

A draft regulatory evaluation has been prepared to determine the economic impact of this proposed rule on public,
private, and municipal gas distribution systems. Based on the facts available, I certify that this proposal will
not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification
is subject to modification as a result of a review of comments received in response to this proposal. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements associated with this notice of proposed rulemaking are being submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 under the following:

 


Administration: Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration; 

Title: Customer-owned service line information dissemination; 

Need for Information: To reduce the number of incidents and resulting deaths, injuries, property, and environmental
damage caused by improper maintenance of customer-owned service lines; 

Proposed Use of Information: To advise owners of customer-owned service lines of the proper maintenance of these
gas lines and of the potential hazards of not properly maintaining these lines; 

Frequency: Occasionally; 

Burden Estimate: $500,000 initially, $50,000 annually thereafter; 

Respondents: Gas distribution operators; 

Form(s): N/A; 

Average Burden Hours per Respondent: minimal.

 


For further information contact: The Information Management Division, M-34, Office of the Secretary of Transportation,
400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-4735. Comments on the proposed information collection
requirements should be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration.
It is requested that comments sent to OMB also be sent to the RSPA rulemaking docket for this proposed action. 



List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 192 



Pipeline safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




In consideration of the foregoing, RSPA proposes to amend 49 CFR part 192 as follows: 



PART 192_[AMENDED] 



1. The authority citation for part 192 continues to read as follows:

 




Authority:

Vaginal Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Withdrawal of Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of withdrawal of advance notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice to withdraw the advance notice of proposed rulemaking of
October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694) that would have established conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) vaginal
drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of withdrawal
after considering the report and recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Contraceptives and Other Vaginal
Drug Products (the Vaginal Panel) and public comments on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that was based on
those recommendations. This action is being taken in part because the agency has determined that some of the recommended
labeling indications relate to cosmetic claims and not drug claims. In addition, recommended labeling indications
and ingredients used for minor irritation, itching, or soreness 
are not unique to the vaginal area and are already being considered in other OTC drug rulemakings (e.g., antifungal,
antimicrobial, and external analgesic). Therefore, those ingredients and indications will be considered in those
other rulemakings, as appropriate. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694), FDA published, under  330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC vaginal drug products, together with the recommendations
of the Vaginal Panel, which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients
in this drug class. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by January 11, 1984. Reply comments in response
to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by March 19, 1984.
 

 In accordance with  330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Vaginal Panel were put on public
display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn
Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information.
 In this notice, FDA states for the first time its position on the establishment of a monograph for OTC vaginal drug products
based on the Vaginal Panel's conclusions and recommendations on OTC vaginal drug products, the comments received,
and the agency's independent evaluation of the Vaginal Panel's report. In the preamble to the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug products (48 FR 46694 at 46695), the agency expressed its concerns about: (1) The ability
of a woman to recognize the nature or cause of the symptom(s) of vaginal itching, irritation, or soreness in order to
determine which kind of drug product to select to treat the condition, and (2) whether 1 to 2 weeks of self-medicating
with an OTC drug product may pose an unacceptable delay in seeking professional attention if the symptom(s) of itching,
irritation, or soreness are due to 

N. gonorrhoea

, 

Trichomonas

, 

Candida

, or other organisms that will not be eradicated by topical therapy with nonantimicrobial OTC drug products. At that
time, no final agency decisions were made regarding the Vaginal Panel's recommendations or the above stated concerns.
The agency invited specific comments on these issues.
 In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, four drug manufacturers, two trade associations, nine
consumers, four medical associations, two pharmaceutical associations, three surgeons general, one poison control
center, three consumer groups, two community health associations, and three practicing medical groups submitted
comments. Copies of the comments received are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above).

 All OTC volumes cited throughout this document refer to the submissions made by interested persons pursuant to the
call-for-data notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 16, 1973 (38 FR 12840) or to additional information that has come to the agency's attention since publication
of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch under
docket number 82N-0291.


 I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments



 A. General Comments


 1. One comment contended that OTC drug monographs are interpretive, as opposed to substantive, regulations. The
comment referred to statements on this issue submitted earlier to other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings.
 The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preamble to the procedures for classification of
OTC drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464 at 9471 to 9472), and in paragraph 3 of the preamble to the tentative final monograph for OTC
antacid drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260). FDA reaffirms the conclusions stated in those documents. Court decisions have
confirmed the agency's authority to issue substantive regulations by rulemaking. (See, e.g., 

National Nutritional Foods Association

 v. 

Weinberger

, 512 F.2d 688, 696-698 (2d Cir. 1975) and 

National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers

 v. 

FDA

, 487 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), 

aff'd

, 637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981).)
 2. One comment disagreed with the Vaginal Panel's statement that ``If an active ingredient is present in a therapeutic
concentration, the product is a drug, even if that product does not claim to produce the effect which will result from
the action of the therapeutically effective ingredient * * *,'' (48 FR 46694 at 46701). The comment argued that drug
status of a product is determined only by its intended use, not by the inclusion of certain ingredients, and the presence
of a certain ingredient in a product offered solely as a cosmetic does not make the product a drug. The comment stated
that FDA's policy concerning drug versus cosmetic status has been stated in many documents, including the procedural
regulations governing the OTC drug review (37 FR 9464 to 9475), and that the Vaginal Panel did not properly apply this
policy. The comment added that there is no justification to apply a different principle to this rulemaking for vaginal
drug products. The comment requested that the term ``drug product'' be used throughout the regulation wherever products
are specifically identified to emphasize the difference between cosmetic and drug products, e.g., vaginal douche
drug products.
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) provides the statutory definitions that differentiate a drug from
a cosmetic. A ``drug'' is defined in part as an article ``intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
or prevention of disease'' or ``intended to affect the structure or any function of the body * * *.'' (See 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)
and (C).) A ``cosmetic,'' on the other hand, is defined as an article intended to be ``* * * applied to the human body or
any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, * * *.'' (See
21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1).) Therefore, the agency agrees with the comment that the intended use of a product is the primary
determining factor as to whether a product is a drug, a cosmetic, or both. This intended use may be inferred from the
product's labeling, promotional material, advertising, and any other relevant factor. See, e.g., 

National Nutritional Foods Ass'n

 v. 

Mathews

, 557 F.2d 325, 334 (2d Cir. 1977).
 The type and amount of ingredient(s) present in a product, even if that product does not make explicit drug claims,
must be considered in determining its regulatory status. For example, the mere presence of a pharmacologically active
ingredient could make a product a drug even in the absence of explicit drug claims. In these cases, the intended use
would be implied because of the known or recognized drug effects of the ingredient (e.g., fluoride in a dentifrice).
 The agency does not believe that it is necessary to use the term ``drug product'' throughout OTC drug monographs to
distinguish between drug and cosmetic products because the labeling in final monographs applies only to products
that fall within the statutory definition of a drug, and does not apply to cosmetic products. However, if a product
is intended for both drug and cosmetic uses, e.g., cleansing and treating a disease condition, it must conform to the
requirements of the applicable final monograph(s) for OTC drug products, as well as bear appropriate labeling for
cosmetic use in conformity with section 602 of the act (21 U.S.C. 362) and the provisions of parts 701 and 740 (21 CFR
parts 701 and 740).
 3. In response to the agency's specific request for comment on the appropriateness of OTC drug products for treating
the symptoms of itching, irritation, and soreness in or around the vagina (48 FR 46694 at 46695), several comments
stated that treating these symptoms with OTC drug products is appropriate and rational therapy because women can
readily recognize these symptoms and the benefits to be derived from the use of these drugs far outweigh any risks associated
with their OTC availability. A number of comments stated that there is no valid medical basis to conclude, as was suggested
by FDA in the preamble of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antifungal drug products (47 FR
12480, March 23, 1982), that a serious health hazard could result from self-treating the symptom of external feminine
itching. The comments contended that the likelihood of masking more serious gynecological disorders such as gonorrhea
or trichomoniasis, or masking a more serious condition such as diabetes, was highly unlikely provided the labeling
of the products advises consumers to consult a physician if symptoms worsen or persist for longer than 1 week. To further
support its contention that serious complications or delays in proper medical diagnosis are not likely to occur if
the symptoms of external vaginal itching are treated with OTC drug products, one comment cited the safe marketing
experience of OTC hydrocortisone products labeled with an indication that included ``external genital (feminine)
itching.'' The comment stated that none of the possible problems projected, i.e., the masking of serious disease,
the inability to self-diagnose, and the presumed side effects of the drug, had materialized since the marketing of
OTC hydrocortisone began in 1979. Several comments also argued that external vaginal itching and irritation are
not necessarily caused by infection, but can often be caused by irritating clothing, sensitivities to cosmetics,
inappropriate hygiene, or other external factors.
 In contrast, several comments stated that women should never self-treat the symptoms of vaginal itching, irritation,
or soreness because they are not capable of self-diagnosis (i.e., specifically determining an appropriate drug
product to use based on various vaginal symptoms) and should always be evaluated by a physician. The comments added
that self-treatment could unreasonably delay a proper diagnosis and could even complicate it.
 The agency notes that all of the products submitted to the Vaginal Panel were intended for intravaginal use and with
the exception of vaginal contraceptives, the use of these OTC vaginal products, e.g., douches, suppositories, had
been for the most part limited to cosmetic purposes, e.g., cleansing, deodorizing, mechanical flushing. Thus, the
agency concludes that with the exception of indications relating to minor itching, irritation, and soreness, all
other recommended vaginal monograph indications listed in the Vaginal Panel's report (48 FR 46694 at 46729) are cosmetic
in nature or outside the scope of the OTC drug review, e.g., ``Astringent,'' ``Removes vaginal discharge,'' ``Removes
vaginal secretions,'' ``Mild detergent action.'' Such indications for vaginal products refer to a product's transitory
cleansing effects rather than to claimed therapeutic effects. (See drug/cosmetic discussion in comment 2.) Therefore,
except for some ``astringent'' claims (see comment 13), the agency considers these indications outside the scope
of the OTC drug review. The agency has no objection to the continued availability of vaginal products bearing labeling
claims related to cleansing for cosmetic purposes, but does not believe that these cosmetic products should be labeled
or used for therapeutic purposes except under the advice and supervision of a physician. As a result of this withdrawal
notice, manufacturers may need to relabel or reformulate some products now or in the future. However, if reformulation
and/or relabeling are necessary, the cost will be minimal because reformulation and relabeling will be required,
in any event, under other appropriate rulemakings. 
 The agency believes that consumers should have access to OTC drug products to provide temporary relief of vaginal
itching and irritation. The agency recognizes that the safe marketing experience of hydrocortisone, which has been
available OTC since 1979 with an indication that includes use on itchy anal and genital areas, provides support that
serious complications or delays in proper medical diagnosis are not likely to occur if the symptom of vaginal itching
is treated with OTC drug products. Therefore, based on the available data and information, the agency believes that
the relief of vaginal symptoms such as itching and irritation is an acceptable labeling claim for certain OTC drug
products. 
 As stated above, all of the products submitted to the Vaginal Panel were intended for intravaginal use and concerns
arose about self-diagnosis, selection of an appropriate drug product, and self-treatment of intravaginal disorders.
The Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee (the Committee), in a meeting held June 14 and 15, 1990,
discussed the proposal that vaginal fungicides be sold OTC for the treatment of yeast (

Candida

) infections. Although a mechanism for initial self-diagnosis was not considered, the Committee believed that consumers
could safely and adequately recognize and treat subsequent intravaginal yeast infections after an initial diagnosis
had been made by a physician and recommended that vaginal antifungal drug products whose safety was well-established
be made available OTC with appropriate labeling (Ref. 1). Based on the Committee's recommendations and other available
data, the agency has determined that certain OTC drug products for intravaginal use to treat yeast infections or for
the relief of minor irritation, itching, and soreness can be safely used OTC. However, as recommended above, the agency
believes that antifungal or other drug product ingredients for OTC intravaginal use are appropriate only for those
women who have previously been diagnosed by a physician as having had the condition for which these drug products are
intended and are therefore able to subsequently recognize the symptoms of the condition. The agency intends to discuss
proposed labeling and specific ingredients for OTC intravaginal use in an amendment to the final monograph for OTC
antifungal drug products in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

.
 While a number of ingredients in OTC drug products could be used in and around the vagina to relieve symptoms such as
itching, irritation, or soreness, the use of these ingredients is not specific or unique to the vaginal area; i.e.,
they could be used topically to relieve these same symptoms elsewhere on the body. For example, antifungals, antipruritics,
skin protectants, and astringents all have potential for relieving symptoms occurring externally around the vagina
as well as on other parts of the body. It should be noted, however, that certain drug product classes, e.g., antifungals,
may be capable of relieving itching and irritation by means of killing the cause of the itch (e.g., yeast/fungus).
These products would not be expected to be routinely effective in treating ``itch'' due to other causes, e.g., poison
ivy, eczema, insect bites, etc. 
Also, in other OTC drug rulemakings, the agency has included, where appropriate, the various conditions for which
an ingredient is considered generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use in one monograph. (See, for example,
the discussion on hydrocortisone for use in psoriasis (51 FR 27346 at 27360) and the discussion on menstrual claims
for internal analgesics (53 FR 46204 at 46209).) Therefore, for those ingredients that are considered safe and effective
for use in relieving conditions in and around the vagina, the agency believes it is more appropriate to include a vaginal
claim in the applicable OTC drug monograph rather than to have a separate monograph for ingredients and claims related
to vaginal use only. (See, for example, ``external feminine itching'' claims for hydrocortisone products included
in the tentative final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (48 FR 5852 at 5868).)
 Therefore, based on the discussion above, the agency is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for
OTC vaginal drug products, which indicated the intention to create new subpart B of proposed part 351. This withdrawal
reflects the agency's intention regarding the language previously published for potential codification in part
351, but does not negate or reject the advisory panel's report. Specific vaginal claims for the various pharmacologic
classes of ingredients will be considered in other appropriate monographs. Because the issues raised by the comments
may significantly affect these other OTC drug rulemakings, the agency believes it is useful to respond to these issues
in this document. These issues and the agency's response to them will also be discussed in other appropriate OTC drug
rulemakings. Interested persons may, at that time, submit comments to the applicable rulemakings.

and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee, dated June 14-15, 1990, in OTC Vol. 11BTFM.


 4. Several comments supported the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products
(the Antimicrobial II Panel) that proposed a prescription to OTC switch of certain topical antifungal drugs for treating
external feminine itching associated with a yeast infection (47 FR 12480). These comments stressed that candidal
(yeast) infections of the vagina are extremely common and recurrent and that women can recognize with reasonable
certainty when they have a yeast infection, especially if they have had one before.
 The agency is aware that all three OTC advisory review panels charged with reviewing products that could be used in
or around the vagina concluded that vaginal infections could not be self-diagnosed or self-treated. The panels'
conclusions are consistent with FDA policy that infections in general should not be self-diagnosed by consumers
or self-treated with OTC drug products. The only exception to this general policy is the OTC use of topical antifungals
for treating athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The Antimicrobial II Panel that reviewed topical antifungal
drug products and FDA have determined that these infections are so common and recurrent that they are amenable to self-diagnosis
and treatment. In addition, the Antimicrobial II Panel recommended that haloprogin, miconazole, and nystatin be
switched from prescription to OTC status for external feminine itching associated with a yeast infection. The Antimicrobial
II Panel did not recommend these ingredients for treatment of the infection itself, but believed that OTC availability
of these ingredients would be beneficial in providing rapid symptomatic relief of itching. The issue of consumer
diagnosis of recurrent infections after appropriate physician diagnosis of the initial infection was not discussed
during any of the panels' consideration of this issue.
 The Antimicrobial II Panel also recommended that haloprogin, miconazole, and nystatin be available OTC for the treatment
of superficial skin infections caused by yeast (

Candida

) (47 FR 12480 at 12565) However, the agency concluded in the tentative final monograph for OTC antifungal drug products
(54 FR 51136 at 51140) that no antifungal ingredient should be labeled for OTC use for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis.
However, the agency stated that cutaneous candidiasis claims for effective antifungal ingredients could appropriately
be included in professional labeling. As stated in comment 3, in light of the recommendations of the Committee, the
agency has reevaluated its position on the availability of antifungal drug products for OTC treatment of vaginal
yeast (

Candida

) infections. The antifungal ingredients clotrimazole and miconazole nitrate, at specific concentrations, have
been approved for OTC intravaginal use, for specific indications, under new drug applications (Refs. 1 and 2).

 5. One comment disagreed with the Vaginal Panel's recommendation that ingredients classified as Category II for
use in OTC vaginal drug products be removed automatically from vaginal cosmetic products (48 FR 46694 at 46710). The
comment stated that this action is unwarranted because the safety of cosmetic ingredients is assured by the manufacturers,
who consider not only the scientific analyses done by the OTC advisory panels and FDA, but also additional published
and unpublished data that may not have been reviewed by the panels. The comment also contended that the specific use
of an ingredient in a cosmetic may differ from its use in a drug product.
 The agency notes that the Vaginal Panel made this recommendation in discussing Category II combination vaginal drug
products. The Vaginal Panel recommended to the agency that any Category II ingredient that causes a combination product
to be placed in Category II for safety reasons be removed from products regardless of whether they are intended for
use as a drug or a cosmetic because of concerns about protecting consumers from unsafe ingredients. While sharing
the Vaginal Panel's concern, the agency agrees with the comment that automatic removal of Category II drug ingredients
from cosmetic products is not warranted because other factors need to be considered. For example, while an ingredient
may not be safe in one concentration for use as a drug, it may be acceptable for use at a lower concentration in a cosmetic
product. However, the agency will look carefully at any ingredients that are present in cosmetic products when those
ingredients have been found unsafe for use in OTC drug products. FDA is prepared to take appropriate regulatory action
in preventing the use of ingredients in cosmetic products when a potential health hazard is known to exist with their
continued use. (See 21 CFR part 700_subpart B.) 
 6. One comment stated that the Vaginal Panel ``may have inappropriately suggested the need for effectiveness testing
for vaginal drug product final formulations'' (48 FR 46694 at 46724 and 46725). The comment stressed that the OTC drug
review is intended to be an active ingredient review and that testing is not necessary for final formulations of these
products.
 In discussing testing guidelines for vaginal douche products, the Vaginal Panel simply stated that it did not require
effectiveness testing for douches that make only cosmetic claims, e.g., ``cleansing.'' However, the Vaginal Panel
recommended that effectiveness testing should be required for those ingredients in vaginal douches that make drug
claims, e.g., ``relieving irritation.''
 As discussed in comment 3, the agency is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug
products and is referring consideration of specific claims and ingredients for use in and around the vagina to other
appropriate OTC drug rulemakings. Any necessary final formulation testing will also be discussed in those rulemakings,
e.g., ingredients used in vaginal antiseptic drug products.



 B. Comments on Active Ingredients


 7. Two comments objected to the Vaginal Panel's conclusion that data are insufficient to prove the safety of quaternary
ammonium compounds (i.e., benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and methylbenzethonium chloride) for
vaginal use (48 FR 46694 at 46717). The comments stated that although the Vaginal Panel's concern was based on published
literature reports where the use of these compounds was associated with infections caused by 

Pseudomonas

, it was not scientifically sound to use these reports to conclude that a safety problem exists. The comments mentioned
that the Vaginal Panel failed to state that these reports resulted from the contamination of solutions that were employed
in laboratory and hospital settings to sterilize medical devices used in urinary and cardiac catheterization or
cystoscopic or related invasive procedures. Such procedures are usually conducted on patients whose normal body
defenses have been compromised. Because 

Pseudomonas

 infections occur primarily in debilitated patients and 

Pseudomonas

 does not cause vulvovaginitis, the comments stated that it is scientifically inappropriate to cite these reports
and through extrapolation conclude that the use of quaternary ammonium compounds in vaginal drug products presents
a health hazard to normal individuals. 
 The comments cited several references (Refs. 1 through 7) to show that the Vaginal Panel's concerns with respect to
vaginal contamination by 

Pseudomonas

 in the presence of quaternary ammonium compounds are not supported by the weight of scientific data. The comments
added that extensive toxicological studies on these compounds have been published (Ref. 8). The comments requested
the agency to affirm the safety of quaternary ammonium compounds and classify them as Category I for use in relieving
minor irritations of the vagina.
 Another comment stated that quaternary ammonium compounds historically have been included in vaginal products
as preservatives and that these ingredients should be allowed to continue to be used for this purpose.
 The agency agrees with the comments' reasoning that the reports cited by the Vaginal Panel about 

Pseudomonas

 infections are not adequate to conclude that the use of quaternary ammonium compounds in OTC vaginal drug products
may present a health hazard to normal individuals. The agency has no objection to the continued use of quaternary ammonium
compounds as preservatives in OTC drug and cosmetic products provided the products are manufactured in accordance
with established procedures that assure the adequacy of preservative systems and microbial limits of products.
 With respect to the use of quaternary ammonium compounds as active ingredients in OTC vaginal drug products for relieving
symptoms of itching, irritation, or soreness, the Vaginal Panel stated that it was unaware of any data that demonstrated
effectiveness for these uses (48 FR 46694 at 46718). The comments did not include any new data, and the agency is unaware
of any such data.
 As explained in comment 3, the agency has decided to consider specific vaginal claims for the various ingredients
in other appropriate rulemakings. Quaternary ammonium compounds are included as Category I ingredients in the tentative
final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). Any comments or new data received regarding specific vaginal use of quaternary ammonium
compounds will be considered by the agency in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products.

 8. One comment supported the Vaginal Panel's Category I classification of potassium sorbate (48 FR 46694 at 46704)
and disagreed with the agency's conclusion that potassium sorbate is a new drug because it has not been marketed as
a drug to a material extent and for a material time in the United States (48 FR 46694 at 46695). The comment stated that
a product containing potassium sorbate had been marketed for over 2 years and that this ingredient is generally recognized
as safe and effective for the treatment of minor vaginal itching and irritation and should be included as a monograph
ingredient. The comment contended that potassium sorbate is safe because it was so recognized by the Vaginal Panel,
and because of the lack of ``any report of major side effects, adverse reaction or complaint'' while 14 million units
of a product containing this ingredient were sold for over 2 years before marketing was discontinued. The comment
argued that potassium sorbate is effective because it was so recognized by the Vaginal Panel based on two adequate
and well-controlled clinical studies (48 FR 46694 at 46704). The comment added that this ingredient has been historically
used by physicians for treatment of vaginal itching and irritation, and that this professional use constitutes use
``for a material time and to a material extent.'' The comment also argued that potassium sorbate is safer than povidone-iodine,
which the Vaginal Panel recommended as a Category I ingredient for these uses. The comment concluded that potassium
sorbate is not a new drug because of its historical use and because of its marketing history, and should be placed in
Category I as a monograph ingredient.
 In the preamble to the Vaginal Panel's report (48 FR 46694 at 46695), the agency stated its opinion as follows:


 The agency is not aware of the marketing of any drug product containing potassium sorbate as an active ingredient prior
to adoption of the Panel's report, although at least one product has entered the marketplace since that time. Because
potassium sorbate has not been marketed as a drug to a material extent and for a material time in the United States, the
agency considers this ingredient to be a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)). It may not be marketed until FDA has approved a new drug application (NDA) for such
use.


 The agency has not at this time changed its position on potassium sorbate for the treatment of minor vaginal itching
and irritation. However, issues about the agency's interpretations regarding marketing to a ``material extent''
and for a ``material time'' as threshold criteria for inclusion of an ingredient in the OTC drug review have been raised
in a number of rulemakings. Citizen petitions (Refs. 1 and 2) have been filed requesting the agency to change its longstanding
position on these threshold criteria, especially with regard to permitting foreign marketing to satisfy the material
time and extent criteria. The agency intends to address the material time and extent issues in a consolidated response
in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

.

 9. One comment requested that Category I approval of povidone-iodine as an active ingredient for the relief of minor
irritations of the vagina be extended to include a vaginal suppository as well as a douche dosage form. The comment
stated that the absorption potential with a suppository dosage form should be no greater than with a vaginal douche,
and that there is no basis for making a distinction between a suppository and a douche dosage form with respect to effectiveness.
 In response to a comment comparing the relative safety of potassium sorbate to povidone-iodine (see comment 8), one
comment contended that the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the other comment with respect to povidone-iodine
were superficial and erroneous and were in disregard of the facts. The comment stated that over 1,000 published studies
and over 30 years of experience demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine and confirm its Category
I status for vaginal use as a douche.
 Povidone-iodine in various formulations for vaginal use, i.e., douche and gel, was originally reviewed under the
FDA Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). The DESI panel concluded that povidone-iodine was effective as a
douche, i.e., for cleansing purposes, and that povidone-iodine could offer some partial or temporary relief of itching
and odor when infection was present. Only the douche formulation was deferred for consideration to the OTC drug review.
In the 

Federal Register

 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694 at 46705), the Vaginal Panel reviewed the povidone-iodine douche product (0.15 to
3 percent) and placed it in Category I for the relief of minor irritations of the vagina. The Vaginal Panel did not review
povidone-iodine in a suppository dosage form because no data on this dosage form were submitted. However, the Vaginal
Panel did consider the suppository dosage form for claims relating to relief of minor irritation, and reduction of
number of pathogenic microorganisms, and stated that such claims must be substantiated by testing (48 FR 46694 at
46702). The safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine for the relief of itching and minor irritation in and around
the vagina will be discussed by the agency in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products in a future
issue of the 

Federal Register

. (See also discussion in comment 17 regarding professional labeling claims.)


 C. Comments on Labeling


 10. One comment objected to the Vaginal Panel's recommendation that OTC drugs be labeled with the components of perfumes
that are included in the products. The comment explained that fragrances and flavors are often made up of dozens of
ingredients and that to list each of these individually would be a practical impossibility; furthermore, the composition
of a perfume is a significant trade secret. The comment pointed out that this issue had been considered and rejected
by Congress and FDA on several occasions over the past decade, and concluded that there was no reason whatsoever to
change these previous decisions.
 Because section 502(e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)) specifies the requirements for the labeling of active and inactive
ingredients in drug products, there is no need to include such requirements in an OTC drug monograph. However, the
agency notes that although section 502(e) of the act does not require the complete identification of all inactive
ingredients in the labeling of OTC drugs, it does require the disclosure of certain ingredients, whether included
as active or inactive components in a drug product. Although FDA does not require the inclusion of all the inactive
ingredients in OTC drug product labeling, the agency urges manufacturers to list all inactive ingredients voluntarily
as recommended by the Vaginal Panel. This information will enable the consumer with known allergies or intolerance
to certain ingredients to select products with increased confidence of safe use.
 After the Vaginal Panel made its recommendations to FDA, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA)
(formerly the Proprietary Association), the trade association that represents OTC drug manufacturers who reportedly
market 90 to 95 percent of all OTC drug products sold in the United States, implemented a program under which its member
companies voluntarily list inactive ingredients in the labeling of OTC drug products under guidelines established
by NDMA (Ref. 1). Although these guidelines do not specify the listing of each ingredient contained in the fragrance
or perfume in the product, they do provide for such inactive ingredients as flavors and fragrances to be listed as ``flavors''
and ``fragrances.'' Hence, the consumer with known allergies or intolerances to such inactive ingredients as flavors,
fragrances, or perfumes would be generally aware of their inclusion in certain OTC drug products. The agency commends
these voluntary efforts and urges all OTC drug manufacturers to label their products voluntarily in accordance with
NDMA's guidelines.

 11. Several comments argued that FDA cannot legally and should not, as a matter of policy, prescribe exclusive lists
of terms from which statements of identity and indications for use of OTC drug products must be drawn and prohibit alternative
OTC labeling terminology which is truthful, not misleading, and intelligible to the consumer to describe such indications.
Two comments argued that such a restriction is an unconstitutional restriction of commercial speech and exceeds
FDA's authority. One comment stated that this ``exclusivity policy'' is not warranted as a matter of sound public
policy, and recommended that FDA follow a guideline labeling policy instead of an exclusive one. One comment objected
that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking was more restrictive in limiting the ``statements of identity'' than
is the regulation in  201.61 (21 CFR 201.61). The comment urged the agency to allow manufacturers the alternative
ways of describing the statements of identity that are allowed in  201.61.
 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications
for use of OTC drug products. Under  330.1(c)(2) (21 CFR 330.1(c)(2)), the label and labeling of OTC drug products
are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuous location, either: (1) The specific wording on indications
for use established under an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES'';
(2) other wording describing such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading
labeling, which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVED USES''; or (3) the approved
monograph language on indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternative
language describing indications for use that is not false or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling.
All other OTC drug labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity, warnings, and
directions) must appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where
exact language has been established and identified by quotation marks, e.g.,   201.63 or 330.1(g).
 12. One comment stated that FDA's exclusivity policy is a drug labeling policy that has no application to cosmetic
claims appearing in the labeling of products that are both cosmetics and drugs.
 The agency agrees with the comment that the labeling restrictions in OTC drug monographs apply only to products that
fall within the statutory definition of ``drugs'' and not to cosmetic products. This distinction between drugs and
cosmetics is discussed in comment 3.
 Final OTC drug monographs cover only the drug use of the active ingredients listed therein. The concentration range,
limitations, statements of identity, indications, warnings, and directions established for these ingredients
in a monograph do not apply to the use of the same ingredients in products intended solely as cosmetics. However, if
a product is intended for both drug and cosmetic use, it must conform to the requirements of the applicable final monograph(s).
In addition to any indications allowed for OTC drug products bearing claims for vaginal use, such products may also
bear appropriate labeling for cosmetic use(s), in conformity with section 602 of the act and the provisions of parts
701 and 740. In accordance with the final rule on the agency's exclusivity policy (51 FR 16258, May 1, 1986), cosmetic
claims may not appear within the boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES.'' As discussed at 51 FR 16258 at 16264 (paragraph
14), cosmetic claims may appear elsewhere in the labeling but not in the box should manufacturers choose the labeling
alternative provided in  330.1(c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(iii) for labeling cosmetic drug products. 
 13. One comment agreed with the Vaginal Panel's conclusions that the terms ``cleansing,'' ``producing soothing
and refreshing effects,'' and ``deodorizing'' (as used in the definitions of vaginal douche and vaginal suppository)
are cosmetic claims (48 FR 46694 at 46701). The comment urged the agency to accept the Vaginal Panel's recommendation.
In addition to the claims above, another comment also considered the claim ``producing an astringent effect'' to
be a cosmetic claim. The comment argued that these claims do not make a vaginal product into a drug, that it is legally
inappropriate to include them in the definitions of these products in proposed  351.103 of the monograph, and
that they should be removed from the definitions section and anywhere else they appear in the document.
 The agency agrees that cosmetic claims should not be included in OTC drug rulemakings. Therefore, the cosmetic claims
``cleansing,'' ``soothing,'' ``refreshing,'' and ``deodorizing'' will not be included in OTC drug monographs.
The agency believes, however, that astringency can be either a drug claim or a cosmetic claim, depending on the intended
use and labeling of the product. For example, astringent products intended and labeled for the relief of minor vaginal
irritation or reduction in local edema would be considered as drugs, while astringent products intended and labeled
for a refreshing effect would be considered as cosmetics. A product making both claims would be both a drug and a cosmetic.
Thus, the agency will consider the intended use in determining whether it is a cosmetic, a drug, or both (see also comment
3).
 14. One comment stated that the Vaginal Panel's categorization of cosmetic claims as Category II drug claims is inappropriate
because cosmetic claims are not within the jurisdiction of the OTC drug review. The comment contended that the following
claims were inappropriately classified as Category II drug claims by the Vaginal Panel (48 FR 46694 at 46710) because
these claims are really cosmetic claims:


 Effectively cleanses
Effectively deodorizes
Cleans thoroughly
Destroys odor
Continued vaginal cleanliness
Cleanses more thoroughly than other douches 
Removes contraceptive jellies and creams
Changes water into a cleansing solution
Complete feminine hygiene
Personal hygiene
Hypoallergenic
Feminine hygiene
Intimate cleanliness
Prevents disagreeable odors
Effective germ killer
Routine feminine hygiene
Completely refreshed 


 The comment also contended that the Vaginal Panel placed the following ``other product quality claims'' in Category
II and that these claims do not belong in the rulemaking because they are not drug claims:


Fortified triple strength
Scientifically balanced formula
Intimately understood
Changes water into a cleansing solution
Naturally safe ingredients


Formula like the natural environment in
 

your body 


Ph of 3.5
Effective liquid
Nonacid


Intended for all women who want to enjoy  extra confidence in meeting people
As with all vaginal douches, its function is not to cover up odor
 Unlike spray deodorants which offer less protection


Complete feminine daintiness
Clinically tested
Dainty and feminine
Gentle
Safe for delicate membranes
Contains only the mildest ingredients
 

 Completely compatible with normal vaginal environment


Buffered to control a normal vaginal pH


 Stating that the Vaginal Panel did not provide a reason for its recommendation, the comment requested that reference
to these claims be deleted at the next stage of the rulemaking.
 Although there will not be another stage in this rulemaking, the comment's concerns regarding these label terms are
relevant to vaginal claims for OTC drug products subject to other OTC drug monographs. Therefore, the agency believes
it is pertinent to address the comment's concerns.
 The OTC drug review establishes conditions under which some OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective
and not misbranded. Two principal conditions examined during the review are allowable ingredients and allowable
labeling. FDA has determined that it is not practical_in terms of time, resources, and other considerations_to set
standards for all labeling found in OTC drug products. Accordingly, OTC drug monographs regulate only labeling related
in a significant way to the safe and effective use of covered products by lay persons. OTC drug monographs establish
allowable labeling for the following items: product statement of identity; names of active ingredients; indications
for use; directions for use; warnings against unsafe use, side effects, and adverse reactions; and claims concerning
mechanism of drug action. The agency agrees with the comment that some of the claims listed above are either solely
cosmetic claims or do not relate in a significant way to the safe and effective use of OTC vaginal drug products and,
therefore, are outside the scope of the OTC drug review. Although these terms are considered outside the scope of the
review, if used in the labeling of OTC drug products they will be evaluated by the agency on a product-by-product basis,
under the provision of section 502 of the act relating to labeling that is false or misleading. Moreover, any term that
is outside the scope of the review, even though it is truthful and not misleading, may not appear in any portion of the
labeling required by a monograph and may not detract from such required information. However, terms outside the scope
of a monograph may be included elsewhere in the labeling, provided they are not false or misleading. In addition, as
explained in comment 2, the labeling restrictions in final monographs apply only to products that fall within the
statutory definition of a drug, and not to cosmetic products. However, if a product is intended for both drug and cosmetic
use, it must conform not only to the requirements of the applicable final monographs, but also to section 602 of the
act and the regulations in parts 701 and 740.
 15. One comment contended that the use of the adjective ``vaginal'' modifying ``douche'' in the statement of identity
in  351.152(a) is unnecessary and superfluous because, in common language usage, the word ``douche'' has become
synonymous with vaginal use. The comment added that the agency has codified this class of products as ``douche preparations''
in 21 CFR 369.20. The comment requested that the statement of identity allow for synonyms for ``vaginal douche'' such
as ``feminine douche,'' ``disposable douche,'' and ``douche.'' The comment argued that the term ``vaginal douche''
may be too sensitive for certain advertising media and that the requested synonyms plus the accompanying labeling
would clearly define the product as intended for vaginal use only.
 The agency recognizes the sensitivity to use of the word ``vaginal'' and will take this into consideration in developing
labeling in the appropriate OTC drug monographs. (See, e.g., the labeling developed for hydrocortisone in the tentative
final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (48 FR 5852 at 5868).)
 16. One comment objected to the Vaginal Panel's recommendation in proposed  351.152(b) that the two statements
``Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children'' and ``DOES NOT PREVENT PREGNANCY'' appear on the principal
display panel of OTC vaginal drug products. The comment argued that including such statements on the principal display
panel is contrary to labeling requirements in other OTC drug regulations now in effect in that statements such as these
are generally required to be displayed in a warnings section next to the directions for use. The comment further argued
that vaginal douche products have not been shown less safe than or different from other OTC drug products to the extent
that would necessitate inclusion of separate warning statements. The comment requested that the Vaginal Panel's
recommended that proposed  351.152(b) be deleted and that these statements be included with the recommended
label warnings in proposed  351.154(a).
 The agency agrees with the comment that special placement of these warning statements on the principal display panel
is unwarranted. The Vaginal Panel recommended that the statement ``Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children''
appear on the principal display panel because the attractiveness and colorful appearance of many vaginal drug products
may encourage children to open and consume the contents (48 FR 46694 at 46708). The agency is unaware of any evidence
that OTC vaginal drug products are any more attractive or more likely to be opened and consumed by children than other
OTC drug products. Therefore, the agency has determined that there is no need for special placement of this general
warning statement in the labeling of OTC vaginal drug products. Because existing regulations in  330.1(g)
(21 CFR 330.1(g)) already require all OTC drugs to contain the warning ``Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children,''
there is no need to include this warning in individual OTC drug monographs.
 However, because the Vaginal Panel was concerned that there is a commonly held misconception by some people that douching
prevents pregnancy (48 FR 46694 at 46708), the agency encourages manufacturers to voluntarily place the warning
``DOES NOT PREVENT PREGNANCY'' in the labeling of vaginal douche products. The agency will discuss vaginal drug product
labeling regarding prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases as part of the rulemaking for OTC antifungal
drug products in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

.
 17. One comment urged deletion of the Vaginal Panel's recommended professional labeling statement in proposed  351.180(b)(3),
which reads: ``The use of povidone-iodine as a douche may cause a transient rise of serum protein-bound iodine.''
The comment argued that in view of the Vaginal Panel's conclusion that a transient rise in serum protein-bound iodine
levels (observed in some individuals) does not affect the safety of the drug and has not been shown to have clinical
significance with respect to thyroid function (48 FR 46694 at 46705), the statement is unwarranted. The comment added
that inclusion of such a statement in professional labeling is misleading because it directs unwarranted emphasis
to an essentially meaningless event.
 The comment also stated that if the agency decides not to delete this statement, the statement should be amended to
read as follows: ``While not affecting its safety, the use of povidone-iodine as a douche may cause a transient rise
in serum protein-bound iodine in some individuals. Such transient elevation returns to normal within 7 to 30 days
and there is no evidence that this has clinical significance with respect to thyroid function.'' The comment contended
that this revised statement would present the full clinical significance of the rise in serum protein-bound iodine
according to the Vaginal Panel's stated findings.
 As discussed in comment 9, the agency intends to consider povidone-iodine for vaginal use in the rulemaking for OTC
topical antimicrobial drug products in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

. In the tentative final monographs in which povidone-iodine is a Category I ingredient (antifungal (54 FR 51136,
December 12, 1989) and first aid antiseptic (56 FR 33644, July 22, 1991)), a statement regarding the transient rise
in protein-bound iodine associated with the use of povidone-iodine has not been included in professional labeling.
Any other professional labeling associated with vaginal use of povidone-iodine will be considered as part of the
antimicrobial rulemaking and will not be further considered here.


 D. Comments on Combinations


 18. One comment requested that the Vaginal Panel's recommended list of permitted combinations in proposed  351.120
be amended to provide for combinations of one Category I ingredient from any two, three, or four of the various pharmacologic
classes. The comment stated that there is adequate precedent in the OTC drug review for combining Category I ingredients
from one pharmacological class with Category I ingredients from another pharmacological class, without the necessity
of elaborate testing of the combination.
 As explained in comment 3, the agency is withdrawing the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug
products and is referring consideration of specific vaginal claims to other appropriate OTC drug rulemakings. Likewise,
combinations of ingredients for vaginal claims will be considered in those respective rulemakings and will not be
considered here.
 19. The agency recognizes that the Vaginal Panel recommended some professional labeling indications for several
of the ingredients it reviewed. (See Proposed  351.180, 48 FR 46694 at 46729.) For a combination product containing
the ingredients dioctyl sodium sulfo
