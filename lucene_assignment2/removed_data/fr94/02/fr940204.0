Political Activity of Federal Employees



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim regulations with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations concerning the political activities of
Federal employees to reflect changes resulting from the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, which President Clinton
signed on October 6, 1993. The scope of these interim regulations is limited to matters concerning exemptions for
employees residing in certain localities, from the prohibitions specified in the amended 5 U.S.C. 7323(a) (2) and
(3) on candidacy for partisan political office and on soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, the Director finds that good cause exists for waiving
the general notice of proposed rulemaking. The notice is being waived because of the limited time in which to issue
regulations, and OPM's desire that current partial exemptions for the Federally employed residents of designated
localities continue in effect without interruption.



The Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103-94, specifically authorize OPM to issue regulations
on the political activities of Federal employees with regard to the matters specified in 5 U.S.C. 7325, as amended,
concerning Federal employees' participation in local elections of certain localities in which they reside. Section
12(a) of the Reform Amendments provides that the regulatory authority granted by the amended 5 U.S.C. 7325 shall take
effect on the date of the enactment of the Amendments. 

The title of Part 733 has been changed accordingly to reflect that the interim regulations concern the political activity
of Federal employees who reside in designated localities. The authority statement also has been changed to show that
OPM's authority to issue these regulations is 5 U.S.C. 7325, as amended. Section 733.101 of the interim regulations
includes definitions of ``employee,'' ``political contribution,'' and ``partisan political office'' which correspond
with the definitions in the Reform Amendments. The definition of ``employee'' further reflects that employees of
the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission specifically are covered under the Reform Amendments.


The Reform Amendments permit active participation in partisan political activities but prohibit employees from
seeking public office in partisan elections. Although the Reform Amendments authorize OPM to issue regulations
permitting employees to run as partisan political candidates for local office, section 10 of the Amendments reflects
the intent of the Senate that employees should not be authorized to run for a local partisan political office, except
as expressly provided under current law. 

The Hatch Act, at 5 U.S.C. 7327, currently authorizes OPM to prescribe regulations permitting the Federally employed
residents of designated localities to participate actively in local partisan elections, and does not require employees
to run as independent candidates in these elections. However, regulations promulgated under the Hatch Act included
this requirement. In view of section 10 of the Reform Amendments, OPM believes that candidacy for partisan political
office in local elections should be limited to independent candidacies. Paragraph (a)(1) of  733.102 of the
interim regulations accordingly permits employees who reside in designated localities to run for partisan political
office in local elections, but only as independent candidates. 

Paragraph (a)(2) of  733.102 permits these employees to accept or receive political contributions in connection
with partisan elections for local public office. In view of the intent of the Senate that Federal employees should
not be permitted to solicit political contributions from the general public, OPM has prohibited the solicitation
of political contributions from the general public in paragraph (b). Paragraph (c) specifies that candidacy for,
and service in, a partisan political office shall not result in neglect of, or interference with, the performance
of the duties of the employee or create a conflict, or apparent conflict, of interest. Paragraph (d) specifies the
conditions under which OPM may designate localities in which employees may participate more actively in local partisan
elections, and also incorporates the existing list of designated localities. 

Although the Reform Amendments permit most Federal employees to participate actively in political management or
in political campaigns, Federal employees in specified agencies and offices are prohibited from such participation.
Therefore,  733.103 of the interim regulations excludes these employees from coverage under part 733. 

Finally, subparts B and C are removed from the part 733 because they clearly are outdated. Subpart B concerns violations
of the Hatch Act by excepted service employees, and subpart C applies the Hatch Act's prohibitions to Postal Service
employees. 



E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation



I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they relate to internal personnel matters within the Federal Government.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations for delegations of authority relating to general
redelegations of authority from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs by making revisions to the regulations on initial
emergency permit orders and notices of confirmation of effective date of final regulations on food matters. This
amendment to the regulations will include foods for animal as well as human consumption and will add the Director and
Deputy Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), to those already delegated authority. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is amending the regulations in  5.62 

Issuance of initial emergency permit orders and notices of confirmation of effective date of final regulations on
food matters

 (21 CFR 5.62) to include foods for animal as well as human consumption, and to give the Director and Deputy Director,
CVM authority to issue initial emergency permit orders under  508.5 (21 CFR 508.5) and to confirm the effective
date of final regulations on animal food matters.


This document is issued as a final rule because the rulemaking requirements in 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply to rules of agency
organization, procedure, or practice.

Further redelegation of the authority delegated is not authorized. Authority delegated to a position by title may
be exercised by a person officially designated to serve in such position in an acting capacity or on a temporary basis.



List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 5


Authority delegations (Government agencies), Imports, Organization and functions (Government agencies).




Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs, 21 CFR part 5 is amended as follows:

(42 U.S.C. 300aa-1 note).



2. Section 5.62 is amended by revising the section heading and the text, by redesignating the text as paragraph (a),
and by adding new paragraph (b) to read as follows:

emergency permit orders under  108.5 of this chapter and notices of confirmation of effective date of final
regulations on human food matters promulgated under section 701(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the
act). 
(b) The Director and Deputy Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine, are authorized to issue initial emergency
permit orders under  508.5 of this chapter for foods for animals and notices of confirmation of the effective

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is amending the regulations in  5.26 

Service fellowships

 (21 CFR 5.26) to redelegate two additional service fellowship authorities given to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs
in a January 8, 1993, memorandum, from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Management Operations, Public Health
Service. These authorities add to the authority to designate persons to receive service fellowships, the authorities
to appoint service fellows, and to determine specific stipend rates for individual actions within the ranges established
under an approved service fellowship plan. The authority to approve service fellowship plans and exceptions thereto
has not been redelegated to FDA. FDA is additionally amending  5.26 to reflect organizational changes within
the centers, and to add the Deputy Director for Regulations and Policy, Center for Devices and Radiological Health,
the Office Directors, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Director, Office of Human Resources
Management, Office of Management Systems, to those already delegated authority.

Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption; Dimethyl Dicarbonate


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of dimethyl
dicarbonate as a yeast inhibitor in ready-to-drink tea beverages. This action is in response to a petition filed by
Miles, Inc. (formerly Mobay Corp.).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 10, 1992 (57 FR 8460), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2A4310) had been filed by Miles, Inc.,
Mobay Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 15205-9741, proposing that the food additive regulations in  172.133 

Dimethyl dicarbonate

 (21 CFR 172.133) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyl dicarbonate as a yeast inhibitor in ready-to-drink
tea beverages.
As discussed in more detail below, FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes
that the proposed use of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) in ready-to-drink tea beverages is safe. 


II. Determination of Safety


Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called
``general safety clause,'' a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the
evidence establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define
safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended
conditions of use.''
The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides
that no food additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly,
however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself, not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an
additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, such additive is properly
evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive (

Scott

 v. 

FDA

, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)).


III. Safety of Dimethyl Dicarbonate in Ready-to-Drink Tea Beverages


Dimethyl dicarbonate is currently permitted as a yeast inhibitor in wine and wine substitutes (dealcoholized wine
and low alcohol wine) under  172.133. In the final rules establishing this regulation (53 FR 41325, October
21, 1988; and 58 FR 6088, January 26, 1993) the agency concluded that, because dimethyl dicarbonate decomposes almost
immediately after addition to beverages, there will be virtually no exposure of the consumer to the additive from
its use in wine and wine substitutes.
Data submitted in the petition concerning the use of the additive in tea beverages are consistent with these findings
in wine and wine substitutes. Specifically, data from a study on the hydrolysis of dimethyl dicarbonate in tea showed
no detectable amount of the additive after 4 hours (limit of analytical detectability = 40 parts per billion (ppb))
(Ref. 1). Based on these data, the agency concludes that there will be virtually no consumer exposure to dimethyl dicarbonate
from the use of the additive in ready-to-drink tea beverages. Therefore, FDA concludes that dimethyl dicarbonate
itself presents no hazard to the consumer. 


IV. Safety of Substances That May Be Present in Tea Beverages Due to the Use of the Additive


Dimethyl dicarbonate is unstable in aqueous solution and breaks down almost immediately after addition to beverages.
In aqueous liquids, the principal breakdown products are methanol and carbon dioxide. Methyl ethyl carbonate, as
well as carbomethoxy amino- and hydroxy-adducts of amines, sugars, and fruit acids may also be formed in minor amounts.
Dimethyl carbonate is present as an impurity in dimethyl dicarbonate. Dimethyl dicarbonate also may react with traces
of ammonia or ammonium ions to form trace quantities of methyl carbamate, a compound that has been shown to cause cancer
in laboratory animals (Ref. 2).
In approving the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in wine and wine substitutes, the agency, in accordance with 21 CFR 171.1,
reviewed the safety not only of dimethyl dicarbonate but also of its decomposition products in aqueous beverages.
The same analysis from that review was applied by the agency in reviewing the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate
in ready-to-drink tea beverages. The results of the agency's analysis of the additive's use in wine and wine substitutes
were discussed extensively in the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1988, and January 26, 1993, final rules, which are referenced; that analysis applies equally to the
evaluation of the petitioned use of DMDC. Aspects of the safety evaluation of the decompostion products that may result
from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages that were not discussed previously are discussed
below. 


A. Minor Reaction Products


In its previous evaluation of the safety of minor breakdown products of dimethyl dicarbonate in aqueous solutions,
the agency concluded that there is no evidence of added risk from exposure to those minor products. For this petition,
the agency also evaluated results from an acute toxicity study on a series of putative adducts (

N

-carbomethoxy conjugates of trigallic acid, glycine, glutamic acid, alanine, proline, asparagine, cysteine,
phenylalanine, arginine, leucine, and monocysteine) that may be formed by dimethyl dicarbonate when added to ready-to-drink
tea beverages. Results of the study showed that LD

50

 for each of the adducts in mice or rats ranged between 4,600 and >15,000 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg body
weight), thereby indicating the low order of acute toxicity of those substances (Ref. 3).


B. Methanol


FDA previously estimated that the total human exposure to methanol from consumption of food that naturally contains
methanol and of wine or wine substitutes that are treated with dimethyl dicarbonate to be 50 to 60 mg per person per day
(mg/person/day) (58 FR 6088). The tolerable (safe) level for methanol is 7.1 to 8.4 mg/kg body weight (426 to 504 mg/person/day
for a 60-kg adult) based on reports of studies in human subjects (Ref. 4). The agency estimates that the methanol exposure
from the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea would be 40 mg/person/day at tea intake of 332
grams(g)/person/day (90th percentile) (Ref. 1). This would increase the human exposure to methanol to 90 to 100 mg/person/day
(to approximately one-fifth of the tolerable safe level). The agency, therefore, concludes that there is an adequate
margin of safety between the methanol consumption from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate and the amount of methanol
that can be safely ingested (Ref. 4).


C. Methyl Carbamate


Methyl carbamate, a carcinogen, was detected in wines treated with dimethyl dicarbonate; based on a quantitative
risk assessment, the agency concluded that there was a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to methyl carbamate
in wines and wine substitutes (58 FR 6088 at 6090).
Methyl carbamate was not detected in dimethyl dicarbonate-treated ready-to-drink tea, using an analytical method
with a limit of detection of 5 ppb. Assuming that methyl carbamate could be present at 2.5 ppb (one-half the limit of
detection) and using an estimated value for intake of tea beverages (332 g/person/day (90th percentile)), FDA estimates
that the exposure to methyl carbamate from the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate would be no more than 0.8 microgram/person/day
(Ref. 1) for individuals consuming ready-to-drink tea at the 90th percentile level. Using the same principles and
quantitative risk assessment procedure that were applied to the wine and wine substitutes, as discussed in the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1988, and January 26, 1993, final rules, and the exposure to methyl carbamate estimated above, FDA estimates
that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to methyl carbamate from the use of
dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea is 7.8 x 10

-9

, or less than 1 in 128 million (Refs. 3, 5, and 6). 
Therefore, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to methyl carbamate
that may result from the use of up to 250 ppm of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages. 


D. Conclusion On Safety


FDA has evaluated all of the data in the petition pertaining to the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea
beverages and concludes that the additive is safe for its proposed use.
To ensure the safe use of the additive in ready-to-drink tea beverages, FDA, under 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(1)(A), is amending
 172.133(c)(2) to require directions on the food additive label limiting the level of use of the additive in
tea beverages to 250 ppm.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection. 


V. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


VI. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 7, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Limitation on Use of Appropriated Funds to Influence 
Certain Federal Contracting and Financial Transactions; 
Change in Threshold for Single Family Compliance 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule complies with a statutory amendment to raise, for single family mortgage transactions, the threshold for
compliance with the government-wide certification and disclosure requirements on lobbying.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 23, 1989, section 319 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal
Year 1990 (Pub. L. 101-121) was enacted. This provision amended subchapter III of chapter 13 of title 31, United
States Code, to add a new section 1352 (the ``Byrd Amendment''). The Byrd Amendment contains a general prohibition
on the use of federally appropriated funds for influencing any Executive or Legislative Branch personnel in the award
of Federal contracts, grants, loans, cooperative agreements, and certain post-award actions (such as the modification
or extension of any of these forms of assistance). It also requires disclosure of certain information on payments
from non-federally-appropriated funds that are used to influence the above Federal actions, as well as the insurance
or guarantee of loans. The Byrd Amendment applies to all Federal agencies and was implemented by a government-wide
common rule that was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 26, 1990, at 55 FR 6736. HUD's adoption of the common rule is set forth at 24 CFR part 87. 


Under the provisions of 24 CFR 87.110, each person who makes a submission for consideration of an award of a Federal
loan or a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan exceeding $150,000, or receives
such an award, must file a certification regarding the prohibition discussed above and a disclosure form (Standard
Form LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities''), if indicated by the use of non-federally-appropriated funds
to influence the covered actions. 
Section 320 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Pub. L. 101-512)
amended section 1352(e)(2)(c) of the Byrd Amendment to expand the original exception for loan guaranty and insurance
transactions of $150,000 or less to also except guaranty/insurance transactions when the amount is within the applicable
single family mortgage limit. Under HUD's new higher mortgage limits, transactions in a number of states could exceed
the $150,000 threshold. Accordingly 24 CFR 87.110 (a)(2) and (b)(2) are amended to reflect this technical change
by adding to the references to $150,000 ``or the single family maximum mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever
is greater.'' 


Other Matters 


Justification for Final Rule Making 


In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rule making, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary and contrary to public interest. This rule makes a technical amendment
in compliance with a statutory change which reduces the burden on the public. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule applies to single family mortgage transactions only and relieves the certification
and disclosure requirements which might have applied in some circumstances. 


Environmental Review 


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules
Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh
Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. This rule applies
to single family mortgage transactions for certain HUD programs only. 


Executive Order 12606, the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

Public and Indian Housing Program_Demolition or Disposition of Public and Indian Housing Projects_Required and
Permitted PHA/IHA Actions Prior to Approval; Extension of Delay of Effective Date



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; extension of delay of effective date of final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Existing regulations require that a PHA or IHA not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public or Indian housing
project or a portion of a public or Indian housing project without obtaining HUD approval under the provisions of 24
CFR parts 970 or 905, respectively. On November 4, 1993, the Department promulgated a final rule that clarifies that
until such time as HUD approval may be obtained, the PHA or IHA must not take any action intended to further the demolition
or disposition of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining HUD approval
under 24 CFR parts 970 or 905, respectively. Furthermore, until such time as HUD approval is obtained, the PHA or IHA
must prevent further deterioration of the physical condition of the project, other than deterioration incident
to normal use, and is responsible under the ACC to continue providing emergency repair services and routine maintenance
for occupied projects.



On December 6, 1993, a notice was published to delay the effective date of the final rule from December 6, 1993, until
February 4, 1994. This notice further delays the effective date of the final rule for an additional 60 days.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 4, 1993, at 58 FR 58784, the Department issued a final rule regarding required and permitted actions that
a PHA or IHA may take prior to approval of an application for demolition or disposition of a public or Indian Housing
project or a portion of a public or Indian housing project. The final rule had an effective date of December 6, 1993,
and a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64141) that delayed that effective date until February 4, 1994, because serious concerns
had been expressed about the impact of some of the provisions of the final rule on residents and resident organizations.




In the spirit of cooperation, the Department wishes to further delay the effective date of the final rule so that further
review of this rule may be conducted.

Accordingly, in FR Doc. 93-29687, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1993, at 58 FR 64141, the effective date for the referenced final rule regarding the Public and Indian
Housing Program is further delayed until April 5, 1994.

Special Local Regulations for Marine Events; Virginia Beach Offshore Grand Prix; Atlantic Ocean, Rudee Inlet, Lake
Rudee, Virginia Beach, VA


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Special Local Regulations are being adopted for the Virginia Beach Offshore Grand Prix held annually in the Atlantic
Ocean off Virginia Beach. The effect of these regulations will be to restrict general navigation in the regulated
area for the safety of spectators and participants. These regulations are needed to provide for the safety of life,
limb, and property on the navigable waters during the event.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning this regulation in the 

Federal Register

 on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47099). Interested persons were requested to submit comments. The 45-day comment period
ended on October 21, 1993. The Coast Guard received no letters.


Drafting Information


The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Fifth Coast Guard
District, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. 


Background and Purpose


The Virginia Beach Offshore Grand Prix, sponsored by the Eastern Virginia Offshore Racing Association is an annual
event held on the Atlantic Ocean off of Virginia Beach. As part of the application, the sponsor requested that the Coast
Guard provide control of spectator and commercial traffic within the regulated area. 


Discussion of Regulation 


The Eastern Virginia Offshore Racing Association annually sponsors the Virginia Beach Offshore Grand Prix. Since
this is a regular, yearly event, the Coast Guard is developing a special local regulation. Specifically the Coast
Guard will regulate the waterways surrounding the race course. The Virginia Beach Offshore Grand Prix race course
has been marked and checked by Waterway Surveys & Engineering, Ltd. to insure accurate certification of race
points and records. The course runs from Rudee Inlet at the southern end to approximately 75th Street at the northern
end. The Start/Finish line is at 20th Street. Race boats will be pitted in the Southside Marina and Owl's Creek area.
The course measures 11.0 Nautical miles (12.7 Statute miles). Waterway closures include the beach front and Rudee
Inlet at the start of and throughout the race. To provide for safety of participants, spectators, and vessels transiting
the area, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area during the race. 


Regulatory Evaluation 


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department
of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this
regulation is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. This regulation will only
be in effect for several hours, one day a year, and the impact on routine navigation is expected to be minimal.

Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small Entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). It is anticipated that the impact of this regulation on non-participating small entities
will actually benefit their business due to the increase in local tourism. The Coast Guard will certify under 5 U.S.C.
605(b), that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it is anticipated that this regulation will not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



This regulation has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket, and is available
for inspection or copying where indicated under

Temporary Speed Limits for the St. Marys River




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District is making a temporary amendment to the speed limits for the St. Marys
River during the 1993-94 icebreaking season. This amendment reduces the speed limit by 2 miles per hour through
that part of the system, between Munuscong Lake Lighted Buoy 8 and Lake Nicolet Light 80 upbound and between Lake Nicolet
Light 80 and Munuscong Lake Light 9 downbound. These temporary changes to the speed regulations are a precautionary
measure to minimize any possible damage to the environment due to movement of large commercial vessels through the
ice.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for making it effective less than 30 days after 

Federal Register 

publication. Publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking and delay in the effective date would be contrary to the
public interest because immediate action is necessary to prevent possible damage to the environment.



Discussion of Proposed Regulations



In a letter received on February 26, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources advised the Commander of the
Ninth Coast Guard District of concerns over the environmental impact of ship transits through the St. Marys River
during the period of March 21 to April 1. April 1 is the nominal date for the opening of the locks at Sault St. Marie, which
allows large commercial shipping access to the St Marys River from Lake Superior. In accordance with an agreement
reached on June 29, 1993 with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Michigan Department
of Natural Resources, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District is making this temporary change to the speed
regulations during periods when ice breaking is being conducted in the vicinity of Neebish Island, St. Mary's River,
Michigan, as a precautionary measure to minimize any possible damage to the environment. The speed limit is being
reduced by 2 statute miles per hour in the area between Munuscong Lake Lighted Buoy 8 and Lake Nicolet Light 80, upbound,
and between Lake Nicolet Lighted Buoy 80 and Munuscong Lake Light 9, downbound. The Light 9 checkpoint has been added
to extend the reduced speed limit area past Winter Point, thereby protecting the sensitive environment between Winter
Point and Light 9. Speed limits apply to the average speed between established reporting points.



Drafting Information



The drafter of this regulation is Captain Roderick A. Schultz, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Ninth Coast Guard District
Aids to Navigation Branch.



Federalism Implications



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



A recent environmental impact study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers indicated that March 21 is the optimal
opening date. [see U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Opening Operations of the
Lock Facilities on March 21 (February 1993), Supplement III to the Final Environmental Impact Statement, Operations,
Maintenance, and Minor Improvements of the Federal Facilities at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan (July 1977)]. The same
study by the Corps of Engineers indicates that there is no significant impact on fish populations due to movement of
large commercial vessels through the ice. However, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources asserts that there
may be such an impact during the early period of March 21 to April 1.


The Ninth Coast Guard District has adopted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers EIS, EIS Supplements, and EIS studies on
Operations, Maintenance, and Minor Improvements of the Federal Facilities at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. In addition,
the Coast Guard is preparing a supplement for the 1974 Ninth Coast Guard District EIS regarding icebreaking activity
on the Great Lakes.



Collection of Information



This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.



Economic and Regulatory Evaluation



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the
Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 CFR 11034, 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast
Guard has determined that a regulatory evaluation is unnecessary because of the minimal impact expected from this
regulation.

Safety Zone; Allegheny River




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Allegheny River. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic
in the regulated area due to hazards posed by severe icing along the entire length of this river. This regulation will
restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Drafting Information




The drafters of this regulation are Lt. John Meehan, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Regulatory History



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, extremely cold weather has blanketed the upper Ohio Valley
during the first two weeks of January, 1994. The Allegheny River, the northernmost navigable river in the valley's
watershed, has quickly frozen to ice thicknesses of up to one foot in several areas. Vessels attempting to transit
this river recently have reported problems in maintaining steerage and in making way on the river's ice clogged channels.
The severe icing of the Allegheny River and the subsequent navigation hazards posed by the ice developed rapidly and
were unexpected, leaving insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to
be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period, as immediate implementation
of navigation restrictions is needed to ensure the safety of vessels transitting the area.

Background and Purpose 
 


The upper Ohio River Valley is experiencing one of the coldest winters on record. Unusually high precipitation levels
and record low temperatures have led to significant ice accumulations along the region's navigable waterways. The
icing problem is especially severe along the Allegheny River, where ice thicknesses of up to one foot have been reported.
Vessels attempting to transit the Allegheny River have experienced difficulty in maintaining steerage and in making
way on this river's ice clogged channels. By January 17, 1994, the Allegheny River's navigability had deteriorated
(due to ice) to the point where several vessel operators elected not to move tank barge cargoes on this river. Since
temperatures in this region are not expected to moderate in the short term, Captain of the Port Pittsburgh is establishing
a safety zone on the Allegheny river to protect vessels from the risks posed by the river's ice clogged channels. Commencing
at 4 p.m. on January 18, 1994, vessel traffic will not be permitted to transit any navigable portion of the Allegheny
River unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh. Vessels intending to transit the Allegheny
River may request Captain of the Port authorization to proceed by calling Marine Safety Office Pittsburgh at (412)
644-5808 or Coast Guard Ohio Valley via VHF marine band radio Channel 13 (156.650 MHz) at least 24 hours prior
to the vessel's scheduled arrival time at Allegheny River mile 0.0. The Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will authorize
Allegheny River transits on a case-by-case basis after considering the vessel's size (horsepower), tow composition,
and destination on the river. This safety zone will remain in effect until 4 p.m. on February 15, 1994, unless terminated
at an earlier date by the Captain of the Port, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
 


Regulatory Evaluation 
 


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements.
A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal
due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions and the relative infrequency of commercial vessel
transits along this navigable waterway. 
 


Federalism Assessment 
 


Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
 


Environmental Assessment 
 


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
as an action required to protect public safety.

Increasing the Amounts of the Rewards and Adding Money Laundering to the List of Offenses for Which Rewards May Be Paid
for Information



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Postal Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In 1993, the Postal Service revised its reward policy by increasing the reward amounts and by adding money laundering
to the list of offenses for which rewards may be paid for information and services leading to the arrest and conviction
of persons committing postal crimes. Consequently, this rule amends the regulations to reflect the revised reward
policy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Postal Service offers rewards for information and services leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators
of the following crimes: (1) Murder or manslaughter of a postal employee; (2) assault on a postal employee; (3) robbery
or attempted robbery of any custodian of postal money or property; (4) burglary of a post office; (5) theft, possession,
destruction, or obstruction of mail; (6) postage or meter tampering; (7) offenses involving money orders; (8) mailing
bombs or explosives; (9) mailing poisons, controlled substances, or hazardous materials; (10) using the mails for
child pornography; and (11) using the mails for money laundering.



Postal Service regulations concerning these rewards are published in title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) as a note following  233.2(b). Since the Postal Service has decided to increase the amounts of the rewards,
it is necessary to amend the CFR to reflect the revised Postal Service policy. In addition, the offense of money laundering
(i.e., mailing or causing to be mailed any money which has been obtained illegally), has been added to the reward list.

In summary,  233.2 is amended by: (1) Revising paragraph (b) to substitute ``Poster 296'' for ``Notice 96'';
(2) adding paragraph (b)(1)(x) to add money laundering to the list of offenses; and (3) revising the note following
paragraph (b)(2) to increase the reward amounts.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Commonwealth of Virginia-Small Business
Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).






</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose
of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program.
This SIP revision was submitted by the Commonwealth to satisfy the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure
that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with
the CAA. The rationale for approving is set forth in this document; additional information is available at the address
indicated. This action is being taken in accordance with the provisions of the CAA.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background
 


Implementation of the provisions of the CAA will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain
and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses
frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine
the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses,
the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs
EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements
for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 

On November 10, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists
of a plan for establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program. In order to gain full approval, the Commonwealth's submittal must provide for each of the following program
elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance
assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests
of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine
and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business
stationary sources for assistance in the PROGRAM. The plan includes the duties, funding, and schedule of implementation
for the three PROGRAM components.

Under sections 10.1-1323 through 10.1-1326 of the Code of Virginia, the Department of Air Pollution Control,
now the Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ), is authorized to create and administer the Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. This law authorizes VA DEQ to create and administer
the SBAP. This law also creates an Office of Small Business Ombudsman and a Small Business Environmental Compliance
Advisory Board, and defines source eligibility for the SBAP.



II. Evaluation of SIP Revision 



Section 507(a) of the CAA sets forth seven requirements that the Commonwealth must meet to have an approvable SBAP.
Four of these requirements are discussed in the first section and the requirement for the establishment of an Ombudsman
in the second section. Discussion of the remaining two requirements follows the third section. 
 


1. Small Business Assistance Program



The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the CAA. The second requirement
is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention
and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies,
process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.

Virginia has met these first two requirements by establishing a SBAP, located in the VA DEQ Office of Permit Assistance,
with the responsibility of serving as a clearinghouse for information related to compliance methods and control
technologies, pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection. The Virginia SBAP will disseminate
information on compliance which is easily understandable to a nontechnical audience as well as handle inquiries
on specific methods for achieving compliance with state and Federal regulations. 

The information dissemination will be both proactive and reactive. VA DEQ Air Division has presented a series of seminars
throughout Virginia to explain applicable requirements to small businesses and interested citizens. Another series
of seminars is being planned, with the assistance of Virginia's Department of Economic Development. The VA DEQ Air
Division will also receive seminar assistance from the Waste Management Division and the Emergency Services Division
for pollution prevention and accidental release prevention, respectively. The SBAP manager and staff members will
develop public service announcements (PSAs) and information packages of print material, addressing all topics
germane to the SBAP, including compliance, pollution prevention, accidental release prevention, legal rights
under the CAA, permitting assistance, notification of rights, audits, and source modification. The PSAs and mailings
of print material will begin in November, 1994. For the reactive component of the SBAP, a toll-free number will be installed
by October, 1994. Through outreach techniques, the SBAP staff will inform small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the CAA. 
The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
CAA in a timely and efficient manner, and the fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small
business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably
adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation
or standards issued under the CAA. Virginia has met these requirements through the SBAP. The staff of the SBAP will
compile a list of technical referrals who will assist them in responding to specific inquiries. The VA DEQ's Air Division,
Office of Compliance and Enforcement (OCE) and regional offices currently offer compliance assistance to sources
in determining applicable requirements of the CAA. The OCE will serve as technical experts available for referral
by the SBAP in identifying applicable rules, determining necessity of a permit, and identifying alternatives for
achieving compliance with state and local regulations.
 


2. Ombudsman Office 



Section 507(a)(3) of the CAA requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business
stationary sources. The Code of Virginia, section 10.1-1324 authorizes the creation of the Ombudsman's office.
In VA DEQ, the Director of the Office of Permit Assistance serves as Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is appointed by the DEQ's
Director and reports directly to him or her, and the SBAP manager reports to the Ombudsman. Additionally, each of Virginia's
seven air quality control regional offices will have an appointed liaison.



3. Compliance Advisory Board



Section 507(e) of the CAA requires the state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members
selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected
by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head
of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. Virginia has established a Compliance Advisory Board
pursuant to the Code of Virginia, section 10.1-1325. It is comprised of seven members who are appointed for four-year
terms, starting on July 31, 1993. The makeup of the board is prescribed as is required by section 507(e). Members of
the board will serve without pay, and administrative support for the Board will be funded through the ombudsman's
office. 
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(A) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (B) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources
is easily understandable; (C) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP;
and (D) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP
to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to
comply with them, EPA believes that the state program must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering
to the general principles of these Federal statutes.) The duties and responsibilities of Virginia's Compliance
Advisory Board under section 10.1-1326 of the Code of Virginia indicate that it will be responsible for all four
of the activities listed above.

The sixth requirement of CAA section 507(a) is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary
sources of their obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors
or, at the option of the Commonwealth, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance
with the Act. Virginia's Ombudsman and Compliance Advisory Board will develop procedures for referring sources
to qualified auditors. The procedures will determine how auditors will qualify, what the cost will be, the format
and content of the audit report, and Virginia's actions in the event of a violation discovered during an audit. The
audit procedures will be completed by July 31, 1994.

The seventh requirement of CAA section 507(a) is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small
business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or
(B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practices or compliance methods. Virginia has committed
to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a source for modification of work practices. The source
modification procedures will be completed by July 31, 1994.




4. Source Eligibility



Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 




Code of Virginia section 10.1-1323 duplicates the language of CAA section 507(c)(1) in defining eligible stationary
sources. It also provides for the State Air Pollution Control Board to hear petitions for eligibility and eligibility
exclusions. The Board will consult with both EPA and the Small Business Administration regarding exclusions. The
Ombudsman and Compliance Advisory Board will be responsible for developing eligibility determination procedures.



III. Summary of SIP Revision 


The Commonwealth of Virginia has submitted a SIP revision providing for each of the program elements required by CAA
section 507. As previously stated, the authority to implement the SBAP has been delegated to the Department of Environmental
Quality. Program implementation will begin no later than November 15, 1994. The Director of the Department of Environmental
Quality will appoint the Ombudsman and hire the three staff dedicated to implementing the program at the beginning
of the Commonwealth's 1993-1994 fiscal year. The Code of Virginia, section 10.1-1325 authorizes the
creation of a Compliance Advisory Board to periodically review the effectiveness of the SBAP. All members will be
appointed for four year terms, starting no later than July 31, 1993. In this action, EPA is approving the SIP revision
submittal by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Accordingly,  52.2460 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart VV-Virginia
to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part of the Virginia SIP.

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective April 5, 1994, unless, by March 7, 1994, notice
is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn
before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final
action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period.
If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on April 5, 1994.



Final Action


EPA is approving Virginia's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program. Accordingly, 40 CFR 52.2460 is added to reflect EPA's approval action. The Agency
has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved state implementation plan for conformance with
the Clean Air Act, including sections 507 and section 110(a)(2)(E). 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C.
603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

In this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

This action to approve the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance
Assistance Program in Virginia has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator
under the procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225) as revised by an October 4, 1993 Memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866,
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.


Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve the establishment of a
Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program in Virginia must be
filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review
nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Alabama: Approval of Revisions to Alabama State Regulations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the particulate emission regulations of the Alabama State Implementation Plan (SIP)
submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management on September 23, 1985.
The revisions include specific regulations for coke ovens for Gulf States Steel Corporation, formerly Gadsden Steel
Company, formerly Republic Steel Corporation. These regulations were revised to ensure that the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter will continue to be maintained in Etowah County, Alabama.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 23, 1985, the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management submitted
revisions to the Alabama SIP to address air emissions from steel mills located in Etowah County. The air quality with
regard to particulate matter in Etowah County, Alabama, is predominantly influenced by the operation of Gulf States
Steel Corporation. Therefore, mitigation measures concentrate on those processes peculiar to the making of steel.
The following is a detailed summary of the revisions to the Alabama SIP which EPA is approving in this action. 





The State's original implementation plan for the control of particulate emissions from steel mills contained two
broadly applicable regulations. Visible emissions were regulated by section 335-3-4-.01 (formerly
4.1) and the amount of particulate mass emitted was regulated by the general process weight provisions of section
335-3-4-.04 (formerly 4.4). In general, those regulations adequately addressed particulate emissions
from stacks, but could not be effectively applied to control process fugitive emissions. These regulations were
difficult to enforce because there was no easy or accurate way to measure actual emissions. 


In order to remedy the problems associated with these original regulations, the State adopted source-specific regulations
governing the distinctive emission processes associated with coke making. The coke oven regulations were adopted
by the Alabama Air Pollution Control Commission on June 12, 1974. The regulations were submitted to EPA for approval
as a revision to the Alabama SIP on June 20, 1974. EPA approved the regulations on August 28, 1975 (40 FR 39503). A summary
of these coke oven emission regulations is provided in this notice in order to provide an understanding of the control
strategy pertinent to this notice. Many of these regulations remain an integral part of the strategy. The regulations
were originally codified under section 4.9 but have been recodified as follows. 




Section 335-3-4-.09(2)

_This section requires that all reasonable measures be applied to prevent emissions from the unloading and transfer
of coal and coke.

Section 335-3-4-.09(3), Charging_

This section limits charging emissions to less than 20 percent except for 3 minutes in any hour for batteries with less
than 70 ovens. 




Section 335-3-4-.09(4), Pushing_

This section forbids any visible emissions greater that 40 percent during the pushing cycle except for one push per
hour (EPA approved this regulation April 4, 1979 (44 FR 20079)). 



Section 335-3-4-.09(5)

_This section limits visible emissions to 10 percent at the offtake piping and no more than 5 percent at the charging
lids. 




Section 335-3-4-.09(6), Coke Oven Doors_

This section provides that there shall be no visible emissions from more than 15 percent of the doors of the battery.





Section 335-3-4-.09(7)_

This section describes the general maintenance requirements for coke ovens. 




Section 335-3-4-.09(8), Combustion Stacks_

This section provides that there shall be no visible emissions of an opacity greater than 20 percent from any stack
except for 3 minutes in any consecutive 60 minutes. 




Section 335-3-4-.09(9), Quenching_

This section requires that quench towers be provided with properly operating baffles and provides for water quality
guidelines. 


EPA's analysis of emission reductions needed to achieve attainment of the particulate matter NAAQS resulted in a
finding that the proposed pushing regulation (335-3-4-.09(4)) was inadequate. EPA, therefore,
took no official action on that regulation on August 28, 1975, when the other regulations were approved, pending the
conclusion of additional studies. Consequently, the State's process weight and general opacity regulations remained
the only federally approved regulation for coke oven pushing emissions. On April 4, 1979, EPA approved coke oven plan
revisions submitted on July 14, 1978, to attain the national standards for particulate matter. These regulations
were later relaxed to the 1975 version. 


Neither of the two regulatory approaches heretofore described contained specific regulations to limit fugitive
particulate emissions from road dust, parking lots, storage piles, etc. However, these nontraditional fugitive
emissions are now subject to limitations by permit condition and by the terms of today's final rule. 


On March 3, 1978, in accordance with section 107(d) of the CAA, EPA designated the area surrounding the Gulf States
Steel Corporation facility in Etowah County, Alabama, as nonattainment for total suspended particulates (TSP).
Gulf States Steel Corporation remained the dominant major point source contributing to the particulate nonattainment
problem in Etowah County. 

Section 172 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires that plan revisions assuring the attainment of the NAAQS for particulate
matter are to provide for the implementation of reasonably available control technology (RACT) as expeditiously
as practicable. In response to the section 107(d) nonattainment designation and call for a particulate SIP revision
for Etowah and Jefferson Counties, Alabama revised its coke oven pushing and charging regulations to require a RACT
level of control. These regulations were directed specifically to Jefferson and Etowah Counties and were federally
approved on April 4, 1979. These regulations, however, were never implemented due to legal challenges to the section
107 redesignation process. On procedural grounds, Republic Steel and U.S. Steel challenged the validity of EPA's
March 3, 1978, designation of portions of Jefferson and Etowah Counties as nonattainment areas for TSP. 


On May 3, 1979, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals (now the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals) in 

Republic Steel vs. EPA 

and 

U.S. Steel vs. EPA 

found that EPA had not adequately complied with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in its nonattainment
designation action, and directed EPA to initiate the designation process again. On June 10, 1980, EPA again designated
Etowah County as primary nonattainment for TSP and directed the State to submit a SIP revision. U.S. Steel and Republic
Steel did not appeal this designation of nonattainment by EPA.

In an order issued July 2, 1979, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the effective date of EPA's approval of
the 1978 coke pushing and charging regulations until the nonattainment designation challenge was resolved. In a
second order issued October 23, 1979, further proceedings in the case were stayed pending EPA's final action on any
new SIP revision that might be required after finalization of the nonattainment boundaries in Etowah and Jefferson
Counties. As part of the basis of the second stay, EPA agreed not to enforce the 1978 coke pushing regulations pending
finalization of the nonattainment boundaries and EPA's final action on any new SIP revision that may be required.
Thus, neither EPA nor the State enforced the 1978 coke oven pushing and charging regulations. 

In November 1984, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals notified the Department of Justice and counsel for U.S. Steel
and Gadsden Steel that the Court would not carry this case on its docket indefinitely and directed counsel to confer
and dispose of the case. U.S. Steel and Gadsden Steel Company (formerly Republic Steel) requested that EPA's action
in adopting 1978 coke oven regulations be vacated or, alternatively, that the July 1979 stay of enforcement of these
regulations be continued. EPA and the Justice Department disagreed with the two steel companies, pointing out that
the petition for review lacked ``good cause'' in light of EPA's second (and unchallenged) designation of parts of
Jefferson and Etowah Counties as nonattainment areas for total suspended particulate matter (TSP). EPA and the Justice
Department reasoned that the 1978 Alabama-submitted coke oven regulations (which represented Reasonably Available
Control Technology) were needed due to the affected area's nonattainment status. The parties failed to reach an agreement
and filed legal briefs and memoranda with the court. 

On May 14, 1985, the Eleventh Circuit Court dismissed the steel companies' petitions for review without prejudice.
The dismissal of the case dissolved the July 1979 agreement by EPA to stay enforcement of the 1978 Alabama coke oven
regulations. However, because of the imminent approval status of this SIP revision, EPA has continued to refrain
from enforcement of the 1978 regulations. Regulations in this SIP revision will supersede the 1978 coke oven regulations
in Etowah County. 

A reduction in particulate emission levels has occurred at the Gulf States Steel facility due to the enforcement of
regulations applying to steel mills adopted in 1974, along with a fugitive emissions control program more recently
implemented by Gulf States Steel Corporation. To insure that the reductions associated with the fugitive emissions
control program will continue in the future, ADEM adopted regulations requiring Gulf States Steel Corporation to
continue efforts to reduce fugitive emissions.

ADEM submitted SIP revisions on June 19, 1985, September 3, 1985, and September 15, 1985, modifying the particulate
control strategy for Etowah County. The State requested that Etowah County be redesignated to attainment for TSP.
EPA has more recently adopted a particulate matter standard based on particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less
than 10 microns (PM10). Under the 1990 Amendments, Etowah County does not have to redesignate to attainment for TSP,
and therefore, the EPA is not acting on the request to redesignate. 

The following is a list of the revisions made to Chapter 4 to control particulate emissions. These revisions are being
approved in today's action. 


335-3-4-.17(1) 

Visible Emissions from roof monitors or other openings in the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) building, other than water
mist or vapor, shall not exceed a shade or density greater than twenty percent (20%) opacity as determined on a three
(3) minute rolling average. Compliance shall be determined by using the procedures specified at 40 CFR part 60, appendix
A, Method 9 excluding section 2.5. 



335-3-4-.17(2) 

All paved roads shall be vacuum swept or flushed of surface material every third consecutive day. The vacuum 
sweeper shall have a minimum blower capacity of 12,000 cfm and the flushing machine shall dispense water at the rate
of 0.32 gal/yd.2 



335-3-4-.17(3) 

Paved parking areas shall be vacuum swept or flushed of surface material every calendar quarter. The vacuum sweeper
shall have a minimum blower capacity of 12,000 cfm and the flushing machine shall dispense water at the rate of 0.32
gal/yd.2



335-3-4-.17(4) 

Paved road or area flushing specified in sections 335-3-4-.17(2) and 335-3-4-.17(3)
is not required when the temperature is below 32 
 F. Paved road or area cleaning is not required when precipitation during the previous 24-hour period has exceeded
0.01 inches. 



335-3-4-.17(5) 

Unpaved roads, traffic areas in the slag storage area, and traffic areas in other material storage areas shall be treated
with petroleum resin, asphalt emulsion, or equivalent dust suppressant on a quarterly or more frequent basis as determined
by the Director. 



335-3-4-.17(6) 

Unpaved parking lots shall be treated with petroleum, resin, asphalt emulsion, or equivalent dust suppressant on
a semi-annual basis.

335-3-4-.17(7) 

The petroleum resin or asphalt emulsion dust suppressant required in sections 335-3-4-.17(5)
and 335-3-4-.17(6) shall be applied at a dilution ratio of 20% for the initial three applications
and 12% for subsequent applications. The suppressant shall be applied at the rate of 0.75 gal/yd2 of diluted solution.
Other dust suppressants must be applied at an equivalent dilution ratio and application rate as determined by the
Director. 


335-3-4-.17(8) 

The source shall maintain at its plant premises, and make available for inspection, records documenting each occasion
on which paved areas are cleaned in accordance with sections 335-3-4-.17(2) and 335-3-4-.17(3),
and any occasion on which such paved areas are not cleaned according to the required schedule, including any justification
for failure to meet the required schedule, such as equipment breakdown or inclement weather conditions. The company
shall also maintain, and make available for inspection, records documenting the frequency and amount of applications
required by sections 335-3-4-.17(5) and 335-3-4-.17(6). These records shall
be maintained for a minimum of two years following the date of the recorded information. 


335-3-4-.17(9) 

The source shall, within 30 days of approval of this section, notify the Department of a designated reclaim area on
the plant property and a designated paved road at its premises to be used to transport molten slag from the basic oxygen
furnace shop to the reclaim area. These designations shall not be changed without the written approval of the Director.

These regulations have resulted in an estimated particulate emission reduction of 1400 tons/year and have allowed
Etowah County to demonstrate measured attainment of the NAAQS for PM10. EPA has concluded that the revisions are sufficient
to allow the area to continue to attain and maintain the NAAQS for PM10. The approval of these regulations is accompanied
by the 

caveat

 that the levels of control specified for blast furnace casthouses and coke batteries do not, in the Agency's opinion,
represent RACT and would not necessarily be sufficient for nonattainment areas to achieve compliance with the NAAQS.
It should be noted that there are no sources affected by this action which receive stack height credits above Good Engineering
Practice (GEP) or any other dispersion technique. 


Final Action


EPA is approving the aforementioned revisions to the Alabama SIP. These revisions are consistent with EPA policy
and guidance. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA
anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective April
5, 1994. However, if notice is received by March 7, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments,
this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One notice will
withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing
a comment period. 
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those
requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)

This action has been classified as a table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived tables
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted
a request for a permanent waiver for table 2 and table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604) Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval of Maintenance Plan and Designation 
of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; OH


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is approving a redesignation request and maintenance plan for Cuyahoga County, Ohio as a revision to Ohio's
State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide. 


The revision is based on a request from the State of Ohio to redesignate this area, and approve its maintenance plan,
and on the supporting data the State submitted. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient
data are available to warrant such change. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 107(d) of the pre-amended Clean Air Act (CAA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
promulgated the carbon monoxide (CO) attainment status for each area of every State. For Ohio, Cuyahoga County was
designated as a nonattainment area for CO, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). On November
15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. Pursuant to section 107(d)(1)(C) of the CAA, Cuyahoga County retained its designation
of nonattainment for CO by operation of law, see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). At the same time the area was classified
as a moderate CO nonattainment area based on a design value of 10.1 parts per million. 


The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency requested that Cuyahoga County be redesignated to attainment in a letter
dated October 16, 1992, and received by USEPA on October 21, 1992. On July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37453) USEPA proposed to approve
Ohio's requested redesignation. The CO nonattainment area at issue consists of Cuyahoga County. The State of Ohio
has met all of the CAA requirements for redesignation pursuant to section 107(d)(3)(E). 
The State provided monitoring, modeling and emissions data to support its redesignation request. The 1992 CO attainment
emissions inventory totals in tons per day are 98.55, 81.25, and 67.17, respectively, for the point, area, and mobile
sources. The State relied on the existence of an approved Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program as part of its maintenance
demonstration. 
The State of Ohio also provided the following schedule for implementing the contingency plan and committed to retain
the existing monitoring network for carbon monoxide in the Cleveland area. The last column in the schedule is the amount
of time that a specific activity must start ahead of the oxygenated fuels program start date for scheduling purposes.
The completion time is the amount of time required to finish a specific activity in the table.

Public Comment/USEPA Response 



The following comments were received on the July 12, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking. USEPA's response follows
each comment.

Comment: 

The air quality in the Cleveland area is unhealthy and the area should remain nonattainment and the requirements not
be relaxed. If nothing is done now, the problem will get worse. 



Response: 

The State of Ohio submitted air quality modeling and monitoring data as a part of their redesignation request. These
data show that the area is currently in attainment of the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
carbon monoxide (CO) and is expected to remain in attainment for at least the next 10 years. The primary NAAQS are established
to protect public health. Since, the State has met the redesignation requirement to demonstrate that the air quality
meets the NAAQS, USEPA believes the air quality is sufficient to protect the public health. USEPA cannot reject the
redesignation request on this basis. 



Comment: 

If the redesignation is approved, it would discourage the public transportation system in the area from making improvements
to its fleet. 



Response: 

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) has provisions for Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality Improvement Programs. Under these provisions, funding has been made available for ozone and CO nonattainment
areas for certain actions that can improve air quality. Since the air quality in Cuyahoga County remains nonattainment
for ozone, they can apply for these funds. 



Comment: 

Oxygenated gasoline creates less pollution and should be mandated in the area. 



Response

: While oxygenated fuel lowers CO levels, the State has shown that the CO levels are below the standard and are expected
to remain below the standard for at least the next 10 years in the County, without using oxygenated fuels. Since the
State has demonstrated maintenance without the measure and an oxygenated fuels program is not an applicable requirement
for purposes of redesignation, EPA cannot mandate the program in this area. However, if a violation were to occur the
State has committed to implement oxygenated fuels in the area. 



Comment: 

The area should not be redesignated because it would then be required to use reformulated gasoline during the winter.




Response: 

Reformulated fuels are required in certain ozone nonattainment areas, and oxygenated fuels are required in certain
CO nonattainment areas. These are two distinct requirements. The redesignation of the area to attainment for CO will
not result in the county having a reformulated fuels requirement for controlling CO. Furthermore, under the CAA none
of the areas in Ohio are currently subject to the reformulated fuels requirement. 

The remaining public comments received (over 120) were all in support of the redesignation and, therefore, will not
be addressed here. 



Rulemaking Action 



The amended Clean Air Act established new submittal requirements with respect to various programs. Therefore, USEPA
reviewed the State's submittal, to determine whether the State met the applicable requirements of the amended Act.


Section 187(a)(4) of the Act establishes the I/M requirements applicable to moderate CO nonattainment areas. Section
187(a)(4) requires the State to have submitted an I/M program immediately upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. USEPA has interpreted this provision to require submittal of a commitment to USEPA by November 15, 1992, see
57 FR 52950 (Nov. 5, 1992). This commitment would commit to the submittal of an actual program by November 15, 1993.
Therefore, November 15, 1992, is the date on which the I/M requirement became applicable. Although Ohio is not required
to submit an  approvable I/M program in order for USEPA to determine that the State has met the applicable requirements
of part D, the State must have an approved I/M program prior to redesignation because it has relied on such a program
to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS. 

The redesignation request can now be approved as meeting conditions of the CAA in section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation,
since: (1) The I/M regulations have recently been fully approved as a part of the CO SIP; (2) the State has submitted
a schedule for implementing the contingency plan; and (3) the State has committed to maintain an acceptable CO monitoring
network in the maintenance area. The State has also met the terms of the May 26, 1988, SIP call for the Cleveland area.

<PARENT> FR940204-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The applicable New Source Review (NSR) requirements for moderate CO areas are in section 172(c)(5) of the Act. Section
172(b) establishes a date no later than November 15, 1993, for submittal of the section 172(c) requirements. Since
USEPA has not established an earlier date for submittal, the NSR requirement does not become an applicable requirement
until November 15, 1993. Since Ohio submitted the redesignation request for Cuyahoga County prior to November 15,
1993, and the area is now designated attainment, there is no longer a requirement for nonattainment area CO NSR. 

The amended Act also specifies new requirements_i.e., requirements not established under the pre-amended Act_for
CO nonattainment areas. These include an oxygenated fuels program and an emissions inventory. These requirements
were due on November 15, 1992. Since Ohio submitted the redesignation request prior to November 15, 1992, the State
was not required to submit these plan elements for purposes of redesignation. Further, since the area is now designated
attainment for CO, the CO emissions inventory and oxygenated fuels SIPs are no longer required. However, a CO emissions
inventory was submitted as the attainment emissions inventory and is being approved as part of this redesignation
action. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Today's action makes final the action proposed on July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37453) to approve Ohio's requested redesignation
of Cuyahoga County to attainment for CO. This action has been reclassified from a Table 1 to a Table 2 action by the Regional
Administrator under the processing procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Tables 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a 
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements
on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any
regulatory requirements on sources. I certify that the approval of the redesignation request will not affect a substantial
number of small entities. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review may be
filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings
to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On January 6, 1994, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment
Standards Administration of the Department of Labor published final regulations governing the filing and enforcement
of attestations by health care facilities seeking to use the services of nonimmigrant aliens as registered nurses
under H-1A visas. At that time, ETA submitted the information collection requirements to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This document amends the January 6, 1994, 

Federal Register

 document to display the OMB control numbers and announces the effective date for the sections containing information
collection requirements for which OMB approval has been received.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Paperwork Reduction Act's (PRA) provisions on information collection are triggered when a health care facility
(facility) files an attestation with the Department of Labor (DOL or Department), as a condition for being able to
use the services of a nonimmigrant registered nurse entering the United States on an H-1A visa. The attestation
is a prerequisite to filing a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for H-1A nurses.
Facilities are required to file attestations with DOL attesting to certain conditions and to steps taken to recruit
and retain U.S. nurses in order to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant alien nurses.



The attestations, required under sections 101(a)(15)(h)(i)(a) and 212(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
pertain to substantial disruption in the delivery of health care services, absence of adverse effect on wages and
working conditions of similarly employed registered nurses, payment of wages to nonimmigrant nurses employed by
the facility at wage rates paid to other registered nurses similarly employed by the facility, taking timely and significant
steps designed to recruit and retain U.S. nurses to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant nurses, absence of a strike
or lockout, and giving appropriate notice of filing. Attestation is made on Form ETA 9029, a copy of which is published
as an appendix to this document, but which will not be published in the CFR.

The attestation process is administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of DOL, while complaints
and investigations regarding the attestations are handled by the Wage and Hour Division of DOL's Employment Standards
Administration (ESA).

Public reporting burden for collection of information the first year a facility submits an attestation is estimated
to average 8 to 10 hours for searching existing information/data sources and gathering and compiling the data at the
facility the first year that a facility submits an attestation. In the second and subsequent years, the reporting
burden, based on operating experience, is expected to average about 3 hours.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviewed the collection of information requirements for facilities filing
attestations as a condition to petition the INS for H-1A nurses in accordance with the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.,

 and 5 CFR part 1320. OMB approved all information requirements contained in 20 CFR part 655, subpart D, and 29 CFR part
504, subpart D, under OMB clearance number 1205-0305.

On January 31, 1994, OMB approved the information collection provisions until September 1995.

ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the provisions of the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the tidewater goby (

Eucyclogobius newberryi

). The tidewater goby is a fish that occurs in tidal streams associated with coastal wetlands in California. Since
1900, the tidewater goby has disappeared from nearly 50 percent of the coastal lagoons within its historic range,
including 74 percent of the lagoons south of Morro Bay in central California. Only three populations currently exist
south of Ventura County. This rule implements the protection and recovery provisions provided by the Act for the tidewater
goby. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The tidewater goby (

Eucyclogobius newberryi

) is a small fish, 
rarely exceeding 50 millimeters (2 inches) standard length, and is 
characterized by large pectoral fins and a ventral sucker-like disk 
formed by the complete fusion of the pelvic fins. The tidewater goby 
was first described as a new species (

Gobius newberryi

) by Girard 
(1856), from specimens collected in the San Francisco Bay area. Based 
on Girard's specimens, Gill (1862) reassigned 

Gobius newberryi

 to the 
newly described genus 

Eucyclogobius

 (Eschmeyer 1990). 
A member of the family Gobiidae, the tidewater goby is the only 
species in the genus 

Eucyclogobius 

and is almost unique among fishes 
along the Pacific coast of the United States in its restriction to 
waters with low salinities in California's coastal wetlands. All life 
stages of tidewater gobies are found at the upper end of lagoons in 
salinities less than 10 parts per thousand (ppt); however, gobies from 
two populations have been collected and reared in slightly higher 
salinities (Ramona Swenson, University of California, Berkeley, 

in litt. 

1993). Although its closest relatives are marine species, the tidewater 
goby does not have a marine life history phase. This lack of a marine 
phase severely restricts the frequency of genetic exchange between 
coastal lagoon populations and significantly lowers the potential for 
natural recolonization of a locality once extirpated. Studies by 
Crabtree (1985) noted that some populations of gobies have 
differentiated genetically, indicating a long period of isolation. 
Tidewater gobies have a short lifespan and seem to be an annual species 
(Irwin and Stoltz 1984, Swift 1990), further restricting their potential 
to recolonize habitats from which they have been extirpated.

The tidewater goby occurs in loose aggregations of a few to several 
hundred individuals on the substrate in shallow water less than 1 meter 
(3 feet) deep (Swift 

et al. 

1989), although gobies have been observed at 
depths of 1.5 to 2.3 meters (4.9 to 7.6 feet) (Dan Holland, University 
of Southwestern Louisiana, 

in litt. 

1993). Peak nesting activities 
commence in late April through early May, when male gobies dig a 
vertical nesting burrow 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) deep in 
clean, coarse sand. Suitable water temperatures for nesting are 18 to 
22
 C (75.6 to 79.6
 F) with salinities of 5 to 10 ppt. Male gobies 
remain in the burrows to guard eggs, which are hung from the ceiling and 
walls of the burrow until hatching. Larval gobies are found midwater 
around vegetation until they become benthic (Swift 

et al. 

1989). 
Although the potential for year round spawning exists, it is probably 
unlikely because of seasonal low temperatures and disruptions of lagoons 
during winter storms. Ecological studies performed at two sites 
documented spawning occurring as early as the first week in January 
(Swenson 

in litt. 

1993). Although usually associated with lagoons, the 
tidewater goby has been documented in ponded freshwater habitats as far 
as 8 kilometers (5 miles) upstream from San Antonio lagoon in Santa 
Barbara County (Irwin and Stoltz 1984). 

The tidewater goby is discontinuously distributed throughout 
California, ranging from Tillas Slough (mouth of the Smith River) in Del 
Norte County south to Agua Hedionda Lagoon in San Diego County. Areas 
of precipitous coastlines that preclude the formation of lagoons at 
stream mouths have created three natural gaps in the distribution of the 
goby. Gobies are apparently absent from three sections of the coast 
between: (1) Humboldt Bay and Ten Mile River, (2) Point Arena and Salmon 
Creek, and (3) Monterey Bay and Arroyo del Oso. 

Roughly 10 percent of the coastal lagoons presently containing 
populations of tidewater goby are under Federal ownership. Over 40 
percent of the remaining populations are either entirely or partly owned 
and managed by the State of California. The remainder are privately 
owned. 



Previous Federal Action 



The tidewater goby was first classified by the Service as a 
category 2 species in 1982 (47 FR 58454). It was reclassified as a 
category 1 candidate in 1991 (56 FR 58804) based on status and threat 
information in Swift 

et al. 

(1989). Category 2 applies to taxa for 
which information now in the possession of the Service indicates that 
proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, 
but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats 
are not currently available to support a listing proposal. Category 1 
applies to taxa for which the Service has on file substantial 
information on biological vulnerability and threats to support proposals 
to list them as endangered or threatened species. 

On October 24, 1990, the Service received a petition from Dr. Camm 
Swift, Associate Curator of Fishes at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural 
History, to list the tidewater goby as endangered (Swift 1990). The 
petition, status surveys, and accompanying data describe the goby as 
threatened because of past and continuing losses of coastal and riparian 
habitats within its historic range. The Service's finding that this 
petition presented substantial information that the requested action may 
be warranted was published on March 22, 1991 (56 FR 12146). Following 
this finding, the Service initiated a status review on the tidewater 
goby. 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act), as amended 
in 1982, requires the Secretary to make a finding within 12 months of 
the date a petition is received as to whether or not the requested 
action is warranted. On December 11, 1992, the Service published a 
proposal to list the tidewater goby as an endangered species (57 FR 
58770). The proposed rule constituted the 12-month finding that the 
petitioned action was warranted.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the December 11, 1992 proposed rule, all interested parties were 
requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute 
to the development of a final determination. Appropriate Federal and 
State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and other 
interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper 
notices were published in The Los Angeles Times on January 1, 1993, The 
San Francisco Sunday Examiner and Chronicle on January 3, 1993, and The 
San Diego Union-Tribune on February 4, 1993. The public comment period 
ended on February 9, 1993. A total of 548 comments were received. The 
Service received one letter from a Federal agency, three letters from 
State offices, and five from city or county agencies. Five hundred and 
ten of the comments were post cards from individuals urging support for 
the listing of the species. The Service received 29 letters from 
individuals and private organizations. Of those, only one expressed an 
opinion in opposition to listing the tidewater goby as endangered. 
The National Park Service (Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area) stated support for the listing of the tidewater goby as 
endangered and suggested locations within the recreation area boundaries 
that may be candidates for reintroduction of the species. The National 
Park Service also sought assistance from the Service in determining 
potential habitat locations on lands not under public ownership that may 
be acquired under its land acquisition program. 
Three California State agencies offered comments. The Topanga-Las 
Virgenes Resource Conservation District, a subdivision of State 
government, expressed full support for the listing of the goby. The 
California Coastal Commission stated, ``The acute vulnerability of the 
tidewater goby to man-induced changes of estuarine habitat makes the 
development of comprehensive management strategies and plans, including 
development of recovery plans, for this species imperative.'' The 
California Department of Fish and Game submitted information pertaining 
to a project to reestablish a population of tidewater gobies on Waddell 
Creek Lagoon. The population was reintroduced in the fall of 1991 and 
subsequently sampled in November 1992. Gobies were reported from three 
sites in the lagoon. The Department will continue to obtain information 
on that population as it is surveyed. 
Five letters of information were received from city or county 
agencies. Two of these, one from the County of Santa Barbara Resource 
Management Department and one from the City of Santa Cruz, detailed 
population occurrences that were already known to the Service. Two 
letters from the cities of San Buenaventura and Santa Barbara cited 
possible impacts to goby habitat due to proposed or ongoing projects. 
These letters listed threats that are discussed under Factor A in the 
``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section. The Santa Barbara 
County Flood Control and Water Conservation District stated support for 
listing, but expressed concerns regarding the designation of critical 
habitat. 
The Environmental Defense Center identified three issues concerning 
the proposed rule. 


Issue 1:

 The critical habitat finding failed to meet the standards 
of section 4 of the Endangered Species Act and under 

Northern Spotted 
Owl

 v. 

Lujan,

 758 F. Supp. 621 (W.D. Wash. 1991). 


Service Response:

 The Service concurs that critical habitat should 
be designated for the tidewater goby. Information needed to complete 
required economic impact analyses consists of identifying Federal 
actions that might be precluded or modified by the destruction/adverse 
modification standard but not by the jeopardy standard. Moreover, it 
will be necessary to describe how these actions may be modified by 
application of the destruction/adverse modification standard. This 
information will provide a basis for analyses on the economic effects of 
designating critical habitat.

<TEXT>
 



Issue 2:

 Without critical habitat, the Service lacks jurisdiction 
to prevent or modify certain actions affecting the tidewater goby. 


Service Response:

 Although in some cases critical habitat may 
provide protection otherwise unavailable through the jeopardy standard, 
jurisdiction is available through the jeopardy standard and section 9, 
both of which may be aggressively applied to protect listed species. 


Issue 3:

 The Service should at minimum propose the Santa Ynez 
estuary as critical habitat now. 


Service Response:

 The Service intends to propose as critical 
habitat all tidewater goby habitat that may be essential to the species' 
conservation, as opposed to the piecemeal approach advocated in the 
recommendation to propose one estuary. In the interim, the Santa Ynez 
estuary is owned by the U.S. Air Force, which is subject to the section 
7(a)(1) affirmative conservation mandate and the prohibitions against 
jeopardy contained in section 7(a)(2). 


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


After a thorough review and consideration of all information 
available, the Service has determined that the tidewater goby should be 
classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of 
the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 
CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act 
were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or 
threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in 
section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the tidewater 
goby (

Eucyclogobius newberryi

) are as follows: 


A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of its habitat or range.

 Coastal development projects that 
result in the loss of coastal saltmarsh habitat are currently the major 
factor adversely affecting the tidewater goby. Coastal marsh habitats 
have been drained and reclaimed for residential and industrial 
developments. Waterways have been dredged for navigation and harbors 
resulting in permanent and direct losses of wetland habitats, as well as 
indirect losses due to associated changes in salinity. Coastal road 
construction projects have severed the connection between marshes and 
the ocean, resulting in unnatural temperature and salinity profiles that 
the tidewater goby cannot tolerate. 
Furthermore, upstream water diversions adversely affect the 
tidewater goby by altering downstream flows, thereby diminishing the 
extent of marsh habitats that occurred historically at the mouths of 
most rivers and creeks in California. Alterations of flows upstream of 
coastal lagoons have already changed the distribution of downstream 
salinity regimes. Since the tidewater goby has relatively narrow 
salinity tolerances, changes in salinity distributions due to upstream 
water diversions may adversely affect both the size and distribution of 
goby populations (D. Holland, Univ. of Southwestern Louisiana, pers. 
comm., 1991). 
Historically, the tidewater goby occurred in at least 87 of 
California's coastal lagoons (Swift 

et al.

 1989). Since 1900, it has 
disappeared from approximately 50 percent of formerly occupied lagoons. 
A rangewide status survey conducted in 1984 found that 22 historic 
populations of tidewater goby had been extirpated (Swift 

et al.

 1989). 
Only 5 years later, a status survey documented the disappearance of an 
additional 21 populations. In the San Francisco Bay area, 9 of 10 
previously identified populations have disappeared (Swift 

et al.

 1989, 
1990). Losses in the southern part of the State have been the greatest, 
including 74 percent of the coastal lagoons south of Morro Bay. Three 
populations currently remain south of Ventura County. Since 1989, three 
additional tidewater goby populations have been lost in San Luis Obispo 
and Santa Cruz Counties (Swift 

et al.

 1989, 1990). Five small 
populations have been rediscovered since 1984, but the overall losses 
indicate a decline of 35 percent rangewide in 6 years (Holland 1991a, 
1991b, 1991c; Swift 

et al.

 1991). 
Of the 43 remaining populations of tidewater gobies identified by 
Swift 

et al.

 (1990), most are small and threatened by a variety of human 
and natural factors. According to Swift 

et al.

 (1990), only eight 
extant localities contain populations that are considered large enough 
and free enough from habitat degradation to be safe for the immediate 
future. These areas are all located north of San Francisco Bay. The 
remaining lagoons are so small or modified that tidewater goby 
populations are restricted in distribution and vulnerable to elimination 
(Swift 

et al.

 1989, 1990). The number of extirpated localities of 
gobies has left remaining populations so widely separated throughout 
most of the species' range that recolonization is unlikely. 
Several specific proposed and ongoing coastal development 
activities threaten habitats supporting tidewater gobies, including road 
widening and bridge replacement projects along Highway 101, water 
diversion projects in San Luis Obispo County, expansion of several State 
Park Recreation areas in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties, and 
hotel and golf course developments in San Luis Obispo and Marin 
Counties.

In addition to these specific threats, the tidewater goby is vulnerable throughout its remaining range because of
the loss of coastal marsh, as noted above, and because of other effects of water diversions as well. In addition to restricting
the goby's overall range by 
altering downstream salinities, water diversions and alterations of 
water flows may negatively impact the species' breeding and foraging 
activities. Gobies in southern and central California breed primarily 
in sand/mud substrates and apparently avoid areas that contain large 
amounts of decaying vegetation (Holland 1991b). Reductions in water 
flows may allow aggressive plant species to colonize the otherwise bare 
sand/mud substrates of coastal lagoon margins, thus degrading the 
habitat quality for the goby. Decreases in stream flows also reduce the 
deep stream pools utilized by gobies venturing upstream from lagoons. 
In San Luis Obispo County alone, the effects of drought, either directly 
or exacerbated by upstream water diversions, have been responsible for 
the extirpation of at least three populations of gobies between 1986 to 
1990 (K. Worcester, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 
1991). 


The tidewater goby is also adversely affected by groundwater 
overdrafting and discharge of agricultural and sewage effluents. For 
example, in Santa Barbara County, increased groundwater pumpage and 
siltation from topsoil runoff in the San Antonio Creek drainage has 
significantly affected areas immediately upstream of occupied goby 
habitat (i.e., Barka Slough) (C. Swift, Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History, pers. comm., 1991). Enrichment by agricultural and 
sewage effluents may cause algal blooms and deoxygenation that restrict 
habitable areas of lagoons utilized by tidewater gobies, especially in 
summer (Swift 

et al. 

1989). The potential for these factors to degrade 
remaining goby habitats has also been noted at all three extant 
localities south of Ventura County (D. Holland, pers. comm., 1991) and 
at several sites along the central California coast (T. Taylor, 
California State Parks and Recreation, pers. comm., 1991; K. Worcester, 
pers. comm., 1991). 


The tidewater goby is further threatened by channelization of the 
rivers it inhabits. Because most of the goby's localities have been 
moderately to extremely channelized, winter floods scour the species out 
of the restricted channelized areas where no protection is afforded from 
such high flows. This type of event was responsible for the 
disappearance of gobies from Waddell Creek lagoon in the winter 1972-73 
(C. Swift, pers. comm., 1991). 


Finally, cattle grazing and feral pig activity present a threat to 
the existence of the tidewater goby. These activities have resulted in 
increased sedimentation of coastal lagoons and riparian habitats, 
removal of vegetative cover, increased ambient water temperatures, and 
elimination of plunge pools and collapsed undercut banks utilized by 
tidewater gobies. In San Luis Obispo County, increased sedimentation 
into Morro Bay has significantly accelerated the conversion of wetland 
habitats to upland habitats (Josselyn 

et al. 

1989). Presently, cattle 
continue to graze freely both upstream and in many of the coastal 
lagoons supporting tidewater gobies (K. Worcester, pers. comm., 1991). 




B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes. 

Not known to be applicable. 



C. Disease or predation. 

Over the past 20 years, at least 60 
species of exotic fishes have been introduced to the western United 
States, 59 percent of which are predatory (Hayes and Jennings 1986, 
Jennings 1988). The introduction of exotic predators to southern 
California waters has been facilitated by the interbasin transport of 
water (e.g., California Aqueduct). Introduced predators, particularly 
centrarchid fishes, may have contributed to the elimination of the 
tidewater goby from several localities in California (Swift 

et al

. 
1989). The present day absence of the tidewater goby from the San 
Francisco delta area may well be explained by the presence of introduced 
predators such as striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and native predators 
including the Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) (Swift 

et al. 


1989, 1990). Two of the most recent disappearances of gobies from San 
Luis Obispo County (Old Creek) and San Diego County (San Onofre Creek) 
are likely due to the presence of exotic largemouth bass (

Micropterous 
salmoides

) and green sunfish (

Lepomis cyanellus

), respectively. Natural predation on gobies by rainbow trout (

Oncorhynchus mykiss

) has been documented (Swift 

et al

. 1989). Other non-native predators, 
specifically crayfish (

Cambarus

 spp.) and mosquitofish (

Gambusia 

spp.), may also threaten goby populations through direct predation on adults, larvae, or eggs. 




D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 

Section 10 
of the Rivers and Harbors Act and section 404 of the Clean Water Act 
regulate the placement of dredge and fill materials into waters of the 
United States. Under section 404, nationwide permits, which undergo 
minimal public and agency review, can be issued for projects involving 
less than 10 acres of waters of the United States and adjacent wetlands, 
unless a listed species may be adversely affected. Individual permits, 
which are subject to more extensive review, are required for projects 
that affect greater than 10 acres. 



The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is the agency responsible 
for administering the section 10 and section 404 programs. The Service, 
as part of the section 404 review process, provides comments on both 
predischarge notices for nationwide permits and public notices for 
individual permits. The Service's comments are only advisory, although 
procedures exist for elevation when disagreements between the agencies 
arise. In practice, the Corps' actions under section 10 and section 404 
are insufficient to protect the tidewater goby. 


Most projects within the range of the tidewater goby considered in 
this proposal may require approval from the Corps as currently described 
in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Projects proposed in coastal 
lagoons may also require a permit under section 10 of the Rivers and 
Harbors Act. Federal listing of this species requires Federal agencies 
to insure their actions are not likely to jeopardize the tidewater 
goby's continued existence or destroy or adversely modify any habitat 
that is designated as critical. 


The National Environmental Policy Act and California Environmental 
Quality Act require an intensive environmental review of projects that 
may adversely affect Federal candidate species. However, project 
proponents are not required to avoid impacts to these species, and 
proposed mitigation measures are frequently not adequately implemented. 
As with section 404 permits, the Service's comments through these 
environmental review processes are only advisory.

The California Coastal Act regulates the approval of developments 
within the coastal zone. Although a significant slowing in wetland 
losses has occurred, the continued loss and degradation of coastal 
wetlands since the California Coastal Act was enacted in 1974 attests 
to the limitations of this legislation. 



E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued 
existence. 

By far, the most significant natural factor adversely 
affecting the tidewater goby is drought and resultant deterioration of 
coastal and riparian habitats. California has recently experienced 5 
consecutive years of lower than average rainfall. These drought 
conditions, when combined with human induced water reductions (i.e., 
diversions of water from streams, excessive groundwater withdrawals), 
have degraded coastal and riparian ecosystems and have created extremely 
stressful conditions for most aquatic species. Formerly large 
populations of tidewater gobies have declined in numbers because of the 
reduced availability of suitable lagoon habitats (i.e., San Simeon 
Creek, Pico Creek), others disappeared when the lagoons dried (i.e., 
Santa Rosa Creek). In San Luis Obispo County alone, 6 of 20 populations 
of tidewater gobies were extirpated between 1984 and 1989 because of 
drought, water diversions, and pollution (K. Worcester, pers. comm., 
1991). 

Habitat degradation and losses of the tidewater goby from weather 
related phenomena commonly occur due to the restriction of the species 
to coastal lagoon systems and its dependence on freshwater inflows. 
Events such as river flooding and heavy rainfall have been reported to 
destroy goby burrows and wash gobies out to sea. Storm surges that 
enter a lagoon may also adversely affect entire goby populations by 
rapidly changing its salinity. 

The tidewater goby was undoubtedly subjected to such natural flood 
events even before major human alteration of drainage basins. As 
mentioned under Factor A, channelization and urbanization have increased 
the frequency and perhaps the intensity of such flood events. In 
addition, populations of gobies are becoming more isolated from one 
another as intervening populations are extirpated, thus further 
decreasing the likelihood of successfully colonizing and reestablishing 
a population lost to a ``natural'' flood. 

Competition with introduced species is a potential threat to the 
tidewater goby. Although problems have not been documented so far, the 
spread of two introduced oriental gobies (yellowfin goby (

Acanthogobius 
flavimanus

) and chameleon goby (

Tridentiger trigonocephalus

)) may have a detrimental effect on the tidewater goby. According to Swift 

et al. 


(1990), the chameleon goby was recently found in Pyramid Lake, probably 
imported with central California water. If this goby becomes 
established in the Santa Clara River as other imported species have 
(e.g., prickly sculpin (

Cottus asper

)), the tidewater goby population at 
the mouth of the Santa Clara River may be at risk. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
threats faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. 
The tidewater goby has been extirpated from nearly 50 percent of the 
lagoons within its historic range, including 74 percent of the lagoons 
south of Morro Bay. Forty-three populations remain; however, only six 
are large in number and reasonably free from immediate threats. Based 
on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the tidewater goby 
as endangered. The tidewater goby has experienced a substantial decline 
throughout its historic range and faces threats indicating that this 
downward trend is likely to continue. This species lives within 
specific habitat zones that have been, and will continue to be, targeted 
for development and degradation by human activities. The goby is 
extremely vulnerable to adverse habitat modification and water quality 
changes. The tidewater goby is in imminent danger of extinction 
throughout its range and requires the full protection of listing as 
endangered under the Act to survive. For reasons discussed below, the 
Service is not proposing to designate critical habitat for this fish 
species at this time.

Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the 
maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate 
critical habitat concurrently with determining a species to be 
endangered or threatened. Furthermore, the Service is to designate 
critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available after taking into consideration the economic and other 
relevant impacts of specifying an area as critical habitat (16 U.S.C. 
1533(b)(2)). In the case of the tidewater goby, critical habitat is not 
presently determinable. A final designation of critical habitat 
requires detailed information on the possible economic effects of such a 
designation. The Service does not currently have sufficient information 
needed to perform the economic analysis. A delay in the determination 
to list the species to gather additional information and perform 
analyses would not serve the needs of the species. Information is 
needed on actions that may be proposed within tidewater goby habitat and 
the degree to which a designation of critical habitat may affect these 
actions over and above effects associated with listing the goby as 
endangered (i.e., the jeopardy standard alone). It will also be 
necessary to determine how and to what extent application of the 
destruction/adverse modification standard will change various Federal 
actions. These data will be used in the economic analyses to determine 
the economic effects of critical habitat designation. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, 
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions 
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and 
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, 
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for 
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires 
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The 
protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against 
taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that 
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or 
adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency 
must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 
A number of Federal agencies or departments control lands that 
support the tidewater goby. These include the Department of Defense 
(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. 
Marine Corps), Department of Agriculture (U.S. Forest Service), and 
Department of the Interior (National Park Service and U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service). Federal actions that may be affected by this 
determination would be the funding or authorization of projects within 
the species' habitat, including the construction of roads, bridges, and 
dredging projects subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 
U.S.C. 1344 

et seq.

) and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 
1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 

et seq.

), and special use permits. Other Federal 
actions that are subject to environmental review under the National 
Environmental Policy Act would also require consultation with the 
Service. Projects on federally owned land would also be subject to the 
provisions of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.

The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set 
forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all 
endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, would make it illegal 
for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take 
(includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, 
or collect; or attempt any of these), import or export, transport in 
interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or 
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed 
species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, 
transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. 
Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation 
agencies. 
The Act and 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23 also provide for the issuance of 
permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving 
endangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Such permits 
are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or 
survival of the species, for incidental take in connection with 
otherwise lawful activities, and for economic hardship under certain 
circumstances. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants 
and wildlife and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Permit Branch, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181,
telephone 503/231-6241,

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines 
endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (Act), for three plants: 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 
(Ben Lomond spineflower (also previously known as Hartweg's 
spineflower)), 

Chorizanthe robusta

 (inclusive of var. 

hartwegii

 and var. 

robusta

) (robust spineflower), and 

Erysimum teretifolium

 (Ben Lomond 
wallflower). The Service also determines threatened status for one 
plant: 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 (Monterey spineflower). These 
four taxa occur in coastal habitats of southern Santa Cruz and northern 
Monterey Counties and are imperiled by one or more of the following 
factors: Habitat destruction due to residential and golf course 
development, agricultural land conversion, sand mining, military 
activities, and encroachment by alien plant species. This rule 
implements the protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act 
for these plants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 





Chorizanthe pungens

 Benth. var. 

hartwegiana

 Reveal & Hardham, 


Chorizanthe robusta

 Parry var. 

hartwegii

 (Benth. in A. DC), and 

Erysimum

 


teretifolium

 Eastwood are endemic to sandstone and mudstone deposits in the Santa Cruz Mountains in Santa Cruz County, California.



Chorizanthe pungens

 Benth var. 

pungens

 and 

Chorizanthe robusta

 Parry 
var. 

robusta

 are endemic to sandy soils of coastal habitats in southern 
Santa Cruz and northern Monterey Counties. 

The Santa Cruz Mountains are a relatively young range composed of 
igneous and metamorphic rocks overlain by thick layers of sedimentary 
material uplifted from the ocean floor and ancient shoreline zone 
(Caughman and Ginsberg 1987). These ancient marine terraces persist as 
pockets of sandstones and limestones that are geologically distinct from 
the volcanic origins of the range. Soils that form from these sandstone 
and limestone deposits tend to be coarse and, at least surficially, lose 
soil moisture rapidly. The more mesic slopes of the Santa Cruz 
Mountains are covered primarily by redwood forest (Zinke 1988) and mixed 
evergreen forest (Sawyer 

et al

. 1988). 

In contrast, the drier pockets of sandstone and limestone, referred 
to as the ``Ben Lomond sandhills'' (Thomas 1961), support two unique 
communities_maritime coast range ponderosa pine forest and northern 
maritime chaparral (Griffin 1964, Holland 1986). The ponderosa pine 
forest, locally referred to as ``ponderosa pine sandhill'' or ``ponderosa 
pine sand parkland'' (California Native Plant Society 1986, Marangio and 
Morgan 1987), consists of an open park-like forest of scattered 
ponderosa pine (

Pinus ponderosa

) with knobcone pine (

Pinus attenuata

), 
coast live oak (

Quercus agrifolia

), and at a few sites, the federally 
endangered Santa Cruz cypress (

Cupressus abramsii

). These stands 
intergrade with another unique community, northern maritime chaparral, 
locally referred to as silver-leaf manzanita mixed chaparral (Marangio 
1985, Marangio and Morgan 1987), and are dominated by the endemic 
silver-leaved manzanita (

Arctostaphylos silvicola

). 

As uplift of the Santa Cruz Mountains proceeded, some of the raised 
marine terraces of sandstone and limestone were buried beneath layers of 
sedimentary material deposited by flowing water. Pockets of this 
alluvial material, referred to as Santa Cruz mudstone, persisted during 
this process of mountain uplifting and alluvial movement. In the Scotts 
Valley area, mudstone outcrops support annual grasses and herbaceous 
species. These communities were referred to as annual grasslands and 
wildflower fields by Holland (1986). 



Discussion of the Four Species 



In California, the spineflower genus (

Chorizanthe

) in the buckwheat 
family (Polygonaceae) comprises species of wiry annual herbs that 
inhabit dry sandy soils along the coast and inland. Because of the 
patchy and limited distribution of such soils, many species of 


Chorizanthe

 tend to be highly localized in their distribution. 

One subsection of the genus referred to as 

Pungentes

 consists of 
seven species distinguished by the following features: The inner and 
outer tepals (petal-like sepals) are of equal length and are entire or 
lobed but not fringed, filaments are free, involucres (whorl of bracts 
subtending the flowers) are 6-toothed with the alternating three shorter 
and the anterior one slightly long-awned, involucral margins are not 
continuously membranaceous across the sinuses, the number of stamens are 
variable (3-9), and plants are decumbent to erect with spreading 
pubescence and are distributed mainly on or near the coast from Santa 
Barbara County northward to Mendocino (Reveal and Hardham 1989). 

Although three of the seven species in the section 

Pungentes

 are 
still thought to be common, the remaining four species are becoming 
increasingly rare. Two of these species (

Chorizanthe howellii

 and 

C. 
valida

) were listed as endangered on June 22, 1992 (57 FR 27848). The 
remaining two species, 

C. pungens

 and 

C. robusta

, inclusive of their varieties, are subjects of this rule. 



Chorizanthe pungens

 was first described by George Bentham in 1836 
based on a specimen collected in Monterey. This taxon was recognized by 
George Goodman in 1934 as the type species in describing the 

Pungentes

 
section of the genus. At that time, Goodman also recognized 

C. pungens

 
var. 

hartwegii

, previously described and identified as 

C. douglasii

 var. 

hartwegii

 by Bentham in 1856. It was named after Karl Hartweg who 
collected the type from ``dry mountain pastures near Santa Cruz'' in 1847 
(Reveal and Hardham 1989).

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 was distinguished from 

C. 
pungens

 var. 

pungens

 by James Reveal and Clare Hardham (1989) after they noticed a difference between the coastal form and an inland form
found 
``in the Ben Lomond sand hills area.'' The name 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 


pungens

 was retained to represent the coastal form of the plant. Reveal 
and Hardham noted that the type for 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 was dissimilar to the plant that was called 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegii

. 

The recent article describing 

Chorizanthe

 (Reveal and Hardham 1989) 
treats 

C. pungens

 var. 

pungens

 and 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 as distinct varieties. Though Hickman (1993) did not treat 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 separately in The Jepson Manual, he did state that plants with ``more erect petals with pink to purple involucral 
margins have been called var. 

hartwegiana

 Rev. & Hardham.'' For the 
purposes of this final rule, the Service lists 

C. pungens

 var. 

pungens

 and 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 separately because the former variety 
qualifies for threatened status and the latter qualifies for endangered 
status under the Act. Even if the conservative Hickman (1993) treatment 
were used, 

C. pungens

 (inclusive of vars. 

pungens

 and 

hartwegiana

) faces the same threats as described under the section entitled ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' and
would qualify for listing under the 
Act. 



Chorizanthe robusta

 was first described by Charles Parry in 1889 
based on a collection he made 6 years earlier ``north of Aptos along 
Monterey Bay'' (Parry 1889). Willis Jepson considered it to be a variety 
of 

C. pungens

 and thus combined the taxon under the name 

C. pungens

 var. 

robusta

 in his Flora of California in 1914 (Jepson 1914). In their revision of the genus in 1989, Reveal and Hardham (1989) recognized
Parry's treatment and retained the taxon as 

C. robusta

. Although they placed in this synonymy the type of 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegii

, Reveal 
and Hardham noted that the definition of the taxon was still not settled 
with their review. 

Concurrent with the publication of the Reveal and Hardham revision, 
the first collection in over 50 years was made of the inland form that 
matched Hartweg's original collection made in 1847. Reveal was 
therefore able to reconfirm its affinity with 

Chorizanthe robusta

, while 
recognizing the distinctness of this taxon as a variety. Reveal, along 
with local botanist Randall Morgan, published the combination 

C. robusta

 
var.

 hartwegii

 (Reveal and Morgan 1989), inclusive of the type of 

C. 
pungens

 var. 

hartwegii

. 

The recent article describing 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 
(Reveal and Morgan 1989) treats 

C. robusta

 var. 

robusta

 and 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 as distinct varieties. Though Hickman (1993) did not treat 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 separately in The Jepson Manual, he did state that plants with ``more erect petals with pink involucral margins have
been called var. 

hartwegii

 (Benth.) Rev. & R. Morgan.'' For the 
purposes of this listing, the Service adds the entire species of 

C. 
robusta

 (inclusive of 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 and 

C. robusta

 var. 

robusta

) to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. 

During the Service's review of a petition to list 

Chorizanthe

 


robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

, Dr. John Thomas questioned the taxonomic 
validity of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 (John Thomas, Stanford University, 

in litt.,

 1990). To address these concerns, the Service 
reviewed specimens of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 and other 
closely related taxa in the 

Pungentes

 subsection of the genus with plant 
taxonomists at the University of California. The Service's review 
indicates that specimens ascribed to 

C. pungens

 and 

C. robusta

 have five 
morphologically recognizable phases that correspond to ecological and 
geographical patterns. Four of these five phases generally correspond 
to 

C. pungens

 var. 

pungens

, 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana, C. robusta

 var. 


robusta

, and 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

. The fifth phase consists of specimens that were identified as 

C. robusta

 or 

C. pungens

 (Ertter 
1990). This final rule, by addressing the subject four varieties of 


Chorizanthe

, includes all five phases reviewed. 



Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 and 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 


robusta

 are endemic to sandy soils of coastal habitats in southern Santa 
Cruz and northern Monterey Counties. The inner rim of Monterey Bay is 
characterized by broad, sandy beaches backed by an extensive dune 
formation. Just inland from the immediate coast, maritime chaparral occupies areas with well-drained soils. Coastal
dune and coastal scrub 
communities exist along the inner rim of Monterey Bay, but portions were 
affected by habitat modification or destruction.

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

(Monterey spineflower) has white 
(rarely pinkish) scarious margins on the involucral lobes and a 
prostrate to slightly ascending habit that distinguish it from 


Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana. 

The aggregate of flowers (heads) 
tend to be small (less than 1 centimeter (cm) (0.4 inches (in)) in 
diameter) and either distinctly or indistinctly aggregate. The plant is 
found scattered on sandy soils within coastal dune, coastal scrub, 
grassland, maritime chaparral, and oak woodland communities along and 
adjacent to the coast of southern Santa Cruz and northern Monterey 
Counties and inland to the coastal plain of Salinas Valley. 
Historically, the plant ranged along the coast from southern Santa Cruz 
County south to northern San Luis Obispo County and from Monterey inland 
to the Salinas Valley. Only one collection dating from 1842 was made 
from northern San Luis Obispo County; however, in recent years it was 
not collected south of Monterey Peninsula (Reveal and Hardham 1989). 
Along the immediate coast, 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

was 
documented at Manresa State Beach and the dunes near Marina. The plant 
probably was extirpated from a number of historical locations in the 
Salinas Valley, primarily due to conversion of the original grasslands 
and valley oak woodlands to agricultural crops (Reveal and Hardham 
1989). Significant populations of 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens, 


representing upwards of 70 percent of the range of the plant, were 
recently documented from Fort Ord (Army Corps of Engineers 1992). These 
surveys indicated that within grassland communities the plant occurs 
along roadsides, in firebreaks, and in other disturbed sites. In oak 
woodland, chaparral, and scrub communities, the plants occur in sandy 
openings between shrubs. In older stands with a high cover of shrubs, 
the plant is restricted to roadsides and firebreaks that bisect these 
communities. The highest densities of 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens 

are 
located in the central portion of the firing range, where disturbance is 
the most frequent. Although studies were not conducted on factors that 
determine the pattern of distribution and the densities of 

C. pungens 


var. 

pungens 

on Fort Ord, a correlation exists between open conditions 
resulting from activities that disturb habitat and high densities of 

C. 
pungens 

var. 

pungens. 

Prior to onset of human use of this area, this 
species was possibly restricted to openings created by wildfires within 
these communities. 


Chorizanthe robusta 

(robust spineflower) is comprised of two 
varieties: 

C. robusta 

var. 

robusta 

and 

C. robusta 

var. 

hartwegii. 

A 
description of the species is broken out below by variety. 


Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

robusta 

has thin white to pinkish scarious 
margins along the basal portions of the teeth and an erect to spreading 
or prostrate habit. The heads are large (1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in) in 
diameter) and distinctly aggregate. The plant once ranged from Alameda 
to Monterey Counties, but is currently known only from sandy and 
gravelly soils along and adjacent to the coast of southern Santa Cruz 
and northern Monterey Counties. Many of the areas from which 
collections were made in Alameda and San Mateo Counties were urbanized, 
and no new collections were made from there or from Monterey County for 
30 years (Ertter 1990). As with 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens, 

the coastal 
dune and scrub communities were affected by recreational use, urban 
development, and military activities, and the coastal plain vegetation 
of the Salinas Valley was converted to agricultural crops. The only 
known extant populations occur northeast of the city of Santa Cruz on 
property recently acquired by the city from the University of California 
and near Sunset and Manresa State Beaches, approximately 12 miles away. 
The total number of individuals of the plant was estimated to be less 
than 7,000 in 1990. 

Specimens collected from certain populations of 

Chorizanthe 

in the 
vicinity of Sunset State Beach are ``comparable to 

Chorizanthe pungens

'' 
according to Ertter (1990). The Service believes that these populations 
are best assigned to 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens. 
Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

has rose-pink involucral margins 
confined to the basal portion of the teeth and an erect habit. The 
heads are medium in size (1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in diameter) and 
distinctly aggregate. The plant is endemic to Purisima sandstone and 
Santa Cruz mudstone in Scotts Valley in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Where 


C. robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

occurs on Purisima sandstone, the bedrock is 
overlain with a thin soil layer that supports a meadow community 
comprised of herbs and low-growing grasses. The presence of certain 
associated species, such as toad rush (

Juncus bufonis

), sand pigmyweed 
(

Crassula erecta

), mosses, and lichens, suggest a high seasonal moisture 
content. Where the plant occurs on Santa Cruz mudstone, the bedrock is 
variously mixed with scree or a thin soil layer that also supports a 
meadow community of herbs and grasses, though of somewhat different 
composition than those on Purisima sandstone, and with a lower frequency 
of toadrush, pigmyweed, and lichens (Habitat Restoration Group 1992).

The only known extant populations of 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 


hartwegii 

occur in Scotts Valley in the Santa Cruz Mountains north of 
the city of Santa Cruz. The plant occurs primarily on pockets of Santa 
Cruz mudstones and Purisima sandstones and is associated with annual 
grasslands and wildflower fields (Reveal and Morgan 1989). These 
islands of unique substrates are host to a number of rare plants. Three 
populations of the plant, each consisting of numerous small colonies, 
are scattered over an area 1 mile in diameter on three parcels in 
private ownership. In 1989, shortly after the taxon was rediscovered, 
the total number of individuals was estimated to be approximately 6,000 
(California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB) 1990). As a result of 
two proposals for development that were pending at the time, additional 
surveys were conducted during the next few years. Results of 1992 
surveys were that the two populations on land proposed for a development 
named Glenwood Estates totalled between 30,000 and 100,000 individuals 
(Habitat Restoration Group 1992). The numbers of this annual plant are 
expected to fluctuate from year to year, depending on climatic 
conditions. 


Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana 

(Ben Lomond spineflower) has 
dark pinkish to purple scarious margins on the involucral lobes and a 
slightly ascending to erect habit. The heads are medium in size (1 to 
1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in diameter) and distinctly aggregate. The plant 
is found on sandy soils that are the basis for the Ben Lomond sandhills 
communities in the Santa Cruz Mountains, mostly on privately owned land. 


C. pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana 

is confined to outcrops of sandstone soils 
in the Santa Cruz Mountains from Big Basin State Park to the Felton area 
in the Santa Cruz Mountains. These sandstone soils support several 
unique plant communities, including the ponderosa pine-dominated Ben 
Lomond sandhills. The majority of occurrences of 

C. pungens 

var. 


hartwegiana 

are found on privately owned lands within the area generally 
bounded by the communities of Ben Lomond, Glenwood, Scotts Valley, and 
Felton. 


Erysimum teretifolium 

(Ben Lomond wallflower) was first collected 
at Glenwood, Santa Cruz County, by Horace Davis in 1914. This plant was 
described by Alice Eastwood in 1938 as 

E. filifolium, 

not realizing that 
this combination was already applied to another plant (Eastwood 1938). 
It was therefore renamed 

E. teretifolium 

in the following year (Eastwood 
1939). 

E. teretifolium 

is a biennial, or occasionally an annual, plant 
of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Seedlings form a basal rosette of 
leaves, which then wither as the main stem develops flowers clustered in 
a terminal raceme. The flowers are a deep yellow with petals 1.3 to 2.5 
cm (0.5 to 1.0 in) long; the slender capsule reaches 10 cm (4.0 in) in 
length and is covered with three-parted hairs. The leaves are simple 
and narrowly linear, a characteristic that separates this plant from 
other wallflowers. 


Erysimum teretifolium 

is endemic to pockets of sandstone deposits 
in the Santa Cruz Mountains and is presently known from only a dozen 
scattered occurrences. These sandstone deposits support the unique 
ponderosa pine sandhill community, and 

E. teretifolium 

seems to prefer 
sites with loose, uncompacted sand in openings between scattered 
chaparral shrubs. 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

robusta 

is found in close 
proximity with 

E. teretifolium 

at some locations. A dozen populations 
of 

E. teretifolium 

occur within the area generally bounded by the 
communities of Ben Lomond, Glenwood, Scotts Valley, and Felton, with one 
outlying population occurring in the Bonny Doon area, 5 miles west of 
Felton. One population occurs at Quail Hollow Ranch, which is jointly 
owned by Santa Cruz County, The Nature Conservancy, and the California 
Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). All other populations are on 
privately owned lands.

Previous Federal Action 


Federal government actions for one of these four plants began as a 
result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which 
directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a 
report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or 
extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was 
presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In the report, 

Erysimum 
teretifolium 

was recommended for threatened status. On July 1, 1975, 
the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of 
its acceptance of the report as a petition within the context of section 
4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act and of the Service's 
intention thereby to review the status of the plant taxa named within. 
The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on 
December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included 

Erysimum 
teretifolium 

as a category 1 candidate (species for which data in the 
Service's possession are sufficient to support proposals for listing) 
and 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

as a category 2 candidate (species 
for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing may be 
appropriate, but for which additional biological information is needed 
to support listing). In the September 27, 1985, revised notice of 
review for plants (50 FR 39526), 

E. teretifolium 

was again included as a 
category 1 candidate, and 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens 

as a category 2 
candidate. In the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184), notice of review for 
plants, 

E. teretifolium 

was retained in category 1 and 

Chorizanthe 
pungens 

var. 

pungens 

and 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana 

in category 2. 
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 
1982, requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending 
petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 
1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 
13, 1982, be treated as newly submitted on that date. This was the case 
for 

Erysimum teretifolium 

because the 1975 Smithsonian report was 
accepted as a petition. In October 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 
1989, and 1990, the Service found that the petitioned listing of 

E. 
teretifolium 

was warranted, but that the listing of this species was 
precluded by other pending proposals of higher priority. 
On May 16, 1990, the Service received a petition from Steve McCabe, 
president, and Randall Morgan of the Santa Cruz Chapter of the 
California Native Plant Society to list 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 


hartwegii 

as endangered. Based on a 90-day finding that the petition 
presented substantial information indicating that the requested action 
may be warranted (55 FR 46080), the Service initiated a status review of 
this taxon. During that time the Service also reviewed the status of 


Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

robusta. 

This final rule constitutes the 
Service's final finding that the listing of 

C. robusta, 

inclusive of 
var. 

robusta 

and var. 

hartwegii, 

as endangered, is warranted, and that the listing of 

Erysimum teretifolium 

as endangered is warranted. 
On October 24, 1991 (56 FR 55111), the Service published a proposal 
to list 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana, Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens, Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii, Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

robusta, 

and 

Erysimum teretifolium 

as endangered species. That proposal 
was based, in large part, on the survey information, occurrence data, 
and information on pending projects that would adversely affect the five 
plants. 

C. robusta 

consisted of varieties 

hartwegii 

and 

robusta 

at the 
time of the publication of the proposed rule. Because the two 

C. 
robusta 

varieties, 

hartwegii 

and 

robusta, 

qualify for endangered status, 
this rule lists the entire species. Hence this rule lists four plants, 
yet discusses each of the five varieties separately. The Service now 
determines 

C. pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana, C. robusta 

(inclusive of vars. 

hartwegii and robusta

), and 

E. teretifolium 

to be endangered species, and 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens 

to be a threatened species, with the publication of this rule. 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the October 24, 1991, proposed rule (56 FR 55111) and associated 
notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual 
reports or information that might contribute to the development of a 
final rule. A 60-day comment period closed on December 23, 1991. 
Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, 
scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted 
and requested to comment. A request for a public hearing was received 
from Allan Butler of APC International, Inc. On May 15, 1992, and again 
on May 26, 1992, the Service published notices in the 

Federal Register

 
(57 FR 20805 and 57 FR 21993) announcing the publication of the 
proposal, the public hearing, and the reopening of the comment period 
until July 15, 1992. A notice announcing the publication of the 
proposal and the public hearing was published in the Santa Cruz Sentinel 
on May 18, 1992. The Service conducted a hearing on June 4, 1992, at 
the Santa Cruz County Government Center in Santa Cruz. Testimony was 
taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Twenty-one parties presented testimony.

During the comment periods, the Service received written and oral 
comments from 48 parties. CDFG, California Department of Parks and 
Recreation, The Nature Conservancy, California Native Plant Society, 
National Audubon Society, Sierra Club, Environmental Council of Santa 
Cruz County, Southridge Watershed Association, and the Resource Defense 
Fund were some of the 38 commenters expressing support for the listing 
proposal. Eight commenters opposed the listing of 

Chorizanthe robusta 


var. 

hartwegii. 

The city of Marina opposed the listing of 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens. 

Two commenters, one of whom offered technical comments on the proposal, were neutral. In addition, results of additional
surveys for the plants (Army Corps of Engineers 1992, Habitat 
Restoration Group 1992) were incorporated into this final rule. 
Written comments and oral statements obtained during the public hearing 
and comment periods are combined in the following discussion. Opposing 
comments and other comments questioning the rule were organized into 
specific issues. These issues and the Service's response to each are 
summarized as follows: 


Issue 1: 

Several commenters felt that there was insufficient 
scientific evidence to list 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii. 

Others stated that the Service used data that were skewed or selectively chosen to support the listing of this plant;
``relied on the expertise of an 
amateur botanist whose opinion [is cited] without investigation of 
contrary opinions by, arguably, more qualified professionals;'' and did 
not utilize information supplied by Dr. Thomas that challenged the 
appropriateness of listing 

C. robusta 

var. 

hartwegii. 
Service Response: 

In preparing the proposed rule, the Service 
utilized information from botanical collections and observations that 
date from the mid-1800s, as well as data that were submitted to the 
Service in response to a request for information made to local and State 
agencies and other interested parties. The Service therefore maintains 
that the best available commercial and scientific information was 
utilized in preparation of the proposed rule. No data were submitted to 
support the contention that the Service skewed or selectively chose data 
to support the proposal. During preparation of the proposal, the 
Service consulted with a number of professional botanists, and other 
professional biologists commented during the comment period. These 
botanists and biologists gave biological bases that supported the 
listing of 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii. 

The Service, therefore, believes that this determination to list the plant as endangered under 

C. robusta 

is appropriate and is supported by the botanical community. 


Issue 2: 

Several commenters pointed out that the California Fish 
and Game Commission rejected a proposal to State list 

Chorizanthe 
robusta 

var. 

hartwegii, 

and it was, therefore, inappropriate for the 
Service to pursue Federal listing due to the ``doctrine of comity'' (the 
informal and voluntary recognition by courts of one jurisdiction of the 
laws and judicial decision of another). 


Service Response: 

The California Fish and Game Commission did not 
reject a proposal to State list 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii, 


rather it determined that not enough information was available to 
petition the plant for State listing. The opinions of the California 
Fish and Game Commission were not shared by CDFG, which supported the 
Federal listing at the public hearing and in writing (Ken Berg, CDFG, 
pers. comm., 1992). The Act does not require agreement among State 
agencies. Moreover, CDFG, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy 
and the California Native Plant Society, supplied the Service with data, 
through the CNDDB (1990), that supports Federal listing of the four 
plants.

Issue 3: 

A few commenters, citing Dr. John Thomas's opinions, stated that 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

is not a distinct taxon. Others contended that other botanical experts consulted by the Service ``did not reach a conclusion
which would change the above view'' and that their brief reviews were not definitive and did not resolve the taxonomic
questions that were raised. One commenter stated that a thorough taxonomic revision of the 

Pungentes 

subsection of the genus 

Chorizanthe 

was needed. 


Service Response: 

The Service believes that the recognized authority for the taxonomy of the buckwheat family, Dr. James Reveal, provided
sufficient data to support the taxonomic validity of 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii. 

Moreover, other botanical experts consulted by the Service did not provide any information that disputed the taxonomic
validity of this plant. The species 

C. robusta, 

inclusive of vars. 

robusta 

and 

hartwegii, 

faces threats as described under the section entitled ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' hence even if
the conservative Hickman (1993) treatment were used as in The Jepson Manual, the entire species would qualify for
listing under the Act. The Service agrees that additional taxonomic work on the 

Pungentes

 subsection of the genus 

Chorizanthe

 would be desirable, but maintains that the existing treatment is sufficient to proceed with the listing. 


Issue 4: 

Several commenters contended that adequate regulatory mechanisms are currently in place, through the California
Environmental Quality Act and the California Endangered Species Act, to protect 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii. 
Service Response: 

The only protection given to State-listed species is the requirement that landowners give CDFG 10 days notice of any
land use change. The California Environmental Quality Act requires mitigation for projects that adversely affect
listed plants as well as those that qualify for State listing; however, many mitigation attempts do not achieve the
goal of securing long-term protection for such plants (Howald 1992). The California Environmental Quality Act process
allowed the city of Scotts Valley to make a statement of overriding considerations to approve the Glenwood Development
Company's project even though the project will eliminate approximately two-thirds of the known habitat for 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

(City of Scotts Valley 1992). Furthermore, CDFG was unable to come to agreement with the Glenwood Development Company
on mitigation for impacts to the plant and compensation for unavoidable losses (Brian Hunter, CDFG, 

in litt.

, 1993). The failure of existing regulatory mechanisms to adequately protect the plant are further discussed under
Factor D in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section. 


Issue 5: 

One commenter claimed that the Service has no jurisdiction over 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

because it occurs on privately owned lands, and the plant is neither in interstate commerce nor the subject of an international
treaty and, therefore, is exclusively under the jurisdiction of the State. 


Service Response: 

Section 4 of the Act directs the Service to evaluate species for listing based on biological information only, not
land jurisdiction. The five factors on which the biological vulnerability of species are evaluated are discussed
in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section. Land ownership is not a factor used to determine whether
or not listing is appropriate. 


Issue 6: 

Two commenters stated that data concerning 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

were obtained in violation of State trespass laws on private land; therefore, such ``illegal evidence'' should be
excluded from consideration in the listing process. 


Service Response: 

The ``trespass'' issue does not involve the Service, and although the Service does not condone entering private land
without permission, it is charged with using the best commercially and scientifically available information in
preparation of a proposal. Moreover, information concerning the rarity of 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii, 

the threats to its continued existence, and information from surveys on private land were made part of the public record
in environmental assessments that were prepared as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (City of
Scotts Valley 1989, Harding Lawson Associates 1991).

Issue 7: 

Several commenters charged that the proposed rule for 


Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii 

was promulgated merely to fulfill requirements of a settlement resulting from the lawsuit filed against 
the Service by the California Native Plant Society. They further 
contended that this deprived Glenwood Development Company of its rights 
and is contrary to the intent and language of the Endangered Species 
Act. 


Service Response: 

The California Native Plant Society lawsuit 
settlement requires the Service to propose for listing those plant taxa 
that were identified as category 1 candidates for listing in the 
February 21, 1990, notice of review (56 FR 58804). Of the five taxa 
included in the proposed rule, only 

Erysimum teretifolium 

was a category 
1 candidate in the February 21, 1991, notice of review, and is the only 
one of the four taxa subject to the requirements of the lawsuit 
settlement. However, Federal action on all five taxa began prior to the 
settlement of the California Native Plant Society lawsuit (see section 
on ``Previous Federal Action''). As stated under the Service Response to 
Issue 5 above, the Endangered Species Act directs the Service to list 
species on the basis of biological vulnerability. 


Issue 8: 

One commenter stated that the Service failed to publish 
the proposed rule within 1 year of having received the petition, which 
therefore failed to meet statutory time requirements, and requested that 
the proposed rule be withdrawn. 


Service Response: 

The Service endeavors to meet statutory 
timeframes; however, nothing in the statute suggests that the Service is 
required to withdraw proposals because deadlines are missed. 


Issue 9: 

One commenter stated that the Service failed to prepare 
environmental assessments as required by the National Environmental 
Policy Act. 


Service Response: 

The Service is exempt from preparing 
environmental assessments regarding the listing of species pursuant to 
the National Environmental Policy Act for reasons outlined in the 


Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). This is stated in 
the proposed rule and this final rule under the section titled ``National 
Environmental Policy Act.'' 


Issue 10: 

One commenter stated that 

Erysimum teretifolium 

is a 
weed and that he had ``seen it in many places in the county'' and on ``all 
kinds of roadbanks,'' presumably meaning that the species is more 
widespread than is indicated in the proposed rule. He also felt that 
the public should be encouraged to grow it as a garden plant, presumably 
to assist in perpetuating the species. 


Service Response: 

No information was submitted to the Service to 
substantiate the locations of additional populations of 

Erysimum 
teretifolium

. Since the time the proposal was published, no 
documentation has been made of additional populations of the plant found 
by any botanists that contribute to CNDDB (CNDDB 1993). The Service, 
therefore, maintains that this decision is based on the best and most 
current information available and that it is sufficient to warrant 
making a determination on its status. With regard to the suggestion to 
cultivate 

E. teretifolium 

as a garden plant, the Service recognizes the 
value of maintaining cultivated collections of rare species. Such 
collections, however, do not replace protection for native ecosystems, 
which is the intent of the Endangered Species Act. 


Issue 11: 

Two agencies (CDFG and California Department of Parks 
and Recreation) recommended that the Service list 

Chorizanthe pungens

 
var. 

pungens 

as threatened rather than endangered. 


Service Response: 

Since publication of the proposal, the Service 
has reviewed additional biological information, including surveys for 


Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

recently conducted on Fort Ord by an environmental consulting firm, Jones and Stokes Associates (Army Corps 
of Engineers 1992). Substantial new populations were located on Fort 
Ord, but the pending disposal of Fort Ord still places these populations 
at risk. The Service therefore determined that threatened status for 
this plant is appropriate. 


Issue 12: 

Several commenters requested that the Service designate 
critical habitat for 

Chorizanthe robusta 

var. 

hartwegii.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940204-0-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940204-0-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Service Response

: Under section 4(a)(3)(A) of the Act, the 
Secretary must designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent 
and determinable at the time a species is determined to be endangered or 
threatened. In the proposed rule, the Service found that determination 
of critical habitat was not prudent for these species. As discussed 
under the ``Critical Habitat'' section below, the Service finds that 
designation of critical habitat for 

Chorizanthe robusta

, inclusive of 
vars. 

robusta

 and 

hartwegii

, is prudent but not determinable at this time. For certain populations that would likely not be imperiled by the 
threat of vandalism, collecting, or other human activities, the Service 
will propose designation of critical habitat. 



Issue 13

: One commenter expressed concern that several specimens 
of 

Chorizanthe

 collected by Yadon from Fort Ord, Monterey County, were 
not discussed in the proposed rule. The specimens were originally 
annotated as 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 by Dr. James Reveal. 



Service Response

: The specimens that were collected from Fort Ord 
were among those that were reviewed by taxonomists at the University 
Herbarium and the Jepson Herbarium at the University of California, 
Berkeley, prior to preparation of the proposed rule (Ertter 1990). In 
their report, the taxonomists indicated that the specimens belong in 


Chorizanthe douglasii

 rather than 

Chorizanthe robusta

. They cite the well-developed united involucral margins, a feature that separates the 
subsection Legnota (which includes 

Chorizanthe douglasii

) from the seven 
other subsections of the genus 

Chorizanthe

 (which includes the 
subsection Pungentes) that do not have united involucral margins (Ertter 
1990, Reveal and Hardham 1989). On the basis of this taxonomic review, 
the Service concludes that no confirmed collections of 

Chorizanthe 
robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 exist from Fort Ord or anywhere else in Monterey County. No additional discussion concerning the specimens from Fort
Ord has been included in the final rule. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



After a thorough review and consideration of all information 
available, the Service has determined that 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 


hartwegiana

 (Ben Lomond spineflower), 

Chorizanthe robusta

 (inclusive of vars. 

hartwegii

 and 

robusta

) (robust spineflower), and 

Erysimum teretifolium

 (Ben Lomond wallflower) should be classified as endangered species, and 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 (Monterey spineflower) should be classified as a threatened species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Endangered
Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species
may be determined to be 
an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors
and their application to 

Chorizanthe pungens

 Benth. var. 

hartwegiana

 Reveal & Hardham (Ben Lomond spineflower), 

Chorizanthe pungens

 Benth. var. 

pungens

 (Monterey spineflower), 

Chorizanthe robusta

 Parry (inclusive of 
var. 

hartwegii

 (Benth. in A. DC) Reveal & Morgan and var. 

robusta

) 
(robust spineflower), and 

Erysimum teretifolium

 Eastwood (Ben Lomond 
wallflower) are as follows:



A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range

. Three taxa (

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana, Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

, and 

Erysimum 
teretifolium

) are restricted to sandstone and mudstone soils in the 
Santa Cruz Mountains. Two taxa (

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 and 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

robusta

) are found only on sandy soils of coastal and near coastal habitats in southern Santa Cruz and northern 
Monterey Counties. These species and their associated habitats are 
threatened by one or more of the following: residential and golf course 
development, agricultural land conversion, recreational use, sand 
mining, dune stabilization projects, and military activities. 

Sand quarrying resulted in the direct removal of 

Chorizanthe 
pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 habitat, and a currently proposed expansion of 
operations at Quail Hollow Quarry may eliminate additional populations. 
Residential development on smaller parcels of privately owned lands also 
contributed to the elimination of 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 and the fragmentation of the remaining habitat. Protective management for 
sandhill parkland communities will be developed for one parcel recently 
acquired by the State of California.

In the 1870s, limestone quarries began operating in the Bonny Doon 
area of the Santa Cruz Mountains, as well as in other locations around 
the county (Caughman and Ginsberg 1987). In more recent years, sand 
quarrying replaced limestone mining as a viable economic activity. At 
least half of the habitat occupied by 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 


hartwegiana

 is on property owned by sand and gravel companies. 
Operations at a number of quarries, including Kaiser 1 and 2, Olympia, 
and Quail Hollow, have already extirpated populations of 

Erysimum 
teretifolium

 (Randall Morgan, botanist, Soquel, California, pers. comm., 
1990). Expanded operations are currently proposed for Quail Hollow 
Quarry (John Gilchrist and Associates 1990, Strelow 1993). One parcel 
(Quail Hollow Ranch), which was recently acquired by Santa Cruz County 
and the State of California, supports a large population of 

Chorizanthe 
pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

, as well as other unique species of the 
sandhill parklands habitat. Management plans for Quail Hollow Ranch are 
under development by Santa Cruz County, hence proposed recreational 
facilities may affect populations of both 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 and 

E. teretifolium

 (County of Santa Cruz 1990). Another parcel owned by the San Lorenzo Valley Water District also supports several of
the unique elements of the Ben Lomond sandhills habitat, including 


Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

. This parcel was badly damaged by off-road vehicles despite efforts to fence off the area by the District. Small populations
of 

C. pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 are also known to occur at the Bonny Doon Ecological Preserve, managed by The Nature Conservancy, and at Big Basin and
Henry Cowell State Parks. These 
parks, however, have not yet developed management plans for 

C. pungens

 
var. 

hartwegiana

. 

The remaining coastal dune and coastal scrub habitats that support 


Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 were affected by industrial and 
residential development, recreational use, and dune stabilization due to 
the introduction of non-native species. Along the coast of the north 
side of Monterey Peninsula, human and equestrian use threaten scattered 
occurrences of 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

, and a development is planned for a parcel owned by the Pebble Beach Corporation (Vern Yadon, 
retired, Museum of Natural History, Pacific Grove, pers. comm., 1991). 
Other small scattered occurrences within maritime chaparral habitat may 
become affected by residential development and by a realignment of 
Highway 101. 



Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 was probably extirpated from a number of historical locations in the Salinas Valley, primarily due to 
conversion of the original grassland and valley oak woodland habitat to 
agricultural crops. One occurrence at Manzanita County Park near 
Prunedale currently is not protected. A route realignment proposed for 
Highway 101 in northern Monterey County could destroy scattered 
occurrences (R. Morgan, pers. comm., 1991). 

The Fort Ord Army Base probably supports the largest extant 
population of 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

. In recent years, road development and construction of an ammunition supply depot on the base 
eliminated some 

C. pungens

 var. 

pungens

 habitat, and fragmented the remaining habitat. As mitigation for recent construction, the 
Department of Defense, with the assistance of the California Native 
Plant Society, established a series of small preserves, ranging in size 
from 1 to 15 acres, for the purpose of protecting rare species, 
including 

C. pungens

 var. 

pungens

. The small size of these preserves, 
however, is not likely to be sufficient to ensure long-term protection 
for the plant. Just prior to publication of the proposal to list the 
five taxa under discussion, the Department of Defense announced 
intentions to close the base at Fort Ord. The impact that base closure 
will have on 

C. pungens

 var. 

pungens

 is not known at this time but will 
largely be determined by the intended uses of the land by the agencies 
or entities to which the land will be transferred. 

In southern Santa Cruz County, 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 is known to occur at Sunset and Manresa State Beaches, and within the past few years, scattered occurrences were found
as far north as Day Valley (R. Morgan, pers. comm., 1991). Populations at Sunset State Beach 
possibly were inadvertently affected by trampling and the introduction 
of non-native species during dune stabilization projects. 
Populations of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

robusta

 in coastal dune and 
coastal scrub habitats were affected by residential development, 
recreational use, and the introduction of non-native species. 
Management plans for 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

robusta

 at Sunset State Beach are not yet developed. Sunset State Beach has the largest known 
population, numbering about 5,000 individuals in 1988 (CNDDB 1993). 
Smaller populations of a few hundred each near Manresa State Beach and 
on property owned by the city of Santa Cruz are not currently protected. 
The city will be developing a management plan to manage the property as 
a ``low impact'' park and intends to protect habitat for the plant (Ken 
Thomas, City of Santa Cruz, pers. comm., 1993). 

A patch of 300 individuals of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

robusta

 
that was reported in 1985 from Manresa State Beach could not be 
relocated in 1990 (CNDDB 1990). Efforts were started at Sunset State 
Beach to restore the native dune species by removing the introduced non- 
native species (Ferreira 1989). If the presence of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 
var. 

robusta

 is taken into consideration in areas targeted for such 
restoration, impacts to the plant may be avoided. 

Virtually the entire range of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 
occurs on three parcels, all in private ownership. Two parcels, 
totaling 282 acres, are currently proposed for a residential development 
and golf course named Glenwood Estates Development (City of Scotts 
Valley 1989). Surveys indicated that suitable habitat for 

C. robusta

 
var. 

hartwegii

 occupied 12 acres of the 282 acres of the two Glenwood 
Estates parcels, and 10 percent of this suitable habitat was occupied by 
the 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 (Habitat Restoration Group 1992). One other 116-acre parcel was planned for residential development, but the 
ownership was transferred to a software development and marketing firm 
that intends to establish world headquarters on the site. The firm 
indicated that the pending expansion of its global headquarters would 
affect less than 20 percent of the 116-acre parcel (Pat Welch, Borland 
Corporation, pers. comm., 1993). The firm expressed intention to set 
aside habitat for 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

, but since no legal 
protection currently exists for any of the known populations of the 
plant, 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 is threatened with the direct 
destruction of a portion of currently occupied habitat and with 
secondary impacts as discussed under Factor E. 

Historical and continuing threats to 

Erysimum teretifolium

 include 
the direct removal of habitat by sand quarrying and residential 
development. Alteration of habitat may also be occurring in the form of 
increased canopy density within the Ben Lomond sandhills as a result of 
fire suppression. Currently, the only population that is potentially 
protected is on the recently acquired Quail Hollow Ranch site; however, 
development of recreational facilities is proposed for a portion of the 
ranch (County of Santa Cruz 1990). The suppression of wildfires within 
the Santa Cruz mountains caused the density of woodland within the pine 
sandhill community to increase, which in turn may reduce the 
availability of suitable habitat for the plant (California Native Plant 
Society 1986).

The largest population of 

Erysimum teretifolium,

 located at the Quail Hollow Quarry, contains about 75 percent of the total number of known individuals of this species
(approximately 5,400 individuals) (Bittman 1986). This population was already reduced in size by sand quarrying,
and ongoing quarrying will likely continue to reduce the size of the population. A current proposal to expand mining
operations at this quarry would eliminate habitat supporting several hundred individuals of 

E. teretifolium,

 as well as an undetermined number of 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana

 (Strelow 1993). Of the remaining populations, none comprise over 400 individuals, and about half total less than
100 individuals each (Bittman 1986). Aside from the largest population, several of the smaller populations were
also reduced in size by quarrying, as well as by development of private lots. Occurrences of the plant were repeatedly
vandalized in the Bonny Doon area (California Native Plant Society 1986), apparently by landowners intent on developing
their properties. Quail Hollow Ranch, a site which supports less than 300 plants, was recently acquired as a park through
the joint efforts of The Nature Conservancy, Santa Cruz County, and the State of California. However, management
plans developed for the county portion of Quail Hollow Ranch may include development of recreational facilities,
which may affect 

E. teretifolium

 (County of Santa Cruz 1990).



B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.

 No evidence of collection for commercial, scientific, recreational, or educational purposes exists; however,
acts of vandalism have impacted 

Erysimum teretifolium

 and 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana.

 In addition, increased awareness of the need for protection of these species could increase the threat of vandalism
to these plants and their habitats.

At least one population of 

Erysimum teretifolium

 was destroyed by a private landowner during and shortly after the plant was processed for endangered status by CDFG
in 1981 (CNDDB 1992). Other occurrences of vandalism of this species were reported from a sand and gravel mine (Bittman
1986). A parcel of land owned by the San Lorenzo Valley Water District that supports several of the unique elements
of the Ben Lomond sandhills habitat, including 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

hartwegiana,

 was badly damaged by off-road vehicles despite efforts to fence off the area by the District.



C. Disease or predation.

 Two of three populations of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 were grazed by horses in Scotts Valley. No data exist to substantiate whether grazing threatens this plant. No information
exists concerning the threat of disease or predation to the other three plants.



D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 Under the Native Plant Protection Act (Division 2, Chapter 10, sec. 1900 

et seq.

 of the Fish and Game Code) and the California Endangered Species Act (Division 3, Chapter 1.5, sec. 2050 

et seq.

), the California Fish and Game Commission listed 

Erysimum teretifolium

 as endangered in 1981. Though both the Native Plant Protection Act and the California Endangered Species Act prohibit
the ``take'' of State-listed plants (Chapter 10, sec. 1908, and Chapter 1.5, sec. 2080), State law does not protect
the plants from taking via habitat modification or land use change by the landowner. After CDFG notifies a landowner
that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property, State law requires only that the landowner notify the agency
``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 10, sec. 1913). Although
these State laws provide a measure of protection to the species, these laws are not adequate to protect the species
in all cases. Numerous activities do not fall under the purview of this legislation, such as certain projects proposed
by the Federal government and projects falling under State statutory exemptions. Where overriding social and economic
considerations can be demonstrated, these laws allow project proposals to go forward, even in cases where the continued
existence of the species may be jeopardized or where adverse impacts are not mitigated to the point of insignificance.

The California Environmental Quality Act requires that environmental documents disclose the full scope of impacts
anticipated to sensitive resources within a project area. The initial documentation of a project in 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 habitat failed to include adequate information concerning the presence of and the potential impacts to this plant.
A lawsuit settlement required that additional surveys of occupied and suitable but unoccupied habitat for the plant
be completed (Jane Haines, Environmental Law Services, 

in litt.,

 1992). However, the lawsuit failed to specify that the information was to be used in redesigning the project to provide
adequate protection for the plant.

Part of the environmental review process under the California Environmental Quality Act for projects that result
in the loss of sites supporting these plant species generally includes the development of mitigation plans. Such
plans may involve establishing long-term protection for certain sites by designating them as ``reserves,'' enhancing
degraded sites to improve or extend suitable habitat, transplanting affected species to an off-site location, and/or
creating artificial habitat. Proponents for the Glenwood Estates Development proposed a mitigation plan that calls
for establishing reserves that would set aside 0.9 acre of habitat occupied by approximately 90 percent of the total
number of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 individuals, as well as an additional 6 acres of suitable but unoccupied habitat (APC International, Inc. 1992).
Although the project proponents have the intention of setting aside the largest concentrations, and therefore the
largest number of individuals of 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii,

 the distribution of this plant is already so restricted that any loss would be considered biologically significant.
A review of past mitigation measures applied to other species similar to 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 in their very narrow distributions have indicated that such measures failed to adequately effect long-term protection.
Frequently cited reasons include inadequate reserve size, inadequate buffer zones, and inappropriate adjacent
land uses that result in the disruption of ecological processes affecting soil and water conditions and pollinator
and seed disperser populations (Howald 1992). Furthermore, areas that currently support smaller concentrations
of this plant or areas of suitable habitat that are currently unoccupied by the plant would not be protected from habitat
alteration and would be lost for future recovery efforts.

Mitigation plans for State-listed species are typically formalized in a Mitigation Agreement between CDFG and the
project proponent. Although 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 is not currently State listed, CDFG attempted to secure a Mitigation Agreement because of its concern over the effects
of the project to the plant. However, CDFG was not able to reach an agreement with the Glenwood Development Company.
CDFG believes that the reserves, as delineated, will not be adequate to ensure long-term viability of the resources
targeted for protection. Furthermore, no compensation was offered for the loss of resources that will not be avoided
(Hunter, 

in litt.,

 1993).

The city of Scotts Valley has regulatory authority over 90 percent of the lands within the proposed project area. They
approved the project acknowledging that it would have unmitigable impacts to 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 by issuing a statement of overriding considerations. Although the California Environmental Quality Act process
allows for such approval, the goal of requiring mitigation that secures long-term protection for plants that qualify
for State listing has not been achieved. The Santa Cruz County Planning Commission, which has regulatory authority
over the remaining 10 percent of the lands within the proposed project area, recently rejected approval of the project.
This decision, however, is being appealed by the project proponent to the County Board of Supervisors.



E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 The introduction of non-native species to coastal dunes for the purpose of sand stabilization adversely affected
native dune flora, probably including 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

robusta

 and 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens.

 Such introduced species as European beach grass (

Ammophila arenaria

), sea-fig (

Carpobrotus

 ssp.), and iceplant (

Mesembryanthemum

 ssp.) invaded dune habitats and in many cases outcompeted the native flora. While public agencies are now aware of
the adverse impacts of introducing non-native species, efforts to restore dune habitats with native species may
also result in further impacts to sensitive plants, if not done properly.

As currently proposed, the Glenwood Estates Development would destroy numerous small colonies of 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii,

 but would set aside several reserves for the densest concentrations of the plant. These reserves would be left as small
islands within the golf course portion of the project. Grading of adjacent portions of the course may alter surface
and subsurface hydrologic processes of these remaining reserves. In addition, the reserves may be affected by the
application of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on the adjacent course. Application of such chemicals may
alter the balance of nutrients in the soil and may affect the ability of 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 to survive, either directly or through competition with exotic species that may be favored by application of these
chemicals (Edmondson 1987; Carl Wishner, botanist, pers. comm., 1993).

Typically, annuals and other monocarpic plants (individuals that die after flowering and fruiting), such as the
four plants that are the subject of this final rule, are vulnerable to random fluctuations or variation (stochasticity)
in annual weather patterns and other environmental factors (Huenneke 

et al.

 1986). All four of the plants are restricted to habitats of limited distribution within a small geographic range.
All but 

Chorizanthe pungens

 var. 

pungens

 are currently vulnerable to stochastic extinction due to their small and isolated populations. 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 and 

Chorizanthe robusta

 var. 

robusta

 are particularly threatened by this factor as 

C. robusta

 var. 

hartwegii

 is found on Santa Cruz mudstones and Purisima sandstones within a 1-mile diameter in Scotts Valley in the Santa Cruz
Mountains and 

C. robusta

 var. 

robusta

 is found in only three locations over a 12-mile range in southern Santa Cruz County.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
threats faced by these taxa in determining to make this rule final. 
Because three of the four plants are threatened by one or more of the 
following factors_urban and agricultural development, recreational 
use, sand mining, dune stabilization projects, or extinction from 
stochastic events_the preferred action is to list 

Chorizanthe pungens 


var. 

hartwegiana, Chorizanthe robusta 

(inclusive of vars. 

hartwegii 

and 


robusta

), and 

Erysimum teretifolium 

as endangered. Other alternatives 
to this action were considered but not preferred because not listing 
these species at all or listing these species as threatened would not 
provide adequate protection and would not be in keeping with the 
purposes of the Act. 



Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

is also threatened by the same 
factors listed above, as well as by ongoing military activities on the 
Fort Ord Army Base and its pending disposal. However, the wider range 
and greater number of populations and individuals of this species 
indicate that it is not now in danger of extinction throughout a 
significant portion of its range, as are the other three species, but is 
likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. Therefore, 
the preferred action is to list 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens 

as threatened. 
Not listing this species would not provide adequate protection and would 
not be in keeping with the purposes of the Act. For reasons discussed 
below, the Service is not designating critical habitat for these species 
at this time. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the 
maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate 
critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or 
threatened. Section 4(b)(6)(C) further indicates that a concurrent 
critical habitat designation is not required if the Service finds that a 
prompt determination of endangered or threatened status is essential to 
the conservation of the involved species or that critical habitat is not 
then determinable. The Service finds that designation of critical 
habitat for 

Chorizanthe robusta 

and 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

is 
prudent but presently not determinable and that designation of critical 
habitat for 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana 

and for 

Erysimum 
teretifolium 

is not prudent. 

The Service will propose designation of critical habitat for 
certain populations of 

Chorizanthe robusta 

and 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 


pungens 

that would likely not be imperiled by the threat of vandalism, 
collecting, or other human activities. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal 
agencies to insure that their activities are not likely to destroy or 
adversely modify critical habitat of a listed species. This stipulation 
for Federal agencies is in addition to the requirement to insure that 
their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of federally 
listed species. Therefore on lands where Federal actions, funding, 
authorizations, or licensing occurs, critical habitat would provide an 
added benefit to the conservation of these species. On non-Federal 
land, the designation of critical habitat may result in increased 
awareness of the need for protection. The designation of critical 
habitat could be useful for State landowners because they could use the 
designation to identify areas of special concern and to help establish 
priorities for their own land management. 

Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider 
economic and other impacts of designating a particular area as critical 
habitat. The Service must evaluate the effects of activities that occur 
within the ranges of these plants. The Service must gather data on 
precise habitat needs and ownership boundaries to be able to precisely 
define the critical habitat of these two plant taxa. In addition, the 
Service must analyze the economic impacts that could result from the 
designation of particular areas as critical habitat. Designation of 
critical habitat for 

Chorizanthe robusta 

and 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 


pungens 

is currently not determinable due to the need for this type of 
information. A proposal to designate critical habitat at this time 
would delay this final rule to list the species as threatened or 
endangered. The Service believes that a prompt determination of 
endangered or threatened status for these species is essential to ensure 
the benefits of conservation measures provided to species upon listing under the Act. Once the Service has gathered
the necessary data, it 
will publish a proposal to designate critical habitat for 

Chorizanthe 
robusta 

and 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens.

Each of the four plants face anthropogenic threats (see Factor A 
and Factor B in ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''), and many of 
the remaining populations of these species occur on privately owned 
property for which development is proposed or on which vandalism has 
already been noted. Due to the small number of populations of 

C. 
pungens 

var. 

hartwegiana 

and 

Erysimum teretifolium 

and the documented 
vandalism and proposed development of their habitats, the publication of 
precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 

Federal 
Register 

would make them more vulnerable to such incidents and could 
contribute to their decline. In addition, no known Federal action, 
authorization, licensing, or funding on these lands exist, hence a 
designation of critical habitat would provide no additional protection 
under section 7 of the Act. Therefore, it would not be prudent to 
designate critical habitat for these two species. The appropriate 
agencies and landowners can be notified of the locations and management 
needs of these plants. Protection of these populations will be 
addressed through the recovery process. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection,
and prohibitions 
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and 
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, 
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for 
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires 
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The 
protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against 
certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, 
below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that 
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or 
adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency 
must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 

Federal activities potentially impacting one or more of the four 
taxa include road and building construction projects and perhaps 
waterfowl management practices on Federal land. Populations of one of 
the four plants occur, at least in part, on Federal land. Fort Ord, 
which is managed by the Department of Defense, supports populations of 


Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 

pungens 

on the western and southern portion of 
the base. The Department of Defense indicated that closure and transfer 
of the base at Fort Ord will be phased over many years. Therefore, 
potential impacts to 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens 

as a result of the land 
transfer cannot be determined at this time. 

C. pungens 

var. 

pungens 

is 
also thought to occur on the Salinas River National Wildlife Refuge, 
which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; currently no 
activities occur on the Refuge that are known to affect the 

C. pungens 


var. 

pungens. 

Activities relating to the discharge of fill materials into waters 
of the United States and other special aquatic sites are regulated by 
section 404 of the Clean Water Act and may affect Chorizanthe pungens 


var. 

hartwegiana 

and 

Erysimum teretifolium 

where they occur adjacent to 
sand quarry operations. The pending proposal to develop the two 
Glenwood Estates parcels in Scotts Valley may also involve the discharge 
of fill materials. The Army Corps of Engineers would be required to 
consult with the Service on any section 404 permitting actions that may 
affect these species. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 
17.62, and 17.63 for endangered species and 17.71 and 17.71 for 
threatened species set forth a series of general prohibitions and 
exceptions that apply to all endangered or threatened plants. With 
respect to the four plant taxa that are the subject of this final rule, 
all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 
CFR 17.61 and 17.71, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it 
illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the 
course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale in interstate or 
foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession any such species 
from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimens 
of threatened plant species, in this case 

Chorizanthe pungens 

var. 


pungens, 

are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement of 
``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, for 
listed plants, the Act prohibits malicious damage or destruction of any 
such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction, and the removal, 
cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying any such species on any 
other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, or in 
the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain 
exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation 
agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the 
issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities 
involving endangered or threatened plant species under certain 
circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be 
sought or issued because the four plant species are not common in 
cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on 
plants and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the Office of 
Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 
North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-3507 (703/358-2104).
