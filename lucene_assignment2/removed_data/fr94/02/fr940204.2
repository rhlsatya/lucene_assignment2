This notice advises the public that APHIS has prepared a record of decision based on the final EIS. This record of decision
has been prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), 
(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384,
August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 
The Agency record of decision is set forth below. 


Record of Decision; Final Environmental Impact Statement; Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program 


Decision 


The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has prepared a final
environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program. The EIS analyzed alternatives
for eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), a serious pest of agriculture that may in the future infest
areas of the conterminous United States. After considering fully the analysis presented in the EIS (including supportive
documents cited or incorporated by reference), I have accepted the findings of the EIS. 
As described in the EIS, selection of an alternative (and associated control methods) for future Medfly programs
will be on an individual basis, made only after site-specific assessment of the individual program areas. The selection
of an alternative (and control methods) will consider the findings of the EIS, the site-specific assessment, the
public response, and any other relevant information available to APHIS at the time. APHIS will conduct environmental
monitoring, as described in ``Environmental Monitoring Plan, Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program'' (incorporated
by reference in this record of decision). I have determined that this course of action includes all practicable means
to avoid or minimize environmental harm from Medfly control measures that may be employed by APHIS in future cooperative
Medfly programs. 


Alternatives Considered 


The alternatives considered within the EIS include: No action, Medfly suppression (including chemicals), Medfly
suppression (no chemicals), Medfly eradication (including chemicals), and Medfly eradication (no chemicals).
They were broad in scope and reflect the major choices that must be made for a future program. The action alternatives
combined variously the use of control methods, also analyzed within the EIS. The control methods included chemical
control, nonchemical control, and combined control (including integrated pest management or IPM). They are limited
in scope and reflect the specific means by which the program objectives may be met. The EIS considered and compared
the potential impacts of the alternatives as well as their component control methods. 


Decisional Background 


In arriving at this decision, I have considered pertinent risk analyses, chemical background statements, a biological
assessment for endangered and threatened species, and other technical documents whose analyses and conclusions
were integrated into and summarized within the EIS. I have also considered APHIS' responsibilities under various
statutes or regulations, the technological feasibilities of the alternatives and control methods, and public perspectives
relative to environmental issues. Although scientific controversy may exist relative to the severity of potential
impacts, especially with regard to pesticide impacts, I am satisfied that APHIS has estimated correctly the impacts
of alternatives for Medfly eradication. 
APHIS understands the potential consequences of control methods (especially chemical methods) used for Medfly
eradication. Chemical control methods have greater potential for adverse environmental consequences than nonchemical
control methods. Chemical pesticides have the potential to adversely affect human health, nontarget species, and
physical components of the environment. APHIS fully appreciates the dangers pesticides may pose, especially to
sensitive members of communities. 
APHIS is committed to the rational use of chemical pesticides and strives to reduce their use wherever possible. However,
APHIS has statutory obligations that require it to act decisively to eliminate foreign pest species such as the Medfly.
Given the current state of control technology, we believe that nonchemical control methods (used exclusively) are
not capable of eradicating the Medfly. We know too that the net result of a decision not to use chemicals would be that
other government entities or commercial growers are likely to use even more chemicals over a wider area, with correspondingly
greater environmental impact. APHIS is convinced that, if eradication remains the objective, a coordinated and
well-run government program that limits the use of pesticides to the minimum necessary to do the job is therefore in
the best interests of the public and the environment. APHIS continues to support and favor the use of IPM strategies
in achieving Medfly eradication. 


Final Implementation 


In all cases, a site-specific assessment will be made prior to the time a decision is made on the control methods that
will be used on a particular program. The site-specific assessment will consider characteristics such as unique
and sensitive aspects of the program area, applicable environmental and program documentation, and applicable
new developments in environmental science or control technologies. The site-specific assessment will also confirm
the adequacy of or need for additional program mitigative measures. The site-specific analysis process is described
more fully in the EIS. Site-specific assessments will be made available to the public and APHIS will consider the public's
perspective relative to individual programs. 
To avoid or minimize environmental harm, APHIS will follow all standard operational procedures and program mitigative
measures developed for the Medfly Cooperative Eradication Program. These procedures (incorporated by reference
in this record of decision) are fully described in the EIS, and include but are not limited to the following: Pesticide
applicator certification, training and applicator orientation, special pesticide precautions for pesticide
application, identification of sensitive sites, public notification procedures, and interagency coordination
and consultation.

The petitions were submitted pursuant to section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm.
Any party having a substantial interest in the proceedings may request a public hearing on the matter. A request for
a hearing must be received by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Division, room 7023, Economic Development Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, no later than the close of business of the tenth calendar day following

ACTION: 

Notice and request for comments; request for monitoring of certain chrome-plated lug nuts from the Republic of Korea.







</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 13, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce received a request that the Secretary monitor imports of certain chrome-plated
lug nuts (``CPLNs''), from the Republic of Korea under section 732(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the
Act''), and  353.11(c) of the Department's regulations. The request was submitted by Consolidated International
Automotive, Inc. (``Consolidated''), the largest domestic producer of CPLNs, and applies to one-piece and two-piece
chrome-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, which are more than 11/16 inches (17.45 millimeters) in height and
which have a hexagonal (``hex'') size of at least three quarters of an inch (19.05 millimeters) but not greater than
one inch (25.4 millimeters). The term ``unfinished'' refers to unplated and/or unassembled chrome-plated lug nuts.
CPLNs are included under item number 7318.16.0010 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Consolidated requests that
the Secretary monitor imports of these products from the Republic of Korea, alleging that the circumstances which
allow the Department to monitor imports currently exist. Under section 732(a)(2) of the Act, the requirements for
the Secretary to monitor imports are: (a) More than one antidumping duty order for the same class or kind of merchandise
must be in effect; (b) the Department must have a reason to believe or suspect that there exists an extraordinary pattern
of persistent injurious dumping with respect to shipments from one or more additional supplier countries; and (c)
this extraordinary pattern of persistent injurious dumping is causing a serious commercial problem for the domestic
industry.





COMMENTS: 

Interested parties wishing to comment upon this request must send written comments not later than March 7, 1994. Comments
should be sent to the Secretary of Commerce, attention: Import Administration, Central Records Unit, room B-099,
U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Interested parties
may file replies to any comments submitted. All replies must be filed not later than 7 days after March 7, 1994. Any interested
parties submitting business proprietary information must do so in accordance with  353.32(b) of the Department's

Notice of 1994 inspection fees.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

NMFS announces changes in its fees and charges, effective January 1, 1994. However, since the regulations are being
amended to allow for review and revision of inspection fees and charges as needed, rather than annually as currently
written, the identified fees and charges will apply until further notice. NMFS is anticipating no further changes
in fees and charges until October 1994. The change in fees and charges represents an increase of 6.0 percent in the basic
hourly rates and results from higher operating costs such as salaries, transportation, and supplies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Regulations at 50 CFR 260.70 authorize the Secretary of Commerce to review and revise annually the rates for voluntary
fishery products inspection, grading, and certification services by publishing a notice of fee changes in the 

Federal Register

. The regulations are being amended to allow for review and revision of inspection fees and charges as needed, rather
than annually as currently written. Therefore, the identified fees and charges, effective January 1, 1994, will
apply until further notice. NMFS is anticipating no further changes in fees and charges until October 1994. The change
in fees and charges represents an increase of 6.0 percent in the basic hourly rates and results from higher operating
costs such as salaries, transportation, and supplies. 



Below is the schedule of fees effective January 1, 1994. The fees outlined for the State of Alaska are for services provided

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 10 and 17, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From 
People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 
FR 64932 and 65971) of proposed additions to the Procurement 
List. 



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the 
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the services 
to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the services. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the services to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the services proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following services are hereby added to the 
Procurement List:

 


Janitorial/Custodial 



Bldgs 433-437, 952-954, 956, 975, 980, 20140, 20202C,

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Theater Missile Defense Extended Test Range</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, Department of Defense.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) Extended Test Range proposal
is now available for review and comment. The DEIS has assessed potential impacts associated with conducting extended
range missile and sensor tests at four alternative test range areas. The TMD program would allow for the development
of a means to protect deployed U.S. forces, as well as U.S. friends and allies around the world, against attacks by short-
and medium-range ballistic, cruise, or air-to-surface missiles armed with conventional, nuclear, biological,
or chemical warheads.



These tests would consist of multiple demonstration and developmental missile launches along proposed flight paths
from off-range locations, with intercepts of targets over existing range areas or open sea areas located within and
outside of the United States. Surface-to-surface missile tests are also proposed. These flights are needed to validate
system design and operational effectiveness. 

The DEIS addresses, to the extent possible, the potential environmental impacts that would result from test site
modifications, launch preparation requirements, missile flights along the proposed flight paths, and intercepts
of targets over existing ranges or open sea areas. It also identifies any mitigation measures that could avoid or lessen
those impacts. Environmental resource topics evaluated include: air quality, airspace, noise, geology and soils,
water resources, socioeconomics, hazardous materials and waste, health and safety, land use, infrastructure and
transportation, and biological and cultural resources.




Lead agency: U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command

Cooperating agencies: Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, United States Air Force, United States Navy, Bureau
of Land Management, Federal Aviation Administration.




Proposed action: The proposed action is to conduct extended range tests of target missiles, defensive missiles,
and sensor systems at one or more of four test range areas. The tests would involve target and defensive missile launches
from existing test ranges and from off-range locations. Potential off-range launch locations may include land areas
and sea-based platforms. Missile-to-missile intercepts would occur over existing test range areas or over open
sea areas. Approximately 100 flight tests could occur during the period 1994 to 2000, from more than one off-range
location, and potentially from more than one test range area. Alternatives for conducting these missile flight tests
and intercepts, which are evaluated in the TMD Extended Test Range DEIS, are:

1. White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM. This alternative includes missile launches and sensor testing at WSMR and
Ft. Bliss, TX, with off-range missile launches from Ft. Wingate Depot Activity, NM, and the Green River Launch Complex,
UT.

2. Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), FL. This alternative includes missile launches and sensor testing at Eglin AFB on Santa
Rosa Island and at Cape San Blas, with off-range missile launches from a sea-based platform in the Gulf of Mexico.

3. The Western Range, CA. This alternative includes missile launches and sensor testing at Vandenberg AFB, San Nicolas
Island, and San Clemente Island, with off-range missile launches from a sea-based platform in the Pacific Ocean.

4. Kwajalein Missile Range (KMR), U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands. This alternative
includes missile launches and sensor testing at KMR and Wake Island with off-range missile launches from a sea-based
platform in the Pacific Ocean.

 Notice of inquiry and request for comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) is developing eligibility standards and funding criteria for the distribution of
DOE discretionary funds to federally-recognized American Indian tribes by DOE's Office of Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management (EM). Discretionary funds, pursuant to Section 646 of the DOE Organization Act, are awarded
to Indian tribes to participate in DOE's remediation and management program for wastes produced as the result of its
activities at its former and current weapons production facilities. Such participation relates directly to DOE's
American Indian Tribal Government policy, pursuant to DOE Order 1230.2, recognizing a government-to-government
relationship with Indian tribes. 



Because of the potential for broad interest, DOE is providing interested parties an opportunity for comment on issues
related to the funding of Indian tribes who are directly affected by DOE activities. DOE invites written comment on
the criteria development process before proposing guidelines. In addition, DOE will schedule public workshops
at several of its sites. Announcement of the location, date, and time of the public workshops will be published in the


Federal Register

. At these workshops, tribes and other interested parties will have an opportunity to further discuss issues related
to guidance.

II. Discussion_Eligibility and Funding Criteria 


A. Eligibility 


Eligibility criteria would determine if a federally-recognized Indian tribe qualifies to enter into a cooperative
agreement allowing tribal participation in DOE environmental remediation activities. The following considerations
could be used to determine tribal eligibility: 
(1) Should a tribe be considered eligible if its legal interests arising from treaty, statutes, and case law are affected
by a DOE hazardous waste site. 
(2) Should a tribe be considered eligible if its legal interests arising from treaty, statutes, and case law are affected
by a DOE produced waste stream or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes? 
(3) Should a tribe considered eligible if its cultural and natural resources are located on or in close proximity to
a DOE hazardous waste site, DOE produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes?
Please define cultural and natural resources. 
(4) Should a tribe be eligible if its reservation is located on or in close proximity to a DOE hazardous waste site, DOE
produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes? 
(5) Should ``close proximity'' be limited to a geographically defined area in relation to a DOE hazardous waste site,
DOE produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes (e.g., a geographic area
of not more than 50 miles, 100 miles, etc., from a hazardous site)? 
(6) Should ``close proximity'' be defined to include more distant areas where actual or likely physical harm could
occur as a result of a DOE hazardous waste site, DOE produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries
DOE hazardous wastes? 
(7) What other factors should be considered in determining eligibility? 



B. Funding 


Once it is ascertained which tribes are eligible to enter into cooperative agreements with DOE, the next determination
is what particular tribal activities should be funded and at what levels. The following considerations which could
be used to determine tribal funding include: 
(1) Should a priority system be used to categorize activities by factors such as the following: 
(a) The degree of the threat or actual level of harm to a tribe (e.g., the greater threat of harm, the greater the priority,
etc.); 
(b) Size of affected tribal population; and 
(c) Types of activities proposed, (e.g., a groundwater monitoring activity to ensure a safe drinking water supply
versus the remediation of a cultural site). 
(i) Should activities that support tribal management of cultural resources receive greater priority than other
activities? 
(ii) Should activities which would assist a tribe in becoming more economically competitive and self-sufficient
receive greater priority than other activities? 
(2) Should the fact that a tribe was previously funded by DOE mean it should receive greater consideration than a tribe
that has never been funded, or the opposite? 
(3) Should a tribe receive greater funding consideration for past participation in DOE activities that were well
performed by the tribe? 
(4) Where possible, should tribes that coordinate and prepare a joint proposal receive more favorable consideration
than proposals by individual tribes? 
(5) To what extent should proximity be taken into account in funding one tribe that can argue a greater degree of affectedness
over another tribe? ``Affected'' is defined in this instance to apply to a tribe that faces a substantial environmental
or health impact. 



III. Request for Submissions 


The criteria and other ideas raised in this Notice are suggestions for comment. Comments need not address all suggestions
raised in this inquiry and can be limited to particular points. DOE welcomes additional comments on eligibility and
funding criteria for Indian tribes. All written information provided by respondents will be available for public
inspection at the Department of Energy, Freedom of Information Reading Room, room 1E-190, 1000 Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, 20585, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11 (1983), any person submitting information believed to be confidential
and exempt by law from public disclosure should submit a copy of the document in which information believed to be confidential
has been deleted along with the confidential submissions. The Department of Energy will determine the confidential
status of the information and treat it accordingly.

Projects funded by the DOE Industrial Combustion Equipment Program are generally phased, but it is not required that
they be phased. Phase I typically involves an expansion of market and economic estimates based on those presented
in the proposal, the identification and finalization of host site arrangements, additional laboratory (bench scale)
or theoretical evaluation of the system proposed, and development of a business plan. Phase II typically encompasses
development, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a pilot scale unit. Additional economic evaluations are generally
conducted to assess commercial scale systems. Phase III typically encompasses the installation and testing of a
demonstration (proof-of-concept) scale unit at an industrial host facility. Tasks in more than one phase may be addressed
simultaneously. For the purpose of cost share determination, Phase I and Phase II tasks are considered to be research
and development while Phase III tasks are demonstration. The demonstration is designed to provide industry with
credible data to accelerate the adoption of new technology combustion equipment. A commercial product that improves
the efficiency, reduces emissions, and enhances the competitiveness of U.S. industry is expected to result from
each project. 



Project Description 



This solicitation is to promote new and advanced natural gas utilization technologies for the research, development
and demonstration of cost effective, very low emission industrial natural gas combustion equipment in intermediate
temperature applications which will improve efficiency and reduce emissions without the need for post-combustion
controls. This approach to emissions control reflects the view that it is substantially more economical to prevent
pollution than to eliminate it after it has been produced. This proposed technology may be a retrofit to existing systems
or may require totally new systems. A commercial end product is the main objective of each project funded by this solicitation.
Awardees will be required to prepare a business plan that illustrates how the equipment end product will be commercialized.


The proposed technology must meet the current EPA Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) NOx standards without add-on
emission controls such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). The NOx target value for intermediate temperature
range industrial combustion equipment for the purposes of this solicitation will be 9 ppm or less at 3% excess oxygen.
Not only are NOx emissions to be low, the emissions of other undesirable products of combustion are to be within EPA
specifications or low (if no source specifications have been promulgated) as well. Included are carbon monoxide
(CO), hydrocarbons, and air toxics. For the purpose of this solicitation the CO target value will be 50 ppm or less.
Regulations for air toxics and hydrocarbons have not yet been developed for the types of industrial boilers, furnaces,
etc, which are the subject of this solicitation. Additional information for air toxics and hydrocarbons is contained
in Title I and Title III of the 1990 CAAA. 

The focus of the project(s) to result from this solicitation is on natural gas combustion equipment with low emissions
production from intermediate temperature industrial combustion applications. For the purposes of this solicitation,
the intermediate temperature range includes process steam applications (all temperatures), direct heat, and process
fluid heating applications between 800
 F to 2000
 F. Examples of direct heating applications (but not limited by this list) include heat transfer from combustion
gasses to a heat sink such as used in metals processing, calcining, smelting, annealing, forging, and melting. Examples
of process fluid heating applications include petroleum refining, distillation, and oil loop heating. Internal
combustion engines, gas turbines and waste incinerator applications are excluded from this solicitation. It would
be advantageous if the equipment developed were applicable to more than one industry. 

All projects that are within the above project description are eligible for consideration under this solicitation.


Examples of possible projects include, but are not limited to: (1) Optimization of porous radiant burner heat transfer;
(2) catalytic combustion burner for furnaces and boilers; (3) inert porous media furnace/boiler, and; (4) precombustion
chamber burner for heavy oils which facilitate interruptible natural gas usage. Additional information will be
provided for these four technologies in a paper included in the pre-applicant package entitled, ``Very Low Emission
Industrial Combustion Equipment, Research and Development''. It is stressed, these are example projects only.


It is intended that during the demonstration phase, emissions are to be measured using a certified methodology by
an independent commercial emissions measurement company. If ``before and after'' measurements are warranted,
the above is to be used for both to assure the quality of the results obtained.

Award of Cooperative Agreements is anticipated. All projects shall be cost shared by DOE and the participant. Applicants
should be aware that any awardee shall be required to have a cost share of not less than 20% of the total cost of the program
for the research and development phases and 50% of the total cost of the program for the demonstration phase. 

Because of the interest of the natural gas industry in this solicitation, it is expected that segments of that industry
may make some cost share funds available to applicants for projects they consider to be beneficial to their segment
of the industry. The natural gas industry has typically supported the research, development and demonstration phases
of projects. The Industrial Gas Technology Commercialization Center (IGTCC), 1515 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22209,
has agreed to serve as a clearinghouse for channelling gas industry funding into projects. Applicants wishing to
be considered for natural gas industry support should contact David L. Sgrignoli, Executive Director (telephone
number 703-841-8561) at IGTCC before submitting proposals. It is suggested that bidders contact IGTCC
as early in the proposal preparation process as is practical. While the cost share requirements of EPAct must be met,
natural gas industry funding is NOT required to obtain DOE support. Likewise, natural gas industry funding will NOT
provide assurance of DOE support. 

No fee or profit will be paid to the award recipients. DOE anticipates that approximately $873,000 will be available
for support of activities during FY-94. It is anticipated that there will be one or more awards. Available funds
for future years is anticipated to be at the same or an increased level. 

Individual project duration will not exceed 5 years. Project(s) with durations of less than 5 years and in any phase
(I, II or III) of development are eligible, if conclusive evidence is presented that previous phase(s) have been completed
successfully. All applications with project periods of 5 years or less will be given equal consideration. Initial
awards will be for one year, with subsequent year extensions, contingent on available DOE funding. 
Applications shall contain a well defined research concept and plan; confirmed industrial partner participation
and support; and indicate satisfactory expertise, experience, capabilities, resources, and management of R&D
team personnel; and adequate facilities to perform the research including a potential host facility for demonstration
purposes. 

Selection is expected to be made in June 1994 and the earliest award is expected to be made in November 1994. 

Negotiation, award, and administration will be in accordance with DOE Financial Assistance Regulations (10 CFR
part 600). The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this program is 81.078. Profit making entities,
individuals, educational or nonprofit institutions, federal laboratories, and other entities, are eligible to
submit applications in response to this solicitation. OMB A-95 clearance is not required. Applications anticipating
participation of a federal laboratory through subcontract, use agreement, or other arrangement must include satisfactory
evidence of specific authorization from the cognizant federal agency. 

Notice of Possible Availability of Loans for Bid Proposal Preparation by Minority Business Enterprises seeking
DOE Contracts and Assistance (Section 211(e)(1) of the DOE Act Public Law 95-619 as amended by Public Law 95-619)
authorizes the DOE to provide financial assistance to minority business enterprises to assist them in their efforts
to participate in DOE acquisition and assistance programs. Financial assistance is in the form of direct loans to
enable the preparation of bids or proposals for DOE contracts and assistance awards, subcontracts with DOE operating
contractors, and contracts with subcontracts of DOE operating contractors. The loans are limited to 75% of the costs
involved. Availability of these loans is subject to annual appropriation of funds (and to the remaining availability
of funds from such appropriations under CFDA number 81.063). DOE does not warrant that such assistance can be made
available in sufficient time to prepare an application for this solicitation. DOE does point out that the program
includes provisions for a preliminary review in advance of a specific loan request. Information regarding loan availability,
eligibility criteria, and how to apply may be obtained from: San Francisco Field Office, USDOE, 1333 Broadway, Oakland,
California 94612, Attention: Minority Loan Program Office. Telephone (415) 273-6403.

3 has a maximum point value of 10. 





Criterion 1:

 Research Concept and Plan_Factors to be considered are the clarity, completeness, responsiveness, and adequacy
of the statement of work; the merit and depth of discussion of the proposed project (review of supporting data obtained
in laboratory and/or pilot scale work completed to date) to determine if the proposed work is new and advanced, is based
on sound scientific/engineering principles, improves efficiency and reduces natural gas combustion equipment
emissions significantly without post-combustion controls, and the general applicability, timeliness and potential
economic viability of the proposed technology; the planned levels of data acquisition, sampling and analyses; the
schedule (sequence of project tasks, principal milestones, decision points, and adequacy of time for each task);
and the planned assignment of responsibilities and level of manpower to complete the research. 





Criterion 2:

 Applicant/Team Capabilities_Factors to be considered for the applicant and industrial partner team personnel
are experience in research, development and demonstration of the project proposed; knowledge of past advanced developments
in the work proposed; resources to perform the research, development and demonstration of the work proposed; ability

the lower relative importance of the cost considerations, the evaluated cost may be the basis for selection. In making
the selection decision, the apparent advantages of individual technical and business applications will be weighed
against the probable cost to the government to determine whether the application approaches (excluding cost considerations)
are worth the probable cost differences. 



e. Selection: Applications will be evaluated under the Office of Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Merit
Review of Discretionary Financial Assistance Applications Review Procedures for Solicited Proposals. The Source
Selection Official (SO) will make the selection for negotiation and award in accordance with the above evaluation

<DOCTITLE>Eugene Water & Electric Board; Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and Conduct Public
Scoping Meetings </DOCTITLE>



January 27, 1994. 



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received 
an application for a new license for the Leaburg-Walterville 
Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 2496. The hydropower project is 
located on the McKenzie River in Oregon. 

The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project 
would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to 
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the 
hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act. 

The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific 
and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable 
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and 
engineering analysis. 

The draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all 
the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft will be 
analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's 
conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for 
consideration by the Commission in reaching a licensing decision. 



Scoping Meeting 



A project site visit for FERC staff, agencies and all other 
interested parties is scheduled for Tuesday, February 15, 1994. 
The site visit will commence at 9 a.m. at Water Board Park 
located adjacent to the Leaburg Dam, just off of Highway 126. The 
site visit will likely extend into the afternoon. The site visit 
will provide an opportunity for interested parties to observe 
environmental conditions in the project area. All those interested 
are encouraged to attend. 

The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. The evening 
scoping meeting is primarily for public input while the morning 
meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested 
individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend 
either or both sessions to assist the staff in identifying the 
scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. 

On the evening of Wednesday, February 16, 1994, we will hold 
the first scoping meeting, primarily for the public, from 7-10 p.m. at the Thurston High School Auditorium in
Springfield, 
Oregon. The high school is located just off Highway 126, at 333 
North 58th Street. 

The second scoping meeting, primarily for resource agencies, 
will be from 9:30 a.m.-12 p.m. the following morning, Thursday, 
February 17, 1994, at the Springfield Chamber of Commerce, Freight 
Room. The Springfield Chamber of Commerce is located on South A 
Street, between Mill Street and Pioneer Parkway West. 

To help focus discussions, a preliminary EIS scoping document 
(Scoping Document 1) outlining subject areas to be addressed at the 
meetings will be distributed by mail to parties on the FERC service 
list. Copies of Scoping Document 1 will also be available at the 
scoping meetings. 



Objectives 



At the scoping meetings the staff will: 

 Identify reasonable alternative measures that should be 
evaluated in the EIS; 

 Identify significant environmental issues related to the 
proposed project; 

 Determine the depth of analysis for issues addressed in 
the EIS; and 

 Identify resource issues that are not important and that 
do not require detailed analysis. 



Procedures 



The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and all 
statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal 
record of the Commission proceedings on the Leaburg-Walterville 
Project. Individuals presenting statements at the meeting will be 
asked to clearly identify themselves for the record. 

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental 
expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend either or both of 
the meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the 
issues to be addressed in the EIS. 

Concerned parties are encouraged to offer us verbal guidance 
during public meetings. Speaking time allowed for individuals will 
be determined before each meeting, based on the number of persons 
wishing to speak and the approximate amount of time available for 
the session, but all speakers will be provided at least five 
minutes to present their views. 

People choosing not to speak, but wishing to express an 
opinion, as well as speakers unable to summarize their positions 
within their allotted time, may submit written statements at the 
meeting for inclusion in the public record. 

Written scoping comments may also be filed with the Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street 
NE., Washington, DC 20426, until March 18, 1994. Filings by 
the applicant and intervenors should contain an original and eight 
copies. Other interested parties may file original comments 
without copies, but failure to file an original and eight copies 
may result in appropriate staff not receiving the benefit of your 
comments in a timely manner. See 18 CFR 4.34(h). 

All correspondence should clearly show the following caption 
on the first page:




Leaburg-Walterville Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 2496, Oregon




All those attending the meeting are urged to refrain from 
making any communication concerning the merits of the 
application(s) to any member of the Commission staff or the 
Commission's contractor outside of the established process for 
developing the record as stated above. Any such communications 
will be entered by staff into the record of the proceeding.

Further, interested persons are reminded of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring participants (as defined 
in 18 CFR 385.2010) filing documents with the Commission, to serve 
a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official 
service list for this proceeding. See 18 CFR 4.34(b).

<DOCTITLE>Colorado Interstate Gas Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



January 26, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Colorado Interstate Gas Company 



[Docket No. CP94-185-000] 



Take notice that on January 18, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), Post Office Box 1087, Colorado Springs,
Colorado 80944, filed in Docket No. CP94-185-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural
Gas Act for an order granting permission and approval to abandon the transportation and exchange of natural gas, all
as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

CIG states that it proposes to abandon a certificated agreement related to the transportation and exchange of natural
gas by CIG for Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia). CIG further states that the agreement, dated June
2, 1980, as amended, constitutes CIG's Rate Schedule X-67 of its FERC Gas Tariff, Original Volume No. 2. 

CIG says that Columbia has requested that CIG terminate the agreement as a result of Order No. 636. Columbia will not
engage in the merchant function as of November 1, 1993, and consequently will no longer require the transportation
service, it is stated. 

CIG further states that it does not propose to abandon any facilities as a result of the authorization requested. 



Comment date:

 February 16, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Colorado Interstate Gas Company 



[Docket No. CP94-186-000]



Take notice that on January 14, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), Post Office Box 1087, Colorado Springs,
Colorado 80944, filed in Docket No. CP94-186-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural
Gas Act for an order granting permission and approval to abandon the transportation of natural gas, all as more fully
set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

CIG states that it proposes to abandon the Transportation Agreement (Agreement) with Sinclair Oil Corporation (Sinclair)
pursuant to CIG's Rate Schedule X-41 of its FERC Gas Tariff, Original Volume No. 2. CIG further states that this
rate schedule provides that CIG may transport gas produced from reserves owned by Sinclair in the Blue Gap and West
Creston areas of Carbon County, Wyoming to Sinclair's refineries. Sinclair has advised CIG that they have sold the
properties from which it has in the past several years transported gas to CIG under the referenced transportation
agreement and the Agreement is no longer useful to Sinclair, it is stated. 

CIG says that it does not propose to abandon any facilities as a result of the authorization requested. 



Comment date:

 February 16, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



3. Colorado Interstate Gas Company 



[Docket No. CP94-187-000] 



Take notice that on January 14, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O. Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado
80944, filed in Docket No. CP94-187-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon an injection/withdrawal well, which was authorized in Docket No. CP92-154-000,


et al

., all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

CIG proposes to abandon the Latigo No. 46 well as an injection/withdrawal well and to convert it to an observation well.
It is stated that the well is located in the Latigo Storage Field in eastern Colorado. It is asserted that the well is
not functioning adequately as an injection/withdrawal well 
at this time and would be more useful as an observation well to monitor reservoir pressures and the movement of gas.




Comment date:

 February 16, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

4. CNG Transmission Corporation



[Docket No. CP94-189-000] 



Take notice that on January 14, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West
Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP94-189-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct
a new sales/transportation tap and appurtenant facilities to serve as a delivery point to Kamine/Besicorp Allegany,
L.P. (Kamine Allegany) for the transportation of 11,100 Dekatherms (Dt) per day of natural gas for use in its 55 Megawatt
Cogeneration Plant located in the Town of Hume, New York, under CNG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-537-000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

It is stated that Kamine Allegany is constructing a 55 Megawatt gas-fired cogeneration plant in the Town of Hume, New
York. It is further stated that Kamine Allegany's plant will cogenerate steam that will be used by an adjacent greenhouse,
and electricity that will be purchased by Rochester Gas and Electric Company. 

CNG states that Kamine Allegany has made arrangements to transport its 11,100 Dt per day that it needs to fire its cogeneration
plant on CNG's interstate pipeline system. In order to deliver Kamine Allegany's gas to the cogeneration plant, CNG
must construct a tap, measuring and regulation station, and about 600 feet of 6 inch connecting pipeline. Therefore,
CNG is proposing herein to tap into its existing parallel Lines 14 & 24, construct about 600 feet of connecting
pipeline to connect with the Kamine Allegany Cogeneration plant, and install a measuring and regulation station,
along with various auxiliary installations (gate valve assembly, a filter/separator, a line heater, various valves
and yard and station piping, and buildings) at the point of interconnection with Lines 14 & 24. 

The estimated cost of the construction here is $600,000. 

 

Additionally, CNG states that it has sufficient system delivery capacity to deliver the existing contract quantities
without disadvantaging its existing customers, either sales or transportation. These deliveries to Kamine Allegany
for its cogeneration plant will have a 

de minimus

 impact on CNG's system wide peak and annual deliveries, CNG states. CNG verifies that 
the proposed construction complies with the requirements of Subpart F of Part 157 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act. 



Comment date:

 March 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.

Environmental Impact Statements and Regulations; Availability of EPA Comments 



Availability of EPA comments prepared 
January 17, 1994 through January 21, 1994 
pursuant to the Environmental Review 
Process (ERP), under Section 309 of the 
Clean Air Act and Section 102(2)(c) of 
the National Environmental Policy Act 
as amended. Requests for copies of EPA 
comments can be directed to the Office of 
Federal Activities at (202) 260-5076. 

An explanation of the ratings assigned to 
draft environmental impact statements 
(EISs) was published in FR dated 
April 10, 1993 (58 FR 18392). 



Draft EISs 


ERP No. D-AFS-K67021-NV Rating EC2, 
Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine Expansion Project, 
Implementation, Plan of Operation and COE Section 
404 Permit, Humboldt National Forest, Mountain 
City Ranger District, Elko County, NV. 


Summary: 

EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding the 
proposed alternative due to potential impacts to water 
quality, water quantity, air quality and vegetation. 
EPA recommended that the final EIS provide additional 
information on these issues as well as cumulative 
impacts and wetlands mitigation. 
ERP No. D-FRA-B53010-00 Rating LO1, 
Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, 
Implementation, Electrification of the Rail Main Line 
from New Haven to Boston, Funding, COE Section 10 
and 404 Permits, New Haven, CT and Boston, MA. 


Summary:

 EPA stated that the proposed project had the 
potential to improve region air quality and that other 
environmental resources within EPA's jurisdiction and 
expertise would not be significantly adversely 
affected by the proposed project. 
ERP No. DC-FHW-B40050-MA Rating EC2, 
Central Artery/I-93 Third Harbor Tunnel/I-90 
Extension, Updated and Additional Information, 
Design Alternatives for the Charles River 
Crossing, Funding, US COE Section 10 and 404 
Permits, US CGD Permits and EPA NPDES Permit, 
Suffolk County, MA. 


Summary:

 EPA expressed environmental concerns for Clean Air Act 
conformity requirements to be addressed, and the 
analysis of shading impacts and compensatory mitigation 
for adverse environmental impacts to waters of the 
United States. EPA commented that all three new 
design alternatives presented in the draft supplemental 
EIS would have less adverse environmental impact, and 
less adverse impact on parks and open space, than the 
alternative (Scheme Z) presented in the 1991 final 
supplemental EIS as the proposed action. 
ERP No. DS-AFS-K65136-CA Rating LO, 
Casa-Guard Timber Sale, Timber Harvesting, Updated 
Information concerning Impacts on the California 
Spotted Owl and Fish Creek Watershed and 
Reforestation, Sequoia National Forest, Cannell 
Meadow Ranger District, Tulare County, CA. 


Summary:

 EPA expressed lack of objections with the proposed 
action. 
ERP No. DS-AFS-K65137-CA Rating LO, 
Cottonwood and Gulf Timber Sales, Timber 
Harvesting in the Breckenridge Compartment, 
Updated Information Concerning Withdrawal of the 
Golf Timber Sale and Impacts on the California 
Spotted Owl and Reforestation for the Cottonwood 
Timber Sale, Sequoia National Forest, Greenhorn 
Ranger District, Kern County, CA. 


Summary:

 EPA expressed lack of objections with the proposed action. 


Final EISs 


No. F-COE-B40062-NH, 
Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway 
Improvements, Approval and COE Section 10 and 404 
Permits, Towns of Hudson, Nashua and Litchfield, 
Hillsborough County, NH. 


Summary:

 EPA had environmental objections to the proposed 
action due to (1) significant degradation of waters of 
the United States, including wetlands; (2) potential 
adverse impacts to water supply resources; and (3) the 
lack of specific mitigation to offset the impacts to 
waters of the U.S. and drinking water supplies. EPA 
stated that the proposed action is a likely candidate 
for action under EPA's Section 404 (c) authority 
and recommended that the Corps of Engineers deny 
the Section 404 permit application.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>



January 28, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-0276. Persons wishing
to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.






OMB Number:

 3060-0207



Title:

 Sections 73.961 and 73.932, Test of the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and Radio Monitoring and Attention Signal
Transmission Requirements



Action:

 Extension of currently approved collection



Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses)



Frequency of Response:

 Recordkeeping requirement



Estimated Annual Burden:

 12,500 recordkeepers; 1.25 hours average burden per recordkeeper; 15,625 hours total annual burden



Needs and Uses:

 Section 73.961 requires that all broadcast stations log transmission and receipt of the weekly EBS test and receipt
of the semi-monthly wire service test. The recordkeeping of this information is necessary to document station compliance
with this rule and to help enhance station awareness and participation in the National, State and Local Emergency
Broadcast System. Section 73.932 further explains rule 73.961 and requires broadcast stations to log why they did
not receive a weekly EBS test. The information is used by FCC staff as part of their routine inspections of broadcast
stations. Accurate recordkeeping of this data is vital in determining the location and nature of possible equipment
failure on the part of the transmitting or receiving station (or wire service). Furthermore, since the National level
EBS is solely for the use of the President, its proper operation must be assured.



OMB Number:

 3060-0465



Title:

 Section 74.985, Signal booster stations



Action:

 Extension of a currently approved collection 



Respondents:

 Non-profit institutions and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses)



Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement



Estimated Annual Burden: 

27 responses; .78 hour average burden per response; 21 hours total annual burden



Needs and Uses:

 On 2/21/91, the OMB approved an information collection for 47 CFR 74.985(a) under OMB Control Number 3060-0465.
On 1/21/92, OMB approved an information collection for Amendment of parts 21, 43, 74, 78 and 94 of the Commission's
rules Governing Use of the Frequencies in the 2.1 and 2.5 GHz Bands Affecting Private Operational-Fixed Microwave
under OMB Control Number 3060-0464. This information collection includes  74.985 (b), (c) and (g) amongst
other rules. On 2/13/93, the Commission adopted a Report and Order in PR Docket No. 92-80, which further modified
 74.985(g). On 10/30/93, OMB approved this modification through a correction worksheet (3060-0464).



In this submission, we are bringing all portions of  74.985 under one OMB control number. All other portions
of the approval for OMB Control Number 3060-0464 will remain under that collection. Section 74.985(a) requires
signal booster stations to obtain the written consent from the licensee of the MDS, MMDS, or ITFS station whose signals
are to be retransmitted. Section 74.985 (b), (c), and (d) are reporting requirements that are contained in the FCC
Form 330 and will not be included as a separate burden within this rule section. Section 74.985(e) requires each application
for a signal booster station to include a written consent statement of the licensee of each MDS, MMDS, and ITFS station
whose signal is retransmitted. Section 74.985(g) requires that a MDS or ITFS licensee submit a certification statement
to install a low power signal booster within 48 hours of installation of the booster station. Such applications must
demonstrate compliance with 74.985(g). This written consent would be attached to an application for signal booster
station and would be used by FCC staff to ensure that a booster station has consent to retransmit the MDS, MMDS, and ITFS
station signal. The requirements in  74.985(g) would be used by FCC staff to ensure that a low power signal booster
would not cause interference and that it has proper authority to retransmit an MDS or ITFS signal.

<DOCTITLE>Comments Invited on Florida Public Safety Plan Amendment</DOCTITLE>



January 26, 1994.



On May 10, 1990, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Florida (Region 9). On October 25, 1993, Region
9 submitted a proposed amendment to its plan that would, in part, add an additional subregion, clarify timeframes
for applications for pooled and dedicated channel allotments, add explicit channel loading requirements, and clarify
and enlarge upon mutual aid requirements. Because the proposed amendment is a major change to the Region 9 plan, the
Commission is soliciting comments from the public before taking action. (See Report and Order, General Docket No.
87-112, 3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.)

Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before March 4, 1994 and reply comments on or before
March 21, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554 and should clearly identify them as submissions to Gen. Docket 90-119 Florida-Public
Safety Region 9.

Questions regarding this public notice may be directed to Betty Woolford, Private Radio Bureau, (202) 632-6497
or Ray LaForge, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653-8112.

California; Amendment to Notice of a Major Disaster Declaration



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice amends the notice of a major disaster for the State of California, (FEMA-1008-DR), dated January
17, 1994, and related determinations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated January 25, 1994, the President amended the cost-sharing arrangements
concerning Federal funds provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq

.), in a letter to James L. Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as follows:





I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks
on January 17, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude that special cost-sharing conditions
are warranted under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act'') for
the Public Assistance program.

Therefore, I amend my previous declaration to authorize Federal funds for Public Assistance at 90 percent of total
eligible costs, except for direct Federal assistance costs for emergency work, which are authorized at 100 percent
Federal funding until January 25, 1994. This 90 percent reimbursement applies to all authorized Public Assistance
costs.

This adjustment to State and local cost sharing applies only to Public Assistance costs eligible for such adjustment
under the law. The law specifically prohibits a similar adjustment for funds provided to States for the Individual
and Family Grant program. These funds will continue to be reimbursed at 75 percent of total eligible costs.

Please notify the Governor of the State of California and the Federal Coordinating Officer of this amendment to my
major disaster declaration.

<DOCTITLE>Albuquerque Substance Abuse Clinic; Denial of Hearing and Revocation of Approval of a Narcotic Addiction Treatment
Program; Final Order </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revoking approval of an ``Application for Approval of Use of Methadone in
a Treatment Program'' (Form FDA-2632) held by Albuquerque Substance Abuse Clinic, Inc. (ASAC). The sponsor
has failed to demonstrate the ability to correct and prevent violations of FDA's methadone regulation. Also, FDA
is denying ASAC~'s request for hearing because they failed to submit information showing that there is a genuine issue
of fact to justify a hearing. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49519), FDA published a notice of opportunity for a hearing (NOOH) proposing to revoke
approval of ASAC's Form FDA-2632 because of recurring, egregious violations of FDA's methadone regulation
in  291.505 (21 CFR 291.505). The September 23, 1993, NOOH: (1) Set forth in detail the specific violations found
in three FDA inspections conducted between April 2, 1991, and September 11, 1992; (2) described FDA's two unsuccessful
efforts to arrange an informal conference to allow ASAC the opportunity to explain why the program's approval should
not be revoked; and (3) offered ASAC the opportunity for a hearing on the proposal to revoke approval. 


By letter dated October 19, 1993, ASAC submitted a written notice of appearance and request for a hearing, but they
failed to submit the information and analyses to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of fact to justify a hearing.

FDA's Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs has reviewed ASAC's notice of appearance and request for a hearing,
as well as the data on file with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23,
12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, submitted by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in support of the
NOOH, and concludes that ASAC has failed to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing under
 314.200 (21 CFR 314.200), and that summary judgment should be entered against ASAC. The reasons for this decision
are set forth in section II of this document. 


I. Legislative and Regulatory Background 


Under the Controlled Substances Act (Pub. L. 91-513) (21 U.S.C. 801 

et seq

.), methadone is classified as a schedule II controlled substance (21 U.S.C. 812(c)). A schedule II classification
means that methadone is regarded to have a currently accepted medical use, but it has a high potential for abuse that
may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence (21 U.S.C. 812(b)). 
Methadone is a synthetic narcotic analgesic and has been approved by FDA for: (1) Relief of severe pain, (2) detoxification
treatment of narcotic addiction, and (3) temporary maintenance treatment of narcotic addiction. As discussed in
this section, the use of methadone for maintenance treatment of narcotic addiction is permitted to be used only by
approved methadone programs, i.e., programs found to be in accord with the conditions for distribution and use of
methadone set forth in  291.505. The reason for this restriction is methadone's potential for abuse and diversion
from legitimate commerce into the illegal marketplace. 
The current action revoking approval of a methadone program's Form FDA-2632 is the first such action FDA has
taken in more than 20 years of regulating methadone programs. The following discussion is intended to provide the
legislative and regulatory history underlying this action, so that the serious nature of ASAC's violations, and
FDA's response to them, are clearly understood. 
The current system by which FDA regulates and monitors the use of methadone in the treatment of addiction began in 1970
with passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (the CDAPCA) (Pub. L. 91-513)
(21 U.S.C. 801 

et seq.

). Prior to the CDAPCA, FDA's control over methadone was based exclusively on FDA's regulation of new drugs, including
the investigational use of new drugs, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C.
355). 
The CDAPCA directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the appropriate methods of professional
practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts (42 U.S.C. 257a).
The Secretary's authority to determine the safety and effectiveness of drugs or to approve new drugs to be used in the
treatment of narcotic addicts is delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs ( 5.10(a)(8) (21 CFR 5.10(a)(8))).
Practitioners who wish to prescribe or dispense controlled drugs, including methadone, are required under the CDAPCA
to register annually with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). 
In the 

Federal Register

 of April 2, 1971 (36 FR 6075), FDA published guidelines for investigating the use of methadone in maintenance treatment.
The purpose of these guidelines was to assure the availability of valid data on the use of methadone in maintenance
treatment and to protect the community from the hazards of diversion and abuse of methadone. 
It was FDA's position that restricting the use of methadone in maintenance treatment only under investigational
new drug application (IND) protocols was not warranted and that methadone should be available to all addicts who consent
to use it in approved treatment programs. On the other hand, FDA was aware that, despite the distribution restriction
of the IND protocols then in effect, the use of methadone outside IND protocols was substantial. FDA was concerned
that the usual form of new drug application (NDA) approval would lead to even greater diversion or misuse of the drug,
because it would permit relatively unrestricted distribution and allow all physicians wide discretion in prescribing
the drug. Therefore, FDA exercised its authority under both the IND and NDA control mechanisms, as well as the authority
granted under the CDAPCA, to ensure that the required information for assessing the safety and efficacy of methadone
would be obtained, and close control would be maintained over the distribution, administration, and dispensing
of the drug. 
In 1972, FDA issued its methadone regulations under the new drug provisions of section 505 of the act and the CDAPCA.
These regulations set forth medical standards in the treatment of narcotic addiction in accord with the CDAPCA and
provided for a closed system of methadone distribution. 
In the early 1970's, diversion of methadone from legitimate commerce into the illegal marketplace became a serious
problem. The authority of DEA to impose and enforce standards relating to the security and diversion of narcotic drugs
used in the treatment of narcotic addiction was strengthened in 1974 when Congress enacted the Narcotic Addict Treatment
Act of 1974 (the NATA) (Pub. L. 93-281) (21 U.S.C. note). The NATA ensured that only bona fide narcotic addicts
were admitted to maintenance or detoxification treatment, that they received quality care, and that illicit diversion
was limited. 
Under the NATA, those practitioners who dispense narcotic drugs in the treatment of narcotic-dependent persons
must obtain an annual registration with DEA. This registration is distinct from the general registration requirement,
previously mentioned, under the CDAPCA to prescribe or dispense controlled drugs. To be registered, these practitioners
must comply with the requirements established by DEA for secure drug storage, recordkeeping, and unsupervised use;
and these practitioners must be found qualified under the treatment standards established by FDA's methadone regulation
to engage in such treatment (21 U.S.C. 823(g)). 
In the 

Federal Register

 of September 19, 1980 (45 FR 62694), FDA and the National Institute of Drug Abuse jointly issued a final rule amending
FDA's methadone regulation to make it consistent with the requirements of the NATA and the implementing regulations
issued by DEA. Changes included requirements for physiologic dependence of patients, physician staffing, and urine
testing in methadone maintenance programs, more flexibility in clinical standards, clarification of patient care
responsibilities by indicating the minimum standards for the appropriate methods of professional practice in the
medical treatment of narcotic addicts, and recommendations regarding sound medical practice in the safe and effective
treatment of narcotic addicts with methadone. 


II. ASAC's Hearing Request and FDA's Finding 


ASAC, 117 Quincy St. NE., Albuquerque, NM 87124, is a substance abuse treatment clinic; one of its primary functions
is the dispensing of methadone hydrochloride in the treatment of narcotic addiction (heroin or other morphine-like
drugs). 
The NOOH proposing to revoke approval of ASAC's Form FDA-2632 set forth in detail a long list of serious violations
of FDA's methadone regulation. These violations have continued to recur over an extended period of time. ASAC has
shown an inability to function in accord with the methadone regulation. 
The fact that ASAC was unable to bring itself in compliance with the methadone regulation after multiple inspections
is clear evidence that the management of ASAC is not suited to run a narcotic treatment center using methadone. Moreover,
since publication of the NOOH, FDA has become aware that ASAC no longer has a medical director. A narcotic treatment
center using methadone treatment cannot legally function without a medical director. (See, inter alia,  291.505(c)
and (d)(4)(ii).) 
ASAC's entire hearing request consists of the following statement, dated October 19, 1993: 


 This letter is being sent to request a hearing for [ASAC] that we may show why our approval for a narcotic treatment program
should not be revoked. 
 We are gathering together all information and data showing just cause for us to remain open. We are in hopes this data
will demonstrate our ability to correct and prevent violations. 
The information will follow within the next thirty days. 
We are sincerely hoping you will accept and allow our request for the hearing. 


ASAC did not submit any additional information, and the request itself is nothing more than a notice of appearance.
As stated in the NOOH, a hearing request must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact that
requires a hearing. ASAC has failed even to attempt to submit such information. 
Therefore, for the reasons stated in the September 23, 1993, NOOH, and the reasons discussed in this final order, the
Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs hereby enters summary judgment against ASAC and revokes approval
of ASAC's ``Application for Approval of Use of Methadone in a Treatment Program'' (Form FDA-2632), effective
February 4, 1994. DEA and the New Mexico State authority are notified, concurrently with the issuance of this notice,
that the Associate Commissioner has determined that ASAC is not qualified to engage in the treatment with respect
to which registration under section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 823) was previously granted.
This notice is issued under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs ( 5.10 (a)(9)) and redelegated
to the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs (21 CFR 5.20).

General function of the board.

 The board provides advice primarily to the agency's Senior Science Advisor and, as needed, to the Commissioner and
other appropriate officials on specific complex and technical issues as well as emerging issues within the scientific
community in industry and academia. Additionally, the board provides advice to the agency on keeping pace with technical
and scientific evolutions in the fields of regulatory science; on formulating an appropriate research agenda; and
on upgrading its scientific and research facilities to keep pace with these changes. It also provides a means for critical
review of agency-sponsored intramural and extramural scientific research programs.


Agenda_Open public hearing.

 Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the board.
Those desiring to make formal presentations must notify the contact person before February 14, 1994, and submit a
brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of
proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time required to make their comments. Each presenter
will be limited in time and not all requests to speak may be able to be accommodated. All written statements submitted
by February 14, 1994, will be provided to the board.


Open board discussion.

 The board will discuss both academic and industrial external interactions. These discussions are designed to enhance
the scientific effectiveness of the agency.


Closed board deliberations.

 The board may discuss matters that would disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information obtained
from a person that is privileged or confidential. This portion of the meeting will be closed to permit discussion of
this information (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4)).
Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement To Allow Incidental
Take of the Threatened Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) Under Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species
Act and Notice of Public Meetings 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting and intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife (Service) intends to prepare an draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for incidental
take of desert tortoises pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).
A habitat conservation plan (HCP) will be prepared by the applicants. The applicants are Clark County and the cities
of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, Mesquite, and Boulder City, Nevada. The Service is initiating the scoping
process for preparing the DEIS. Major concerns include the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects that issuance
of the proposed permit would have on the desert tortoise and other fish and wildlife resources. This notice is being
provided as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) (40 CFR 1501.7).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


The Service issued a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit to allow incidental take of no more than 3,710 desert tortoises from
approximately 22,350 acres in the Las Vegas Valley on August 24, 1994. The permit and HCP are short-term, and will be
in effect through July 31, 1994, unless the permit is reissued under a long-term HCP.
The Service proposes to prepare a DEIS to evaluate the impacts from issuing a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) for
incidental take of desert tortoises due to development of the area addressed by the long-term Clark County Desert
Tortoise HCP. The term ``take'' is herein used as defined in the Act and its implementing regulations as: To harass,
harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect a listed species of fish or wildlife, or attempt
to engage in any such conduct. ``Harm'' is further defined to include significant habitat modification or degradation
that results in death or injury to listed species by significantly impairing behavioral patterns such as breeding,
feeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3). ``Harass'' is defined as actions that create the likelihood of injury to listed
species to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavior patterns which include, but are not limited
to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3).
Urban development in areas occupied by desert tortoises has created conflict situations in the Las Vegas Valley.
Much of the private land which would be covered by the long-term HCP cannot be developed due to the prohibitions of section
9 of the Act. In order for many planned development projects to proceed in compliance with the Act, a permit for incidental
take must be obtained. The decision by the Service to issue the incidental take permit is a Federal agency action that
must be considered in an environmental document pursuant to the NEPA. The Service has determined that an EIS should
be prepared because the proposed action may be a major Federal action and may have potential effects on the human environment.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940204-2-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940204-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Three alternatives may be considered in preparation of the EIS. The first proposed alternative is the issuance of
the proposed incidental take permit to include all planned development in the area. This alternative would include
a regional HCP that, when implemented, would provide for the long-term management of desert tortoises and tortoise
habitat found primarily on public lands. Implementation of this alternative would require an expenditure of funds
and resources to manage large blocks of desert tortoise habitat on public lands. Certain public lands would be managed
under the terms of a regional HCP for protection and recovery of desert tortoises; other multipurpose land-use activities
would be coordinated around this primary purpose. Within the area, urban development would be allowed to proceed
on private lands within the guidelines of the issued section 10(a)(1)(B) permit, HCP, and local ordinances.


The second alternative under consideration would include the preparation of a multispecies Clark County HCP. Under
this alternative, Clark County would prepare an HCP for all threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the
county. This approach would cover a broader range of species than the Clark County Desert Tortoise HCP. It must be to
section 10(a)(1)(B) standards.


As required by NEPA, a ``no action'' alternative is being considered. Under this alternative, an incidental take
permit would not be issued. A long-term regional HCP would not be completed or approved by the Service and take of desert
tortoises would be prohibited after July 31, 1994, when the short-term HCP expires for covered portions of the Las
Vegas Valley. Development would be restricted to those activities that would not result in take of desert tortoises.
A separate incidental take permit would be required for each development project that would impact desert tortoises.



Public Comments Solicited


To insure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are identified and addressed, comments and suggestions
are invited from all interested parties. The Service will consider all comments received by March 7, 1994, in preparation
of the EIS.


Authority



The authorities for this action are NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4371 

et seq.

; 40 CFR part 1500-1508).

Availability of Record of Decision (ROD) for the Dark Canyon Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the ROD for the Final Dark Canyon EIS.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), New Mexico State Office, announces the availability to the public of the ROD for
the Final Dark Canyon EIS. The Final Dark Canyon EIS analyzes the impacts on the environment from reasonable foreseeable
development of oil and gas resources within Dark Canyon, located in Eddy County, NM. The EIS analyzes seven alternatives,
including the no action alternative and the Applicant's (Yates Energy Corporation) proposed action to drill the
Diamondback Federal 

#

1 Well on Federal Lease NM-62161.


The ROD documents the Bureau's decision to select Alternative G (the Preferred Alternative) of the Final EIS. The
Decision approves the Applicant's proposed Diamondback Federal 

#

1 Well, with the location moved 300 meters to the northeast and establishes a ``Cave Protection Zone'' (CPZ) within
the EIS Study Area that would prohibit surface occupancy on existing leases. Drilling would be allowed within the
EIS Study Area, but outside the CPZ, with enhanced precautionary operations. Future leasing would be denied within
the EIS Study Area. By Memorandum of August 13, 1993, the National Park Service (NPS) concurred with the BLM in the selection
of the agency's Preferred Alternative.
The Dark Canyon EIS Study Area encompasses approximately 8,320 acres and lies about 20 miles southwest of the city
of Carlsbad, NM. The EIS Study Area is in the BLM's Carlsbad Resource Area and totally encompasses the Dark Canyon Special
Management Area, noted for its rugged and scenic landscape as well as cave resources.
The BLM was the lead agency for preparation of the EIS, because the BLM is responsible for permitting oil and gas exploration
on federal mineral estate. The NPS, Southwest Region, was a cooperating agency for preparation of the EIS because
the Study Area borders Carlsbad Caverns National Park to the south, and because the alternatives described in the
EIS could affect NPS cave resources, particularly Lechuguilla Cave.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Draft Dark Canyon EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and released for public review
on September 18, 1992. A formal public hearing was held on the Draft EIS to receive oral and written comments on the adequacy
of the Draft EIS and the merits of the alternatives discussed in Carlsbad, NM, on October 22, 1992. The public comment
period for the Draft EIS closed on November 20, 1992. The Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS was published in the


Federal Register

 on September 18, 1992.


Following issuance of the Draft EIS to the public, over 1,000 comments were received by the BLM and were analyzed and
considered in the preparation of the Final EIS. During preparation of the Final EIS, additional formal and informal
meetings were held with interested publics and agencies to develop additional information and new alternatives
for the proposal based on the public comment received on the Draft EIS. These meetings included an informal open house
and public meeting held in Carlsbad, NM, on May 27, 1993, to inform the public of the progress on the project, including
development of two additional alternatives and additional scientific data to be used in the analysis of impacts and
development of mitigation measures. The Final EIS was released to the public and filed with EPA on December 17, 1993,
with over 800 copies mailed out to agencies, organizations and the general public.
Following the end of the 30-day availability period for the Final EIS, the ROD was prepared and signed by the BLM New
Mexico Acting State Director on January 31, 1994.

Labor Certification Process for the Temporary Employment of Aliens in Agriculture and Logging in the United States:
1994 Adverse Effect Wage Rates and Allowable Charges for Agricultural and Logging Workers' Meals


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment Service, Employment and Training Administration, Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of adverse effect wage rates (AEWRs) and allowable charges for meals for 1994.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Director, U.S. Employment Service, announces 1994 adverse effect wage rates (AEWRs) for employers seeking nonimmigrant
alien (H-2A) workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural labor or services and the allowable charges employers
seeking nonimmigrant alien workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural labor or services or logging work may
levy upon their workers when they provide three meals per day.


AEWRs are the minimum wage rates which the Department of Labor has determined must be offered and paid to U.S. and alien
workers by employers of nonimmigrant alien agricultural workers (H-2A visaholders). AEWRs are established
to prevent the employment of these aliens from adversely affecting wages of similarly employed U.S. workers.
The Director also announces the new rates which covered agricultural and logging employers may charge their workers
for three daily meals.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Attorney General may not approve an employer's petition for admission of temporary alien agricultural (H-2A)
workers to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature in the United States unless the
petitioner has applied to the Department of Labor (DOL) for an H-2A labor certification. The labor certification
must show that: (1) There are not sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, and qualified and who will be available
at the time and place needed to perform the labor or services involved in the petition; and (2) the employment of the
alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United
States similarly employed. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 1184(c), and 1188.


DOL's regulations for the H-2A program require that covered employers offer and pay their U.S. and H-2A
workers no less than the applicable hourly adverse effect wage rate (AEWR). 20 CFR 655.102(b)(9); see also 20 CFR 655.107.
Reference should be made to the preamble to the July 5, 1989, final rule (54 FR 28037), which explains in great depth
the purpose and history of AEWRs, DOL's discretion in setting AEWRs, and the AEWR computation methodology at 20 CFR
655.107(a). See also 52 FR 20496, 20502-20505 (June 1, 1987).


A. Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for 1994


Adverse effect wage rates (AEWRs) are the minimum wage rates which DOL has determined must be offered and paid to U.S.
and alien workers by employers of nonimmigrant (H-2A) agricultural workers. DOL emphasizes, however, that
such employers must pay the highest of the AEWR, the applicable prevailing wage or the statutory minimum wage, as specified
in the regulations. 20 CFR 655.102(b)(9). Except as otherwise provided in 20 CFR Part 655, Subpart B, the regionwide
AEWR for all agricultural employment (except those occupations deemed inappropriate under the special circumstances
provisions of 20 CFR 655.93) for which temporary alien agricultural labor (H-2A) certification is being sought,
is equal to the annual weighted average hourly wage rate for field and livestock workers (combined) for the region
as published annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA does not provide data on Alaska). 20 CFR 655.107(a).

The regulation at 20 CFR 655.107(a) requires the Director, U.S. Employment Service, to publish USDA field and livestock
worker (combined) wage data as AEWRs in a 

Federal Register

 notice. Accordingly, the 1994 AEWRs for work performed on or after the effective date of this notice, are set forth
in the table below:








B. Allowable Meal Charges




Among the minimum benefits and working conditions which DOL requires employers to offer their alien and U.S. workers
in their applications for temporary logging and H-2A agricultural labor certification is the provision of
three meals per day or free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities. 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.202(b)(4).
Where the employer provides meals, the job offer must state the charge, if any, to the worker for meals.

DOL has published at 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.111(a) the methodology for determining the maximum amounts covered
H-2A agricultural employers may charge their U.S. and foreign workers for meals. The same methodology is applied
at 20 CFR 655.202(b)(4) and 655.211(a) to covered H-2B logging employers. These rules provide for annual adjustments
of the previous year's allowable charges based upon Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940204-2-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940204-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each year the maximum charges allowed by 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.202(b)(4) are changed by the same percentage
as the twelve-month percent change in the CPI for all Urban Consumers for Food (CPI-U for Food) between December
of the year just past and December of the year prior to that. Those regulations and 20 CFR 655.111(a) and 655.211(a)
provide that the appropriate Regional Administrator (RA), Employment and Training Administration, may permit
an employer to charge workers no more than a higher maximum amount for providing them with three meals a day, if justified
and sufficiently documented. Each year, the higher maximum amounts permitted by 20 CFR 655.111(a) and 655.211(a)
are changed by the same percentage as the twelve-month percent change in the CPI-U for Food between December
of the year just past and December of the year prior to that. The regulations require the Director, U.S. Employment
Service, to make the annual adjustments and to cause a notice to be published in the 

Federal Register

 each calendar year, announcing annual adjustments in allowable charges that may be made by covered agricultural
and logging employers for providing three meals daily to their U.S. and alien workers. The 1993 rates were published
in a notice on February 1, 1993 at 58 FR 6643.


DOL has determined the percentage change between December of 1992 and December of 1993 for the CPI-U for Food
was 2.2 percent.


Accordingly, the maximum allowable charges under 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4), 655.202(b)(4), 655.111, and 655.211 were
adjusted using this percentage change, and the new permissible charges for 1994 are as follows: (1) For 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4)
and 655.202(b)(4), the charge, if any, shall be no more than $6.81 per day, unless the RA has approved a higher charge
pursuant to 20 CFR 655.111 or 655.211(b); for 20 CFR 655.111 and 655.211, the RA may permit an employer to charge workers
up to $8.51 per day for providing them with three meals per day, if the employer justifies the charge and submits to the
RA the documentation required to support the higher charge.

of ascertaining continuing compliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHA deems necessary;

If CSA has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it is using under this program, it shall promptly inform
the test standard developing organization of this fact and provide that organization with appropriate relevant
information upon which its concerns are based;

CSA shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentation of the scope or conditions of its recognition.
As part of this condition, CSA agrees that it will allow no representation that it is either a recognized or an accredited
Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material
to which this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certain products; 

All products certified within this program shall be tested and certified only at the Rexdale facility. Products which
may have been previously evaluated at any of CSA's other facilities must be re-evaluated at the Rexdale facility in
order to be considered to have been approved under the NRTL program. 

In order to distinguish between products tested and certified by CSA under the OSHA/NRTL program at the Rexdale facility
from all other CSA facilities or from non-NRTL programs, the following procedures shall be followed for all products
tested and certified at the Rexdale facility under the OSHA/NRTL program:




Where the CSA registered certification mark is utilized on a label on the product, the label will also bear the acronym
``NRTL''; 

The product shall also be clearly identified in the Directory of CSA Certified Products by using the ``NRTL'' acronym.




CSA shall inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership or key personnel, including details;


CSA will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in all areas where it has been recognized; and 

CSA will always cooperate with OSHA to assure compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and
29 CFR 1910.7.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The invention listed below is owned by an agency of the U.S. Government and is available for licensing in the U.S. in
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research
and development.






U.S. Patent Application Number 08/129,294, filed September 24, 1993, and entitled ``Ultrasonic Dynamic Vector
Stress Measurement Method and Sensor''_The present invention relates in general to dynamic stress measurement
when a material is put under a load and more particularly to a method and apparatus for measuring changes in stress via
a pulsed phase locked loop technique.


A stress measurement method and sensor according to the invention consists of directly and dynamically measuring
stress changes at the location touched by a probe device when a material or structure is placed under a load. Electronics
employing a pulsed phase locked loop (P2L2) technology are coupled to a probe system which is placed in contact with
a material under stress. A gated signal from the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a free running oscillator on
all the time, drives the transducer exciter at the transmitter and causes an acoustic wave to be propagated across
a sample under stress. The VCO also sends a reference signal to the mixer. The output of the mixer represents the phase
difference of the reference and propagated signals and serves as a feedback signal to the VCO. This phase difference
tracks the changes in stress in the sample. The P2L2 reacts to the change in stress by changing its operating frequency
according to a specified relationship. The AC component of the feedback signal represents the change in voltage needed
to keep the system in quadrature to follow the change in stress. This signal is extracted for amplitude calibration.
Calibration is accomplished by placing the probe on a plate of similar propagation factors and a known cyclic change
in applied stress. The resulting AC signal multiplied by a calibration factor is equal to the stress.

The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive
or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing
this technology.

U.S. Patent Application Number 08/118, 466, filed September 7, 1993, and entitled ``Method for Ultrasonic Imaging
and Device for Performing the Method''_The present invention relates in general to ultrasonic imaging of internal
structures and flaws in materials, and specifically to a new method for coupling an ultrasonic transducer to a test
specimen with irregular or complex surface geometry and a new device for performing the method.

The present invention is a method for ultrasonic imaging of interior structures and flaws in a test specimen with smooth
or irregular contact surfaces, in which an ultrasonic transducer is coupled acoustically to the contact surface
via a plurality of ultrasonic wave guides with equal delay times. The wave guides are thin and bendable, so they adapt
to variations in the distance between the transducer and different parts of the contact surface by bending more or
less. All parts of the irregular contact surface accordingly receive sound waves that are in phase, even when the contact
surface is irregular, so a coherent sound wave is infused in the test specimen. The wave guides can be arranged in the
form of an ultrasonic brush, with a flat head for coupling to a flat transducer, and free bristles that can be pressed
against the test specimen. By bevelling the bristle ends at a suitable angle, shear mode waves can be infused into the
test specimen from a longitudinal mode transducer.

The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive
or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing

U.S. Patent Application Number 08/153,930, filed November 15, 1993, and entitled ``Method and Apparatus To Characterize
Ultrasonically Reflective Contrast Agents''_The present invention relates in general to a method and apparatus
for characterizing the time and frequency response of ultrasonically reflective contrast agents.

The present invention is a method and apparatus for characterizing the time and frequency response of an ultrasonically
reflective contrast agent. An ultrasonically reflective contrast agent is injected, under constant pressure,
into a fluid flowing through a pump flow circuit. The fluid and the ultrasonically reflective contrast agent are uniformly
mixed in a mixing chamber, and the uniform mixture is passed through a contrast agent chamber. The contrast agent chamber
is acoustically and axially interposed between an ultrasonic transducer chamber and an acoustic isolation chamber.
A pulse of ultrasonic energy is transmitted into the contrast agent chamber from the ultrasonic transducer chamber.
An echo waveform is received from the ultrasonically reflective contrast agent, and it is analyzed to determine the
time and frequency response of the ultrasonically reflective contrast agent.

The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive

U.S. Patent Application Number 08/141,294, filed October 19, 1993, and entitled ``Optical Flameout Detector''_The
present invention relates in general to flameout detectors for monitoring the presence of a flame and more particularly
to an optical-based flameout detector.
An optical flameout device according to the invention monitors the presence of a flame within a combustion chamber.
The optical flameout detection system responds to gross changes in combustor light intensity, which are monitored
in two spectral bands. A photomultiplier tube makes optical measurements in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum,
and a silicon photodiode covers the visible region. The detectors, located outside the combustion chamber, receive
the light energy radiated from the combustion process through fiber optic probes designed to operate in a high pressure
environment. The optical fibers are aimed diagonally through the center of the injector at the combustion chamber
wall downstream of the injector. The probed observe events occurring within a narrow conical-shaped field of view
so that the system can quickly detect longitudinal movement of the flame front away from the injector. If a change in
intensity of the flame is detected, the fuel supply to the combustion chamber is shut off, limiting the amount of unburned
fuel in the combustion chamber which could reignite.
The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive
or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Maintenance Inspection Procedure Public Workshop</DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) will hold a public workshop on March 31, 1994, to conduct
initial discussions regarding the draft maintenance inspection procedure developed for use by NRC inspectors to
verify the implementation of 10 CFR 50.65, ``Requirements for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear
Power Plants'' (the Maintenance Rule). The effective date of the Maintenance Rule is July 10, 1996.



NRC draft Inspection Procedure ``Maintenance Inspection Procedure XXXXX'' has been developed to ascertain compliance
with the Maintenance Rule and to verify that licensees using NUMARC 93-01 ``Industry Guidance for Monitoring
the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants'' have satisfactorily implemented the Maintenance Rule.

The commission believes that it would be beneficial to obtain public comment on this procedure from all interested
parties at a public workshop. Participants are encouraged to ask questions and provide written comments on the procedure
during the workshop. Written comments received from interested parties unable to attend the workshop will also be
considered through April 14, 1994.

At the workshop, NRC representatives will present an overview of the inspection program, the contents of the maintenance
inspection procedure and, as applicable, issues related to the Maintenance Rule and the NUMARC 93-01 industry
guidance. NRC regional inspection representatives will be available to participate in the discussions. The workshop
will provide the participants an opportunity to ask questions, make comments during the discussion or submit written
comments for NRC consideration. The workshop will conclude with a summary of the major issues identified at the meeting.
The planned use of the procedure during pilot inspections will also be discussed.

In order to ensure that adequate seating is available for the meeting, persons planning to attend the workshop are
requested to either call the contact designated below or complete and forward the attached registration form to the
same contact by March 25, 1994. A block of rooms has been reserved at the Holiday Inn Crown Plaza Hotel (1-800-638-5963)
for the convenience of meeting attendees. These rooms will be available at a reduced group rate until March 9, 1994.
Attendees should identify themselves with the NRC Maintenance Workshop, 

#

4093, in order to ensure the group rate. The NRC however, does not encourage nor support frequenting this or any other
specific establishment. The hotel will collect a ten dollar fee at room check in or the morning of the workshop to cover
expenses for morning and afternoon refreshments.

The draft procedure ``Maintenance Inspection Procedure XXXXX'' is publicly available at the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 by referencing a memorandum from Gary G. Zech to Elizabeth J. Yeates,
dated January 25, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 10, 1991, the NRC published the ``Requirements for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear
Power Plants'' as  50.65 of 10 CFR part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities.''
The Commission determined that a Maintenance Rule was needed because proper maintenance is essential to plant safety,
especially as plants age. The Maintenance Rule will become effective on July 10, 1996. The five year period to implement
the rule permits time to develop implementation guidance, inspection procedures and sufficient time for licensees
to implement the rule requirements to ensure full conformance by July 10, 1996.



Shortly after the Maintenance Rule was published, the NRC and the Nuclear Management and Resource Council (NUMARC)
embarked on parallel efforts to develop rule implementation guidance. The NRC staff determined that the NUMARC document
provided an acceptable method for licensees to implement the requirements of the Maintenance Rule. In June 1993,
the Commission issued Regulatory Guide 1.160, ``Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants,''
which endorsed the NUMARC guidance, NUMARC 93-01, ``Industry Guideline for Monitoring the Effectiveness
of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated May 1993. Subsequently, NUMARC conducted a verification and validation
(V & V) program, with NRC staff observation, to test their guidance on several representative systems at nine
nuclear units. The V & V effort concluded that the guidelines were adequate to implement the Maintenance Rule.

The NRC staff has developed an inspection procedure to be used by NRC inspectors to verify the implementation of the
Maintenance Rule requirements. The NRC staff expects to validate the inspection procedure during pilot inspections
at selected nuclear power facilities following the March 1994 workshop.

After considering the comments obtained from the workshop and information obtained during the implementation of
the pilot inspections, the NRC staff expects to revise the inspection procedure as necessary, and conduct another
workshop to provide interested parties an opportunity to participate in discussions on the results of the pilot inspections
and any revisions to the inspection procedure.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S.C., chapter 35), this notice announces a request
to revise the use of OPM Form 805 that collects information from the public. OPM Form 805, Application to be Listed Under
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, is used to elicit information from persons applying for voter registration under the
authority of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The requirements for voter eligibility vary from State to State; therefore,
OPM Form 805 is a blanket number covering 10 forms which conform to the individual State's requirements. The form requires
20 minutes to complete. Approximately 10 individuals complete the form annually for a total public burden of 4 hours.

Resolution Trust Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revised statement of policy.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) has revised its policy statement concerning the abrogation of leases on units
in properties which were subject to state and local rent or securities regulations prior to their acquisition by the
RTC as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution. This policy modifies the current Statement
of Policy for the Disposition of Residential Units Which Were Previously Subject to Rent and Securities Regulations,
dated February 22, 1991, by increasing to 130 percent of area median income the maximum income of households governed
by paragraph 4B of this policy.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




1. Purpose



To revise the policy statement concerning the abrogation of leases on units in properties which were subject to state
and local rent or securities regulations prior to their acquisition by the RTC as conservator or receiver for an insured
depository institution.



2. Scope and Applicability



This statement of policy of the RTC is applicable when the RTC as conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution
acquires cooperative and/or condominium residential dwelling units which were subject to state or local rent or
securities regulations prior to their acquisition by the RTC.



3. Background



It is clearly the intention of the RTC to avoid displacing low- and moderate-income tenants from such units. However,
in making this statement of policy, the RTC recognizes the competing interests associated with such regulated cooperative
and condominium units. On the one hand, some state or local rent and securities regulations have provided for the regulation
of rents and the continuation of certain tenancies at specified levels. On the other hand, the RTC's statutory duties
are to expeditiously manage and resolve failed insured depository institutions, to maximize returns on their assets
and comply with the affordable housing provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement
Act of 1989 (FIRREA). The RTC, and ultimately the taxpayers, cannot be put in the position of continuing to underwrite
rental of such units at a significant loss to the RTC, or be compelled to sell the units as tenant-occupied at greatly
diminished values due to the possible applicability of the rent and securities regulations. The RTC has balanced
the statutory mandates of the RTC and the state and local interests at issue, and has determined that disaffirmance
or repudiation of leases of these units and the resulting preemption of state and local rent and securities regulations,
is required in certain circumstances. The RTC has also determined that expanding the definition of low- and moderate-income
from one hundred and fifteen percent (115 percent) of the median income in the area involved, to one hundred and thirty
percent (130 percent) of the median income in the area involved, as determined by the U.S. Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) with adjustments for family size, will assist the RTC in meeting its statutory mandate to
maximize the preservation of the availability and affordability of residential real property for low- and moderate-income
individuals without significantly adversely affecting the ability of the RTC to satisfy its numerous other statutory
duties. Accordingly, the RTC hereby revises its Statement of Policy for the Disposition of Residential Units Which
Were Previously Subject to Rent or Securities Regulations dated February 22, 1991, as stated in paragraph 4B below.
All other material terms of the February 22, 1991, Statement of Policy remain unchanged.



4. Policy and Guidelines



A. The policy of the RTC will be to exercise its disaffirmance or repudiation powers with regard to cooperative and/or
condominium residential dwelling units which were subject to state or local rent or securities regulations prior
to their acquisition by the RTC as conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution when it determines
that: (1) The insured depository institution is a party to the lease; (2) the performance of which the conservator
or receiver determines, in its discretion, to be burdensome; and (3) the disaffirmance or repudiation of which the
conservator or receiver determines, in its discretion, will promote the orderly administration of the institution's
affairs, the RTC will not repudiate the leases.

B. Where the RTC finds that units are leased by low- or moderate-income tenants, the RTC will not exercise its disaffirmance
or repudiation powers with respect to those units. For this purpose, a low- or moderate-income tenant is defined as
a family or individual whose income does not exceed one hundred and thirty percent (130 percent) of the median income
in the area involved, as determined by the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with adjustments
for family size.



C. Where the RTC determines to disaffirm or repudiate leases of such units, the RTC may, in its discretion, offer the
units for sale to the existing tenants or negotiate other arrangements, on terms which the RTC finds acceptable, in
accordance with its mandate to maximize recoveries on the assets of the institutions in its control. If the existing
tenants decline or fail to purchase the units or to enter into any other agreement acceptable to the RTC, the RTC will
be free to consummate the disaffirmance or repudiation and to take whatever action it deems appropriate for the disposition
of the units.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The CHX proposes to establish rules for an institutional trading system, the Match Market Exchange (``MMX'') facility,
that integrates an electronic order match system with a facility for brokering trades.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish rules for the MMX facility, an institutional trading system
that integrates an electronic order match system with a facility for brokering trades. The MMX facility is designed
to combine the advantages of current institutional order systems with the advantages of exchange trading.
Although the MMX will be operated by the Exchange, it was jointly developed by the CHX and Global Trade, Inc. Users of
the MMX will include institutional customers, specialists, MMX market makers and brokers. These users will communicate
with the MMX facility through personal computers and modems. The MMX facility will electronically match users' orders
in an allocation procedure described more fully below. If an electronic match occurs, the trade will be priced at the
market price at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute window period and will be executed at that time. If
a match does not occur, users will still have the opportunity to find the other side of their trades through participating
brokers.


2. Description of How the MMX Facility Operates


The following is a brief overview of the MMX facility, followed by a more detailed description about certain aspects
of the system.
MMX will permit direct order entry by both CHX members and customers of those members. Prior to the time a non-member
user enters orders into the system, the user will enter into an agreement with CHX agreeing to be bound by the Exchange's
rules governing MMX and will submit the names of the Midwest Clearing Corporation members through which the user will
clear. In order for the non-member user to designate a clearing firm, it must enter into a give-up agreement with the
clearing firm and provide a copy to the Exchange. CHX member users will clear MMX transactions through their existing
clearing arrangements.
For each order, the user will enter the following information:
 Stock ticker symbol;
 The number of shares;
 Capacity (buy, sell or sell short);
 The limit price (optional);
 Linked order conditions (optional);
 Minimum trade size (optional);
 Excluded category of contra parties (optional);
 Names of individual excluded users (optional);
 Liquidity fee or credit (optional);
 Near match range and near match broker (optional);
 Order visibility; and
 Clearing firm.
The user will send this information via modem to the MMX during the Pre-Cross Period. During this time users can review,
edit or cancel their orders.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to orders manually entered by users, MMX will include guarantees by MMX market makers. These market makers
will be Exchange members who register with the Exchange to be MMX market makers. As such, they will be obligated to guarantee
a maximum execution size to all users of the system. It is currently anticipated that the maximum size of the guarantee
will be ten thousand shares per issue for a certain class of stocks, five thousand shares per issue for another class
of stocks, and two thousand shares per issue for a third class of stocks. MMX market maker guarantees will automatically
be entered at the beginning of the Pre-Cross Period and will include a default liquidity fee or credit to be associated
with a specific MMX guarantee. (Liquidity fees and liquidity credits are discussed below.) MMX market makers can
improve this liquidity fee or credit and increase the size of their guarantee during the Pre-Cross Period.

Users other than MMX market makers will have the option of having their orders displayed to other users of MMX. If a non-market
maker user elects to have its order displayed, the order will be displayed under certain circumstances. Users will
be charged lower fees for using the MMX Facility if they agree to have their orders displayed.

Finally, the CHX's CQS quotation will automatically be fed into the MMX Facility on a real-time basis. When the consolidated
best bid and offer spread of an issue is 1/8, the MMX Facility will look at the CHX quote to determine whether there are
orders which would be executed if a trade took place at the consolidated best bid or best offer (

i.e.,

 if the CHX quote equaled the consolidated quote). If so, this bid and/or offer will be entered as an order in MMX. If entered,
these orders will have the highest priority of execution.




All matched orders will be executed at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute window period at the market
price at such time. The market price will be calculated based upon the spread of a particular issue. In issues where
the spread in the consolidated best bid and offer is 1/4 or other even fraction point spread, the cross will be priced
at the middle of the spread. In issues with a consolidated best bid and offer spread of 3/8 or other odd fraction (other
than 1/8), the price will be at the 1/8 closest to the last sale. In issues with a consolidated best bid and offer of 1/8,
if there are more shares offered for sale in the MMX Facility (excluding the MMX market maker guarantee), then the 1/8
spread issues will cross at the bid. If, however, there are more bids than offers in the MMX facility, then the 1/8 spread
issues will be crossed at the offer price. In the event that there are an equal number of shares on both sides of the CHX
quotation, the cross will execute at the offer. Executions in MMX will be limited to those equity securities that are
either listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'') on the CHX. Users may, however, enter orders for
securities in which the Exchange does not have UTP; if a match is found in these securities, the cross will not be executed
in MMX. Instead, these orders will be delivered to a broker-dealer who is eligible to execute the cross in the market
in which it is traded.

Those orders that have been executed in the cross will be immediately transmitted by MMX to the Exchange for recordation
and reporting to the Consolidated Tape. Trades will then be cleared by the designated clearing firm. After receiving
an execution report (described below), institutions will then be able to reallocate trades to different clearing
brokers, if desired.

Immediately after the cross, users will be notified if their orders have been executed. If an order was not executed,
the user may receive an administrative message (depending on the ``near match'' parameters they have specified)
asking whether the user wants a broker to call it to negotiate a trade with another user that has entered similar ``near
match'' parameters.



3. Unique Aspects of the MMX Facility



The most fundamental feature of the MMX facility is the use of liquidity fees and liquidity credits to determine the
level of priority for order matching. Rather than matching orders on the basis of time priority, the MMX facility provides
incentives to those users that provide liquidity to the system. The size of the liquidity fee or credit determines
the level of priority for order matching, with those users that are willing to pay the highest liquidity fee having
the highest execution priority (except for orders that are part of the CHX quote) and those users desiring to be paid
for providing liquidity (

i.e.,

 orders with a liquidity credit) having the lowest execution priority. Liquidity fees and credits will only be paid
when an order with a liquidity fee is matched with an order with a liquidity credit. When that happens, a liquidity fee
that is equal to the size of the liquidity credit will be paid. In all other cases, no liquidity fees will be paid.

In order to provide executions that are equitable, immediately prior to the match, all orders for a security are first
sorted into groups and then each group is prioritized for execution. Except for orders that are part of CHX's quote,
which will be placed in one group and will receive the highest priority for execution, a group will consist of either
all buy orders or all sell orders in a security that have the same liquidity fee or credit. Groups will be prioritized
by liquidity fee or credit (as stated earlier).

Groups will only be matched if the liquidity credit required by orders in one group is less than or equal to the liquidity
fee offered by orders in the other group. Groups will be matched starting with the group of buy orders with the highest
priority. This group will be matched with the group of sell orders with the highest priority.

If the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is the same, all orders in both groups will be matched. If the aggregate
size of all orders in both groups is not the same, orders in the group with the smaller aggregate size will be allocated
among orders in the group with the larger size on a pro-rata basis. If this results in any order receiving an odd lot or
a mixed lot (

e.g.,

 265 shares), the amount of shares that order receives shall be rounded down to the nearest round lot (

e.g., 

200 shares). All the odd lots for a particular Group (

e.g.,

 the 65 shares) shall be aggregated and then allocated to the largest order in the Group. If, after matching orders in
a buy group with orders in a sell group, unmatched orders remain in the group of buy orders, MMX will continue the process
of matching this group with successively lower priority groups of sell orders until all of the orders in the group of
buy orders are either matched or are unable to be matched.

After completion of the match described above, MMX will continue the process of matching groups and orders within
those groups in accordance with the rules described above starting with successively lower priority buy order groups
until no more matches can be made.

Once all of the matches are made, MMX will determine whether any matched orders are conditional orders and if so, whether
their conditions are fully satisfied. In the event that certain conditions are not fully satisfied, MMX will remove
that order (and any other orders whose conditions are not fully satisfied). MMX will then erase the match for all orders
in that security and will restart the matching process excluding all conditional orders whose conditions were not
fully satisfied in the last matching process.

This matching process and liquidity fee/credit payment scheme results in the liquidity fee being paid only when necessary,
providing meaningful advantages to those willing to pay.

a. 

Example 

#

1:




Buy group 1: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ + will pay 1$/shr liquidity fee

Buy group 2: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ

Sell group 1: Order 1_SELL 2000 XYZ




Because the order in Buy group 1 is willing to pay a liquidity fee, this order will have the highest priority and will
match with the order in Sell group 1. It will not be necessary for the order in Buy group 1 to pay a liquidity fee in this
case.

b. 

Example 

#

2:




Buy group 1: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ + will pay 1$/shr liquidity fee

Buy group 2: Order 1_BUY 2000 XYZ

Sell group 1: Order 1_SELL 1000 XYZ

Sell group 2: Order 1_SELL 2000 XYZ + wants a 1$/shr liquidity credit

Sell group 2: Order 2_SELL 2000 XYZ + wants a 1$/shr liquidity credit




Because the order in Buy group 1 is willing to pay a liquidity fee, this order will match first with the order in Sell group
1 (1000 shares), then with the orders in Sell group 2 (each of whom will receive 500). The order in Buy group 1 will pay
no liquidity fee for the order in Sell group 1, but will pay 1$/share for the orders in Sell group 2. Thus, the user
will only pay an average liquidity fee of 1/2$/share. Note: The order in Buy group 2 would not participate in the
match as the only shares remaining to be matched require that a liquidity fee be paid. 

Orders willing to pay a liquidity fee will experience higher match rates than the other order types, with only an occasional
payment of the liquidity fee. As in the above examples, because of the higher priority, a willingness to pay a higher
liquidity fee will often result in a 

lower 

average liquidity fee paid or even 

no 

liquidity fee paid. Again, because of the priority rules, this system minimizes the liquidity fee rather than maximizing
the shares matched. The CHX believes that this encourages users to enter liquidity fees and credits without fear of
being disadvantaged by the system. These liquidity charges are exchange fees and credits and will be paid to the exchange
for disbursal to those entitled to receive them.



4. Other Issues



As discussed above, while entering stocks into his computer, a user can include a limit price. This feature allows
a user to specify a maximum buy price or minimum sell price to protect the user against large swings in the price of a stock
that may occur between the time he enters the trade into his computer and the cross. If a limit price is entered, the order
will not participate in the match if the stock is above (or below) the limit price at the time of the cross, depending
on whether the order is a buy order (or sell order). Of course, if the stock is within the limit range, the execution price
will be the same as for all other stocks in the cross. 

In addition, as discussed above, users can enter linked orders. These are orders that are combined with other orders.
For example, a user may only want to sell stock A if he can buy stock B. A user would then link his sell order of stock A to
his buy order of stock B. Then, when the match occurs, the user's order to sell stock A will only be executed if the user's
order to buy stock B is also executed. Otherwise, both orders will remain unmatched. 

The MMX facility, by allowing linked orders and allowing orders that specify a limit price, allows money managers
greater cash management capabilities. The CHX believes that this in turn will cause the effective match rate of the
MMX facility to be greater than other crossing systems. 

It should also be noted that a user can only prohibit a match with another particular user because of a concern that an
ERISA violation might occur if a match took place. 



5. Fees



The Exchange will only charge a fee to users of the MMX Facility if their order is executed (or matched, in the case of
securities that are not listed on the Exchange or have UTP). The Exchange fee will be as follows: Orders entered by MMX
market makers and orders that are part of CHX's quote will not be charged a transaction fee; users who enter orders that
the user is willing to display will be charged $.005 per share; and all other users will pay $.02 per share. There will
be no fee to enter or cancel orders in the system. The Exchange fee does not cover liquidity fees and credits. The MMX
market makers will be paid 1/8th of a cent per share when they do not participate in a cross in their issue so long as the
liquidity parameter enter by the MMX market maker is within a pre-determined range. This 1/8 of a cent per share fee
will be paid by the Exchange out of the 1/2 of a cent (or 2 cent) user fee that CHX will receive from users of the MMX facility.
This will provide the MMX Market Maker with an incentive to providing a guarantee. In the event there is more than one
MMX market maker in an issue, the 1/8 of a cent per share fee will be paid to the MMX market maker that enters the highest
liquidity fee or lowest liquidity credit. If more than one MMX market maker enters the same fee or credit, such fee will
be pro-rated. An additional Exchange fee will be imposed on all users equal to the liquidity fee to be paid with respect
to a particular order, and an Exchange credit will occur that is equal to the liquidity credit to be received. The clearing
broker will collect all fees from institutions and submit the appropriate amounts to Midwest Clearing Corporation
(``MCC''). MCC, in turn, will pay the appropriate amounts to clearing brokers for forwarding to institutions.

6. Surveillance 



To protect against any potentially manipulative activity, the Exchange will monitor quote changes prior to the match
and shortly thereafter to identify unusual trading activity. 



7. ``Near Match Orders'' and Floor Broker Participation 



Because of the possibility that the match rate will be below 100%, the MMX facility will allow users to send orders that
are not crossed in the match to a broker in the event of a ``near match.'' A near match is the presence of a buyer and seller
in the MMX facility who did not match merely because the liquidity fees and credits that they required, differed. For
example, a seller may be willing to sell and pay a 6 cent per share liquidity fee, but the buyer wants to be paid 7 cents
per share for providing liquidity. If a near match occurs users will get administrative messages stating that a near
match occurred. Each user would then have the option of indicating that it would like a pre-determined broker to call
to negotiate that order. If both parties to the near match wish to negotiate, then the broker (or brokers) will receive
a negotiate message. Because the broker or brokers do not learn anything about the order unless both parties to the
near match have given their approval, the users of the MMX facility retain complete control during this process. 

Similar to the ``near match'' function described above, floor brokers can enter a message that, after the match, will
tell the users entering orders in a particular stock of an indication of interest in that stock (even when there is not
an actual order). The user would then be free to contact the floor broker to negotiate a trade. The MMX facility will
give users the ability to screen out indications if they become dissatisfied with the quality of the information.




8. Execution Reports 



Execution reports will be sent after any execution occurs. For customers using DTC's ID system, information will
be forwarded to the clearing broker who will then submit the information to the ID system. 



9. Statutory Basis 



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest, and is not designed
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers. 



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition. 



The Exchange believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change. 



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



No comments were received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-93-19 and should be submitted by February
25, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., Relating to the Use of Geographic Indicators Appended to Market Maker Identifiers Disseminated Over the NASD's
OTC Bulletin Board Service</DOCTITLE>



January 28, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 10, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to require market makers participating in the NASD's OTC Bulletin Board Service

 

 (``OTCBB'') to append a fifth-character, geographic indicator to their market maker identifier (``MMID'') on the
OTCBB screen when the firm's trading desk for a particular security quoted on the OTCBB is located away from the firm's
primary trading office.
 The following is new language to be added to the recently codified OTCBB rules. Language to be added is italicized.





OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service Rules 



Section 4





(c) In cases where a market maker has more than one trading location, a fifth-character, geographic indicator shall
be appended to the market maker's identifier for that security to identify the branch location where the security
is traded. The fifth-character branch indicators are established by the Association and published from time to time
in the Nasdaq/COS symbol directory.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The NASD is proposing to amend section 4 of its OTCBB rules to require market makers participating in the OTCBB to append
a fifth-character, geographic indicator to their MMIDs when the firm's trading desk for a security quoted on the OTCBB
is located away from the firm's primary trading office. The NASD believes that the use of fifth-character, geographic
indicators is necessary to avoid confusion and delay by market participants in contacting market makers in securities
quoted on the OTCBB. Specifically, the NASD believes that the use of geographic indicators will ensure that traders
will direct their calls to the appropriate location where the market maker for the stock is located and avoid instances
where multiple phone calls are needed to access a market maker's quote.

In addition, the NASD believes mandatory use of the fifth-character, geographic indicator is necessary in light
of developments associated with the NASD's Nasdaq Workstation II

SM

 service. Specifically, with Nasdaq Workstation II, market makers' telephone numbers will not be displayed on the
OTCBB screen, but may be recalled separately. Accordingly, once Nasdaq Workstation II is in operation, unless fifth-character,
geographic indicators are used, there may be confusion among market participants concerning the trading location
of securities quoted on the OTCBB. The NASD also notes that the use of fifth-character, geographic indicators already
has been mandated for market makers in securities traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market

 

.

<TEXT>
 

2. Statutory Basis


The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires
that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general,
to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the NASD believes the use of fifth-character, geographic
indicators is consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the facilitation of transactions in
securities because it will eliminate unnecessary confusion and delay in trading of securities and foster cooperation
between members and market makers effecting trades in securities quoted on the OTCBB.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will:



A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or
B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by [insert
date 21 days from the date of publication].

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated; Application for Unlisted Trading Privileges
in an Over-the-Counter Issue and to Withdraw Unlisted Privileges in an Over-the-Counter Issue</DOCTITLE>





January 27, 1994.



On January 18, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), submitted an application for unlisted trading privileges
(``UTP'') pursuant to Section 12(f)(1)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') in the following over-the-counter
(``OTC'') security, 

i.e., 

a security not registered under Section 12(B) of the Act.






The above-referenced issue is being applied for as a replacement for the following security, which forms a portion
of the Exchange's program in which OTC securities are being traded pursuant to the granting of UTP.



The CHX also applied to withdraw UTP pursuant to Section 12(f)(4) of the Act for the following issue:






A replacement issue is being requested due to lack of trading activity.




Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit, on or before February 17, 1994, written comments, data views and arguments
concerning this application. Persons desiring to make written comments should file three copies with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.
Commentators are asked to address whether they believe the requested grant of UTP as well as the withdrawal of UTP would
be consistent with Section 12(f)(2), which requires that, in considering an application for extension or withdrawal
of UTP in an OTC security, the Commission consider, among other matters, the public trading activity in such security,
the character of such trading, the impact of such extension on the existing markets for such security, and the desirability
of removing impediments to and the progress that has been made toward the development of a national market system.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of application for deregistration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANT:

 ABT Money Market Series, Inc.




RELEVANT ACT SECTION:

 Section 8(f).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicant seeks an order declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. SEC records indicate
that applicant filed a notification of registration under section 8(a) of the Act of September 12, 1988. On October
14, 1988, applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The
registration statement was declared effective on January 9, 1989, and applicant's initial public offering commenced
on January 24, 1989.

2. At a meeting held on February 5, 1993, applicant's board of directors resolved to liquidate applicant. An information
statement outlining the plan of liquidation was filed with the SEC prior to the meeting, and was distributed to shareholders
immediately following the meeting. The information statement represented that continued operation of applicant
at its size was not economically feasible for applicant's shareholders or Palm Beach Capital Management, Ltd., applicant's
investment adviser.

3. The plan of liquidation was approved by applicant's shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders on February
26, 1993. As of that date, there were 290,955.34 shares of applicant's common stock outstanding, and a net asset value
per share of $1.00.

4. Applicant was liquidated on March 1, 1993, the next business day immediately following the meeting of applicant's
shareholders. The final distribution to shareholders was based on the net asset per share on the date of liquidation.
All expenses associated with the liquidation were assumed by applicant's adviser.

5. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor will it partake in, activities
other than those associated with the winding up of its affairs.

6. Applicant will file a certificate of dissolution with the State of Maryland, as the intent is to dissolve the corporation.

<DOCTITLE>The Griffin Funds, Inc., et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



January 27, 1994.




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS:

 The Griffin Funds, Inc. (``Griffin''), Griffin Financial Investment Advisers (the ``Adviser''), Griffin Financial
Services (the ``Distributor''), on behalf of Griffin and all other open-end management investment companies for
which the Adviser acts in the future as investment adviser or the Distributor acts in the future as principal underwriter
(collectively with Griffin, the ``Funds'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS:

 Exemption requested under section 6(c) from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 18(f), 18(g), 18(i),
22(c), and 22(d), and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order that would permit the Funds to issue an unlimited number of classes of shares representing
interests in the same portfolio of securities, assess a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions
of shares, and waive the CDSC in certain instances.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Griffin is a Maryland corporation registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Griffin
is a series company presently consisting of seven separate investment portfolios (the ``Portfolios''), each of
which has separate investment objectives and policies. The Portfolios are sold primarily, but not exclusively,
through offices of the Distributor, including locations in offices of Home Savings of America, FSB, a federally chartered
savings association, which is affiliated with the Adviser and the Distributor.

2. The Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, serves as investment
adviser to the Portfolios.

3. The Distributor, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, serves as the sponsor and
distributor of the Portfolios. The Distributor has entered into a distribution agreement with Griffin, pursuant
to which it has responsibility for distributing shares of the Portfolios. The Portfolios also have adopted distribution
plans pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act.

4. Applicants propose to establish a multiple distribution system (the ``Multi-Class System''). Under the Multi-Class
System, some or all of the Funds intend to offer three classes of shares: (a) a class offered in connection with a plan
adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act (the ``12b-1 Class''), (b) a class offered in connection with
a non-rule 12b-1 services plan (the ``Non-12b-1 Class''), and (c) a trust class (the ``Trust Class'').
In addition, the Funds may create additional 12b-1 Class, Non-12b-1 Class, and Trust Class shares that
differ according to the characteristics described below.

5. The 12b-1 Class shares will be offered pursuant to a plan of distribution (the ``12b-1 Plan'') approved
by the directors of a Fund in accordance with rule 12b-1 under the Act. Shares of the 12b-1 Class will be sold
to investors purchasing directly from a Fund's distributor, or to clients of certain financial institutions that
have entered into agreements with the Fund or the Fund's distributor to provide necessary distribution and administrative
services with respect to the 12b-1 Class. Distribution activities financed in accordance with a 12b-1
Plan may include advertising and marketing expenses, printing costs for new prospectuses and sales literature,
and payments to broker/dealers and others for distribution assistance.

6. The Non-12b-1 Class will be offered pursuant to a non-rule 12b-1 servicing plan (the ``Services Plan,''
and together with the 12b-1 Plans, the ``Plans'') approved by the board of directors of a Fund under which a Fund
will enter into servicing agreements with qualified financial institutions (``Organizations'') to provide necessary
administrative support services to customers of Organizations who are the beneficial owners of Non-12b-1
Class shares. Services provided pursuant to a Services Plan may include subaccounting; establishing and maintaining
accounts and records; aggregating and processing purchase and redemption orders; investing customers' assets
in shares of the Non-12b-1 Class; providing periodic statements; arranging for bank wires; processing dividend
payments; answering routine inquiries; assisting customers in changing divided options, account designations,
and addresses; forwarding shareholder communications; and other similar services.

<TEXT>
 

7. The Trust Class will be sold primarily to financial institutions in their capacity as fiduciaries for certain accounts,
such as living trusts, irrevocable trusts, foundations, endowments, retirement plans, and agency or custodial
accounts. The financial institutions provide services for the beneficial owners of Trust Class shares, such as determining
the appropriateness of investments, working with attorneys or accountants under the terms of a fiduciary relationship,
providing tax information, preparing and sending account statements, responding to inquiries, forwarding shareholder
communications, and establishing and maintaining account records. Trust Class shares will not be subject to 12b-1
Plans or Services Plans. 

8. The services provided under the Plans will not duplicate the services provided to the Funds by the Adviser or the
Distributor. Applicants will comply with the recent amendments to Article III, Section 26, of the Rules of Fair Practice
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the ``NASD'') regarding asset-based sales charges and
service fees. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July 7, 1992). 

9. The Funds may in the future create one or more classes of shares that would bear higher ongoing distribution charges
and/or services fees (``Class B shares'') and that would automatically convert into shares of another class that
bears lower ongoing distribution charges and/or services fees (``Class A shares'') up to six year after the purchase
of Class B shares. 

Shares purchased though the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares also
would be Class B shares. For purposes of conversion to Class A shares, Class B shares purchased through reinvestment
of dividends and other distributions will be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any class B
shares not purchased through reinvestment of dividends or other distributions convert to Class A shares, a 

pro rata 

portion of the Class B shares held in the sub-account will convert into Class A shares. The 

pro rata

 protion will be equal to the percentage of the shareholder's Class B shares not purchased through reinvestment of
dividends or other distributions that are converting into Class A shares relative to the shareholder's total Class
B shares not purchased through reinvestment of dividends or other distributions. 

10. The conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares would be subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel
or Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling to the effect that the conversion of Class B shares does not constitute
a taxable event under federal income tax law. The conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is not available.
In that event, no further conversions would occur and Class B shares might be subject to a higher level of ongoing distribution
charges and/or service fees for an indefinite period.

11. Shareholders generally will be limited to exchanging shares only for shares of the same or a similar class of shares
of another portfolio within the same group of investment companies, as such term is defined in rule 11a-3 under
the Act. The exchange policies of the Funds would, in all events, comply with rule 11a-3. 


12. In addition to expenses incurred under a 12b-1 Plan or Services Plan, each class of shares will bear certain
expenses specifically attributable to the particular class as set forth in Condition 1 below (``Class Expenses'').
The determination of which Class Expenses will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto
will be determined by a Fund's directors in the manner described in Condition 3 below. 

13. Each portfolio of a Fund will be charged with the direct liabilities of that portfolio and with a portion of the general
liabilities of the Fund in the same proportion that the assets of the portfolio bear to the assets of the Fund. In addition,
all outstanding shares representing interests in the same portfolio will bear the portfolio expenses, which would
first be allocated 

pro rata

 to each class on the basis of the relative net asset value of the respective class, and then further allocated on a per
share basis within the class, except that each class will bear the Class Expenses applicable to such class.

14. Applicants also propose that the Funds be permitted to impose a CDSC on redemptions of one or more classes of shares
that are not subject to a front-end sales load and waive the CDSC in certain instances. The amount of the CDSC and the
timing of its imposition may vary. Applicants also propose to impose a CDSC of up to 1% on redemptions that occur within
a year of the purchase date of certain classes of shares that are subject to a front-end sales load in cases where the
front-end sales load has been waived because the initial purchases of such shares totals $1,000,000 or more.

15. No CDSC will be imposed with respect to redemptions attributable to increases in the value of an account above the
net cost of the investment due to increases in the net asset value per share. No CDSC will be imposed on shares acquired
through reinvestment of income dividends or capital gain distributions, or shares purchased a specified period
of time prior to the redemptions. In determining whether a CDSC is payable, it will be assumed that shares, or amounts
representing shares, that are not subject to a CDSC are redeemed first and that other shares or amounts are then redeemed
in the order purchased. No CDSD will be imposed on any shares purchased prior to the effective date of the order.

16. Applicants intend to waive the CDSC on redemptions of shares in one or more of the following categories: (a) Following
the death or disability (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of a shareholder; (b) representing
a minimum required distribution from an IRA or other retirement plan to a shareholder who has reached age 701/2; (c)
incurred by current employees of the investment adviser to the Funds, or by current or former directors of the Funds;
or (d) resulting from a Fund's right to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset value of shares
held in the account is less than the effective minimum account size. Applicants may waive the CDSC in the case of some,
but not all, of these categories, provided that the selected waiver categories will be provided on a Fund-wide basis.
Applicants' prospectuses will list all available waiver categories.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class System might be deemed to result
in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1),
and violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act.

2. Section 18 is intended to prevent investment companies from issuing excessive amounts of senior securities and
thereby increasing unduly the speculative character of their junior securities, or from operating without adequate
assets or reserves. The proposed Multi-Class System does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing
assets or reserves. Nor will the Multi-Class System increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund, since
all shares will participate 

pro rata

 in all of a Fund's income and expenses (with the exception of Class Expenses).

3. Applicants assert that the Multi-Class system will preserve mutuality of risk with respect to all shares of a Fund.
Further, since all shares will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference or priority over
any other class in a Fund in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences with
respect to particular assets and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account), and the similarities
(and, with respect to Class Expenses and associated voting rights, dissimilarities) of the shares will be fully disclosed
in the prospectuses for each class of a Fund, investors will not be given misleading impressions as to the safety or
risk of the shares and the nature of the shares will not be rendered speculative.

4. Applicants also request an exemption from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the
Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions
of shares and waive the CDSC in certain instances. Applicants believe that the implementation of the CDSC in the manner
and under the circumstances described above would be fair, in the public interest and the interest of the shareholders
of the Funds, and would be consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act.

Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of a Fund will be identical in all respects, except
for differences related to: (a) The method of financing certain Class Expenses, which are limited to (i) transfer
agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and
postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, reports,
and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class or to regulatory agencies with respect to a specific class
of shares; (iii) blue sky registration or qualification fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration
fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support
the shareholders of a specific class of shares; (vi) different levels of 12b-1 Plan and/or Services Plan fees
and expenses (``Plan Payments'') incurred by a class of shares; (vii) litigation or other legal expenses relating
solely to one class of shares; and (viii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares;
(b) priorities with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions (which priorities would reflect only the
impact of Class Expenses properly allocated to one class); (c) the net asset values of the various classes of shares
in a portfolio that may differ as a result of the allocation of Class Expenses; (d) voting rights of the classes with
respect to the Plans; (e) the different exchange privileges, if any, of such classes as described in the prospectuses
(and statements of additional information) of the portfolios and consistent with any order granted pursuant to this
application; (f) class designation differences; and (g) the conversion of shares of one class to shares of a second
class up to six years after the purchase of the shares of the first class, which classes differ with respect to the distribution
services and administrative support fees payable by such classes of shares. Any additional incremental expenses
not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to
one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The directors of a Fund, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the creation of additional
classes of shares from time to time by an affirmative vote prior to the creation of any such class. The minutes of the
meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to
create any additional class of shares will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors' determination that the
creation is in the best interests of both the Fund involved and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of a Fund, including a majority of the directors
who are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by the fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at
least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of a Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes of shares.
The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Distributor and the Adviser will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Distributor and the Adviser at their
own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. Any Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through
(f) of rule 12b-1 as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
of the Non-12b-1 class will not receive the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

6. The directors of a Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning Plan Payments (including, in the
case of 12b-1 Plans, expenditures relating to distribution) complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1,
as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale (in the
case of 12b-1 shares) or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution (in
the case of 12b-1 shares) or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to a particular class
will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the
allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the
exercise of their fiduciary duties.

7. Dividends or other distributions paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends
are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be paid at the same dividend
rate, except that any Plan Payments and other Class Expenses relating to a particular class of shares will be borne
exclusively by the applicable class.

8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset values, dividends, and distribution of the classes
of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between those classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'')
who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to applicants that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports,
following request by a Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff, upon
the written request to the Fund for such work papers, by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited
to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director
and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a
``report on the policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies
and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of
the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards that may be adopted by the AICPA from
time to time.

9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset values, dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between
such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in Condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in Condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.

10. The prospectus for each portfolio with more than one class will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson
and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares may receive different compensation
for selling or servicing one particular class of shares over another class in the same portfolio.

11. The distributor of a Fund will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares to agree to conform to such standards.
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of a Fund with respect to the Plans and related agreements will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to
the directors of the Fund.
13. Each portfolio will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services,
fees, transfer agency expenses, sales loads, deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges
applicable to each class of shares of such portfolio in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares
in the portfolio are offered through the prospectus. Each portfolio will disclose the respective expenses and performance
data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the
statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the portfolio as a whole
generally and not on a per class basis. Each portfolio's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis
with respect to all classes of shares of such portfolio. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares in a portfolio, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares in each portfolio. The information provided
by a Fund for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of each portfolio's net asset value and public offering
price will present each class of shares separately.
14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted class will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or
service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that
in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the
conversion.

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its 12b-1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any
amendment of a Services Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares
under the plan, Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class unless the holders of Purchase Class
shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors of the Funds shall take such action as is
necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New
Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed
advisable by the directors of the Funds to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing
Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all
material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class
shares or New Purchase Class shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described
in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors of the Funds reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with Condition 4 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the adviser and the distributor
of the Fund. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares
subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class shares plan and the
relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.
16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that a Fund may make pursuant to a Plan
in reliance on the exemptive order.
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release
No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Heber J. Grant & Company; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



January 27, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANT:

 Heber J. Grant & Company.




RELEVANT ACT SECTION:

 Section 6(c).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicant, a privately held company substantially owned and controlled by one family and certain persons and entities
employed by, controlled by, affiliated with, or otherwise related to members of that family, seeks an exemption from
all provisions of the Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Heber J. Grant & Company, a Utah corporation, was organized in 1888 by its founder, Heber J. Grant, to consolidate
his various business interests into a single enterprise. Applicant operates as an insurance agency, engaged in both
wholesale activities as a general agent and as a retail agent selling directly to the public, through an 83.5 percent-owned
subsidiary. Applicant proposes to dispose of its insurance subsidiary, after which applicant's principal asset
would be investment securities.

2. Currently, there are 148,856 shares of applicant's common stock ($1.00 par value) outstanding, held by approximately
250 shareholders. During his lifetime, applicant's founder transferred or donated shares of applicant's stock
to family members, and to other parties. Applicant's stock has never been offered or sold to the public, and applicant
has not sold its shares to any person since before 1920. Of the issued and outstanding stock, 60.4 percent is held by
direct descendants of Heber J. Grant, their spouses, and 32 family trusts and one partnership for the exclusive benefit
of direct descendants of Heber J. Grant or their spouses and in which such persons collectively exercise sole voting
and dispositive power; 16.5 percent is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the ``LDS Church''),
for which Heber J. Grant served as president between 1919 and 1945; 13.7 percent is held by 66 present or former executive
employees of applicant, and the remaining 9.4 percent is held by 53 descendants of donees of Heber J. Grant. To the best
of applicant's knowledge, its stock has not been quoted in any active trading market, and no stock has been sold through
securities broker-dealers.

3. Applicant's transfer records for the past twelve years indicate that transfers of applicant's stock were made
as part of the estate planning of living shareholders, and as a result of the death of other shareholders and the transfer
of stock to descendants. Applicant believes that all of such transfers were made to family members of applicant's
founder, Heber J. Grant. In addition, all purchases and sales of applicant's stock noted in such transfer records
were executed among existing shareholders.

4. Five of the nine members of applicant's board of directors are direct descendants of Heber J. Grant. The other directors
consist of a high governing official of the LDS Church, former and current officers of applicant's subsidiary, and
a former president of a principal insurance customer of applicant's subsidiary that is the real estate arm of the LDS
Church.

5. For more than fifteen years, applicant has furnished annually to its shareholders consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Applicant intends to continue to provide
such annual financial statements to its shareholders. Such financial statements will not be audited because of the
small amount of the assets involved and the limited nature of applicant's operations.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act generally provides that an investment company includes any issuer that is engaged in
the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire
investment securities having a value exceeding 40 percent of the value of such issuer's total unconsolidated assets.
Applicant states that it currently is not subject to the Act because of the nature of the assets and operations conducted
by its insurance subsidiary. After applicant's disposal of its subsidiary, investment securities will constitute
applicant's principal assets. Accordingly, applicant may be subject to the Act.

2. Section 3(c)(1) of the Act excepts from the definition of ``investment company'' any issuer whose outstanding
securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons and which is not making, and does not presently propose
to make, a public offering of its securities. Applicant asserts that section 3(c)(1) was not intended to include ``private''
investment companies within the purview of the Act and that under section 6(c) the SEC may exempt private investment
companies that have more than 100 beneficial owners. See 

Maritime Corporation,

 9 SEC 906, 909 (1941). Applicant contends that its request for a conditional order under section 6(c) of the Act is consistent
with relief granted to other private investment companies substantially owned and controlled by a single family.


See, e.g., Bessemer Securities Corporation,

 Investment Company Act Release Nos. 18529 (notice) (Feb. 5, 1992) and 18594 (order) (March 3, 1992); 

Richardson Corporation,

 Investment Company Act Release Nos. 16566 (notice) (Sept. 22, 1988) and 16606 (order) (Oct. 21, 1988); 

5600, Inc.,

 Investment Company Act Release Nos. 16004 (notice) (Sept. 25, 1987) and 16067 (order) (Oct. 21, 1987). These orders
were issued subject to restrictions that ensured that the investment vehicles would remain family controlled, private
enterprises.

3. Applicant seeks a conditional order under section 6(c) of the Act to exempt it from all provisions of the Act and all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Applicant states that it is essentially a closely-held, private
company for which the protections provided to investors under the Act are not necessary or appropriate in the public
interest. Applicant represents that it does not seek additional capital through the sale of securities, but focuses
its investment strategy on preserving, protecting, and obtaining appreciation on the capital accumulated as a result
of the business activities of its founder during his lifetime. Applicant asserts that after disposition of its insurance
subsidiary, it will remain a private investment vehicle for the continuation of the business and investment principles
of its founder. Applicant states that it has not taken any steps to facilitate development of a trading market for applicant's
common stock, and that conditions 5 and 6, as stated below, ensure that applicant will continue to be at least 80 percent
owned by the categories of shareholders that currently hold applicant's stock.

4. Applicant states that, in accordance with the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act, it will adopt an amendment
to its articles of incorporation that will provide a corporate right of redemption tantamount to a right of refusal
in the event that an existing shareholder proposes to sell shares of applicant's stock to a person not included in the
category of shareholders described in condition 4. Applicant believes that this right of redemption will enable
applicant to maintain its essentially private nature.

5. Applicant believes that the requested exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.



Applicant's Conditions



If the requested relief is granted, applicants agree to the following conditions:

1. Applicant will continue to hold annual meetings of its stockholders for the purpose of electing directors and transacting
such other business as may properly come before such meetings.

2. Applicant will continue to furnish annually to its stockholders its financial statement prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, together with a brief description of the
business done by applicant during the most recent fiscal year which will, in the opinion of management, indicate the
general nature and scope of the business of applicant. Because of the small amount of assets involved and the limited
nature of applicant's operations, such financial statement will not be audited.
3. Applicant will not knowingly make available to any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 any financial information concerning applicant for the purpose of knowingly enabling that broker or dealer
to initiate any regular trading market for applicant's common stock.
4. Applicant will be at least 80 percent owned by or for the benefit of the direct descendants of Heber J. Grant and/or
their spouses; direct descendants of donees of Heber J. Grant; family trusts, estates, partnerships or corporations
established for the exclusive benefit of direct descendants of Heber J. Grant, direct descendants of donees of Heber
J. Grant, or their spouses and in which such persons collectively exercise sole voting and dispositive power; the
LDS Church or another tax-exempt religious or charitable institution as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended, controlled by or under common control with the LDS Church; and natural persons who, at the
time they receive an interest in applicant, are executive employees or former executive employees of applicant;
and any portion of applicant which is not owned by or for the benefit of these categories of shareholders will be beneficially
owned (as the term is used in section 3(c)(1) of the Act) by not more than 35 persons and will not have been publicly offered.
5. Applicant will limit the sale or other issuance of additional shares of common stock so that after such sale or other
issuance applicant will be in compliance with the last preceding condition.
6. Applicant will obtain approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of an amendment
to applicant's articles of incorporation granting to applicant a right of redemption in the event of a proposed sale
or other transfer by any shareholder of shares in applicant, except in the case of a proposed sale or other transfer
to direct descendants of Heber J. Grant and/or their spouses; direct descendants of donees of Heber J. Grant; family
trusts, estates, partnerships or corporations established for the exclusive benefit of direct descendants of Heber
J. Grant, direct descendants of donees of Heber J. Grant, or their spouses and in which such persons collectively exercise
sole voting and dispositive power; the LDS Church or another tax-exempt religious or charitable institution as defined
in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, controlled by or under common control with the LDS Church;
and natural persons who, at the time they receive an interest in applicant, are executive employees or former executive
employees of applicant.

Proposed Restructuring of Air Traffic Control Services; Meeting



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to the recommendations of the National Performance Review and the 1993 National Airline Commission,
the DOT is developing a proposal that could lead to restructuring FAA's air traffic control (ATC) services as a Government
corporation. Before drafting the related enabling legislation for Congressional consideration, the FAA invites
comments on various aspects of the corporation proposal. This notice announces a meeting at which the public is invited
to discuss a proposed restructuring of ATC services.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Participation at the Meeting



Attendance is open to the public but limited to the space available. Since access to the FAA building is controlled,
all persons who plan to attend the meeting must notify Margo Inskeep (202) 267-9227 prior to February 22.





Requests from persons who wish to present oral statements at the public meeting should be received by the FAA no later
than February 15, 1994. Such requests should be submitted to Margo Inskeep (as listed above in section titled 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

), and should include a written summary of oral remarks to be presented along with an estimate of time needed for the
presentation. Requests received after the date specified above will be scheduled if there is time available during
the meeting; however, the names of those individuals may not appear on the written agenda. The FAA will prepare an agenda
of speakers that will be available at the meeting. In order to accommodate as many speakers as possible, the amount
of time allocated to each speaker may be less than the amount of time requested.


Background 



In response to the recommendations of both the National Performance Review and the National Commission to Ensure
a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, an executive oversight committee, sponsored by the Secretary of Transportation,
is developing a detailed plan to restructure FAA's air traffic control services as a Government corporation. The
committee is developing a corporate structure that would streamline procurement, simplify the personnel process,
provide funding stability, and ensure continuity of leadership among the objectives. The committee is comprised
of senior officials from the Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget,
Council of Economic Advisers, National Economic Council, National Performance Review, and various other agencies.
Alternative proposals are an FAA corporation and an air traffic control corporation. The oversight committee is
soliciting suggestions and concerns regarding these proposals or any suggested alternatives.


Specific Issues for Public Comment


There are specific issues discussed in the following paragraphs on which the DOT's executive oversight committee
seeks comment at the public meeting. Identification of these key issues is intended to help focus public comment on
those areas which will be most useful in developing legislative proposals. However, comments at the meeting need
not be limited to these issues.

Safety Issues, including: How a restructured air traffic control system would be organized, operated and maintained
to best guarantee safety for the traveling public; the relationship between the proposed corporation and FAA with
respect to safety; and any other specific safety issues that must be managed in the formulation of a corporate structure.

Budget and Financial Issues, including: The source of revenues for the ATC corporation; the pricing structure; the
Government's role, if any, in ensuring sufficient revenues to cover the costs of the system; questions of financing
from the Aviation Trust Fund; liability for ATC-related-accidents; and DOD funding issues.

Procurement Issues, including: The procurement authorities the corporation should have and whether elements of
the Government's current procurement process (e.g., full and open competition, Brooks Act, etc.) should be retained.

Personnel Issues, including: The functions and placement of FAA employees, and which existing personnel rules and
principles, if any, should apply to the corporation.

Oversight and Governance Issues, including: How an ATC corporation should be governed; how it should be accountable
to the public and to Congress; who should oversee the ATC system; and what rulemaking and enforcement authorities
should rest with the corporation and what should remain with the FAA.

(1) There will be no admission fee or other charge to attend or to participate in the meeting. The meeting will be open
to all persons who have requested in advance to present statements and on a space-available basis to all those non-presentors
who notified FAA of their planned attendance prior to the day of the meeting. The meeting may adjourn early if scheduled
speakers complete their statements in less time than currently is scheduled for the meeting.

(2) An individual, whether speaking in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, may be
limited to a 10-minute statement, if required by time constraints. The speaker will be notified if additional time
is available.

(3) Every effort will be made to accommodate all speakers. If the available time does not permit this, speakers generally
will be scheduled based on when their request was received in the FAA.

(4) Sign interpretation will be available at the meeting.

(5) For record purposes, it is requested that one copy of presentation and hand-out materials be provided to the presiding
official by the presentor. In addition, materials may be distributed to the audience; however these copies must be
provided by the presentor.

(6) The DOT executive oversight committee will review and consider the material presented at the meeting.

(7) Statements made by the DOT official presiding over the meeting are intended to facilitate discussion or to clarify
issues. Any statement made during the meeting by the presiding official is not intended to be, and should not be construed
as, a position of the DOT or FAA.

(8) The meeting is designed to elicit public views and more complete information on the issues discussed in this notice.
Therefore, the meeting will be conducted in an informal and nonadversarial manner. No individual will be subject
to cross-examination by any other participant.

(9) A recorder will be present to document the meeting.

<DOCTITLE>Organizations, Functions, and Authority Delegations: Special Counsel and Director of Civil Penalty Adjudications</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of delegation of authority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA is giving notice of a new delegation of authority from the Administrator to the Special Counsel and Director
for Civil Penalty Adjudications regarding civil penalty actions under 14 CFR part 13, subpart G. The delegation was
set forth in a memorandum signed by the Administrator on October 22, 1993. The FAA is publishing the text of the delegation
so that it is available to interested parties. This delegation of authority does not affect the delegation of authority
by the Administrator to the Chief Counsel and the Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation signed by the Administrator
on October 27, 1992, and published in the 

Federal Register 

on December 9, 1992. 57 FR 58280; December 9, 1992.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In August, 1993, the position of Special Counsel and Director of Civil Penalty Adjudications was created. The duties
of the incumbent of that position include serving as an advisor to the FAA decisionmaker in appeals of initial decisions
and orders by administrative law judges in civil penalty actions under 14 CFR part 13, subpart G. In these proceedings,
the Administrator serves as the FAA decisionmaker.


By memorandum dated October 22, 1993, the Administrator delegated limited authority as FAA decisionmaker to the
Special Counsel and Director of Civil Penalty Adjudications. The delegation of authority was designed to eliminate
the need for the Administrator, acting in the capacity as FAA decisionmaker, to review and consider minor, procedural
or unopposed matters.
The Administrator delegated similar authority as FAA decisionmaker to the Chief Counsel and the Assistant Chief
Counsel for Litigation by memorandum dated October 27, 1992, and published in the 

Federal Register 

on December 9, 1992. 57 FR 58280; December 9, 1992. The delegation of authority to the Special Counsel and Director
of Civil Penalty Adjudications does not supercede or otherwise affect that delegation to the Chief Counsel and the
Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation.
In the October 27, 1992, memorandum, the Administrator delegated the authority to issue orders staying, pending
judicial review, orders of the FAA decisionmaker, and to consent to the entry of judicial stays regarding such orders.
That delegation was unnecessary because a final order of the FAA decisionmaker shall not be considered an order assessing
civil penalty if a petition for review is filed in an appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals in a timely manner. See 14 CFR
13.16(b)(4) and 13.233(j)(2). Consequently, since there is no need for that particular delegation, the Administrator
did not include that delegation in the memorandum dated October 22, 1993. Otherwise, the authority delegated to the
Chief Counsel and the Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation is identical to the authority delegated to the new Special
Counsel and Director of Civil Penalty Adjudications.
The text of the delegation of authority to the Special Counsel and Director of Civil Penalty Adjudications signed
by the Administrator on October 22, 1993, in pertinent part, is as follows: Under 49 U.S.C. 322(b) and 14 CFR 13.202,
I [David R. Hinson, Administrator] delegate to the Special Counsel and Director of Civil Penalty Adjudications the
authority of the FAA decisionmaker in all civil penalty actions under 14 CFR part 13, subpart G, as follows:
a. To grant or deny extensions of time to file briefs, petitions for reconsideration, motions, and replies to petitions
for reconsideration and motions; to grant or deny requests to file additional briefs; and to approve or disapprove
other deviations from, or requests for changes in, procedural requirements;
b. To correct typographical, grammatical and similar errors in the FAA decisionmaker's orders, and to make editorial
changes in those orders that do not involve substantive matters;

c. To issue orders dismissing appeals from initial decisions upon request of the appellant, or due to the withdrawal
of the complaint; to grant or deny motions to dismiss appeals from initial decisions, or to issue orders 

sua sponte

, for failure to file a timely appeal or failure to perfect an appeal;

d. To stay the effectiveness of decisions and orders pending reconsideration by the FAA decisionmaker;
e. To dismiss summarily petitions to reconsider or modify that are repetitious or frivolous;
f. To issue orders construing notices of appeal or other documents that meet the requirements for appeal briefs as
appeal briefs, and to set a date for the filing of a reply brief.
This delegation of authority does not affect the delegation of authority to the Chief Counsel and the Assistant Chief
Counsel for Litigation by memorandum dated October 27, 1992, signed by Thomas C. Richards, Administrator.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of publication.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This notice constitutes the required quarterly publication of an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders
in civil penalty cases. The FAA is publishing an index by order number, a subject-matter index, and case digests that
contain identifying information about the final decisions and orders issued by the Administrator. These indexes
and digests will increase the public's awareness of the Administrator's decisions and orders and will assist litigants
and practitioners in their research and review of decisions and orders that may have precedential value in a particular
civil penalty action. Publication of the index by order number, as supplemented by the subject matter index, ensures
that the agency is in compliance with statutory indexing requirements.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The Administrative Procedure Act requires Federal agencies to maintain and make available for public inspection
and copying current indexes containing identifying information regarding materials required to be made available
or published. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). In a notice issued on July 11, 1990, and published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 29148; July 17, 1990), the FAA announced the public availability of several indexes and summaries that provide
identifying information about the decisions and orders issued by the Administrator under the FAA's civil penalty
assessment authority and the rules of practice governing hearings and appeals of civil penalty actions. 14 CFR part
13, subpart G. The FAA maintains an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty actions organized
by order number and containing identifying information about each decision or order. The FAA also maintains a subject-matter
index, and digests organized by order number.


In a notice issued on October 26, 1990, the FAA published these indexes and digests for all decisions and orders issued
by the Administrator through September 30, 1990. 55 FR 45984; October 31, 1990. The FAA announced in that notice that
it would publish supplements to these indexes and digests on a quarterly basis (

i.e.,

 in January, April, July, and October of each year). The FAA announced further in that notice that only the subject-matter
index would be published cumulatively, and that both the order number index and the digests would be non-cumulative.

Since that first index was issued on October 26, 1990 (55 FR 45984; October 31, 1990), the FAA has issued supplementary
notices containing the quarterly indexes of the Administrator's civil penalty decisions as follows:




In the notice published on January 19, 1993, the Administrator announced that for the convenience of the users of these
indexes, the order number index published at the end of the year would reflect all of the civil penalty decisions for
that year. 58 FR 5044; 1/19/93. The order number indexes for the first, second, and third quarters would be non-cumulative.
As noted at the beginning of the digests, the digests do not constitute legal authority, and should not be cited or relied
upon as such. The digests are not intended to serve as a substitute for proper legal research. Parties, attorneys,
and other interested persons should always consult the full text of the Administrator's decisions before citing
them in any context.
The Administrator's final decisions and orders, indexes, and digests are available for public inspection and copying
at all FAA legal offices. (The addresses of the FAA legal offices are listed at the end of this notice.)
In addition, the Administrator's decisions and orders have been published by commercial publishers and are available
on computer databases. (Information about these commercial publications and computer databases is provided at
the end of this notice.)

Digests



(Current as of December 31, 1993) 




The digests of the Administrator's final decisions and orders are arranged by order number, and briefly summarize
key points of the decision. The following compilation of digests includes all final decisions and orders issued by
the Administrator from October 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993. The FAA will publish noncumulative supplements to this
compilation on a quarterly basis (e.g. April, July, October, and January of each year). 

These digests do not constitute legal authority, and should not be cited or relied upon as such. The digests are not
intended to serve as a substitute for proper legal research. Parties, attorneys, and other interested persons should
always consult the full text of the Administrator's decisions before citing them in any context. 



In the Matter of Raymond B. Strohl



Order No. 93-28 (10/20/93)





Further Briefing Ordered. 

The parties are directed to provide a full procedural history of the case and to brief the following issues: (1) Whether
the Administrator has jurisdiction; (2) whether the law judge has jurisdiction; (3) whether the order assessing
civil penalty issued by Complainant is valid given that Respondent filed a timely request for hearing; and (4) whether
the terms of any settlement agreement entered into by the parties eliminate the need for further proceedings. The
parties have 30 days to file their additional briefs. 



In the Matter of Mark Sweeney



Order No. 93-29 (10/20/93)





Failure to See and Avoid. 

The Administrator affirmed the law judge's decision finding that Respondent, the pilot of a float-equipped Cessna
206, failed to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid another aircraft when he struck the other aircraft from the
rear. Both aircrafts were on sightseeing tours for the same operator. Respondent knew that the other aircraft was
directly ahead of his and that both aircraft were heading for the same destination. No weather or mechanical problems
existed. Respondent should have changed his position in his seat or maneuvered his aircraft to see around any obstruction
blocking his line of vision. Respondent created a collision hazard by operating so close to the other aircraft. He
operated his aircraft in a careless or reckless manner. 



Circumstantial Evidence. 

Complainant could use circumstantial evidence to sustain its burden of proof. 



In the Matter of William S. Post



Order No. 93-90 (10/20/93)





Applicant's Personal Expenses Under the EAJA. 

The Administrator held that the applicant's own expenses incurred to attend the hearing in his case were not recoverable
under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). Nothing in  14.05 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, which discusses
allowable attorney fees and expenses, would lead one to conclude that an applicant's personal expenses may be recovered.
The expenses recoverable under the EAJA are those incurred by an ``attorney, agent, or expert witness representing
or appearing on behalf of the party.''



In the Matter of Shane Thomas Allen



Order No. 93-31 (10/20/93)





Reconsideration Denied. 

The Administrator denied Respondent's petition for reconsideration of FAA Order No. 93-23 (July 22, 1993).
Respondent failed to show that good cause existed to excuse his untimely appeal brief. The Administrator affirmed
his prior dismissal of Respondent's appeal.



In the Matter of Raul Nunez



Order No. 93-32 (10/20/93)





Reconsideration Granted. 

The Administrator granted Respondent's petition for reconsideration of FAA Order No. 93-92 (March 24, 1993).
The Administrator had dismissed Respondent's appeal for failure to file an appeal brief. Upon reexamination, the
Administrator found that Respondent's notice of appeal contained sufficient information to comply with the requirements
for an appeal brief. Respondent's notice of appeal was construed as an appeal brief. Respondent's notice of appeal
was construed as an appeal brief. Respondent's appeal was reinstated. Complainant was given 35 days to file a reply
brief.

Order No. 93-33 (11/18/93)





Withdrawal of Appeal. 

Respondent withdrew its notice of appeal. Respondent's appeal is dismissed.




In the Matter of Castle Aviation



Order No. 93-34 (11/23/93)






Dismissal of Appeal. 

Respondent failed to perfect its appeal by filing an appeal brief as required by 14 CFR 13.233(c). Respondent's appeal
is dismissed.




In the Matter of Steel City Aviation



Order No. 93-35 (11/23/93)






Dismissal of Appeal. 

Respondent failed to perfect its appeal by filing an appeal brief as required by 14 CFR 13.233(c). Respondent's appeal
is dismissed.




In the Matter of Valley Air Services, Inc.



Order No. 93-36 (12/21/93)






Allegation of Operating Without Timely Overhaul of Governors. 

The complaint alleged that Valley Air operated its aircraft when the propeller governors had not been overhauled
as required. Respondent's defense was that it had obtained a letter from the manufacturer extending the time between
overhaul, and that this letter was a valid ``maintenance instruction'' within the meaning of 14 CFR 135.421(b).




``Maintenance Instruction'' Defined. 

Maintenance instructions are general instructions that manufacturers are required to furnish to all operators,
and that operators in turn are required to obey. Maintenance instructions do not include either ``instructions''
issued to particular operators, or optional ``instructions.''




Manfuacturer's Letter of Extension Was Not A Maintenance Instruction. 

Contrary to the law judge's holding, the manufacturer's extension of time for overhaul of the propeller governors
was not a ``maintenance instruction'' within the meaning of Section 135.421. Woodward's extension of the time between
overhaul was issued to Respondent alone_not to all operators. Also, the effect of the letter was to 

relieve 

Respondent of the requirement to overhaul the governors at 1,800 hours.




Extension Was Not Retroactive. 

Even if the extension letter were found to be a maintenance instruction, Respondent had already flown the aircraft
103.5 hours past the 1,800-hour limit when the inspector discovered the problem. Thus, the rules had already been
violated when Respondent sought and obtained the extension letter from Woodward. Although Woodward may have intended
its purported extension to be retroactive, it simply did not have the power to exonerate Respondent from a pre-existing
violation of the rules.




Sanction. 

In light of all the circumstances of this case, including the uncontroverted evidence in the record that Respondent
had already flown its aircraft 103.5 hours past the 1,800-hour limit before the manufacturer was even contacted,
a sanction of $4,000 is appropriate.

In the Matter of Airspect, Inc.



Order No. 93-37 (12/21/93)





Interlocutory Appeal of Right Dismissed.

 Complainant's interlocutory appeal of the law judge's decision to accept Respondent's late-filed answer did not
meet the requirements for an interlocutory appeal of right pursuant to 14 CFR 13.219(c). The law judge's decision
did not violate 14 CFR 13.205(b) which provides a basis for an interlocutory appeals of right when a law judge exceeds
his powers. The Administrator dismissed Complainant's interlocutory appeal of right, and remanded the case of the
law judge for further proceedings.

Environmental Impact Statement: Fremont, Milpitas, California



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS), will prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to replace the Interstate 880 (I-880)/Dixon Landing Road Interchange
located in the cities of Fremont and Milpitas, Alameda, and Santa Clara Counties, respectively, California. The
existing 9.8m (32 ft.) wide 2-lane overcrossing will be replaced with a structure 34.1m (112 ft.) in width. The proposed
34.1m (112 ft.) wide structure will accommodate six (6) 3.7m (12 ft.) travel lanes (3 in each direction), a 4m (13 ft.)
weaving lane, two 1.5m (5 ft.) wide one-way bike lanes and a 1.2m (4 ft.) median.




In the northbound direction of the I-880, the existing hook off-ramp to California Circle, the loop off-ramp
to Dixon Landing Road, and the diagonal on-ramp from Dixon Landing Road will be modified such that there will be one
off-ramp and one on-ramp from I-880 to a collector distributor (CD) road. From the CD road there will be a hook
off-ramp to California Circle, a hook on-ramp from California Circle, a loop off-ramp to Dixon Landing Road, and a
diagonal on-ramp from Dixon Landing Road.


In the southbound direction of I-880, the existing diagonal off-ramp will be realigned and widened. The existing
hook on-ramp will be replaced with a loop on-ramp. A new existing diagonal on-ramp will be added south of the proposed
overcrossing. The proposed interchange improvement will accommodate the future widening of I-880 under consideration
by CALTRANS. The only alternative to the proposal under consideration is taking no action (No Project). Design refinements
will be considered to avoid or minimize environmental effects.


Project implementation would involve potential impact to wetlands and one endangered species. The existing and
proposed rights-of-way for the Dixon Landing Interchange project contain approximately 5.1ha (12.5 acres) of U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional seasonal wetlands. Since there is a species of concern (Salt Marsh) harvest
Mouse (

Reithrodontomys raviventris

), and other possible animals known to exist within the project existing and proposed rights-of-way, the proposed
project will be coordinated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance with the Endangered Species Act.

The proposed improvements are considered necessary to improve existing traffic operations and safety within the
Dixon Landing Road Interchange. The proposed improvements are also intended to provide for projected traffic demand
resulting from planned growth in population and employment within the cities of Fremont and Milpitas. The proposed
improvements would increase capacity of the overcrossing and maintain service levels within the Interchange at
LOS ``D'' or better.


Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have
interest in this proposal. A series of public information meetings will be held in Fremont and Milpitas between June
and July in 1994. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notices indicating the time and place of the meetings
and hearings will be published. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the
public hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time. 


To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments, and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation of Federal programs
and activities apply to this program)
