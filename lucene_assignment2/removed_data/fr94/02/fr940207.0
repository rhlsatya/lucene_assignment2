Minor Clarifying Amendments 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule corrects a number of minor typographical errors in NRC's regulations. These amendments are necessary
to inform the public of the administrative changes to the NRC regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The amendments presented in this final rule are necessary to correct a number of minor typographical errors in the
NRC's regulations. 


Because these amendments deal solely with agency practice and procedure, the notice and comment provisions of the
Administrative Act Procedure do not apply under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day
delay in the effective date because the amendments are of a minor and 
administrative nature. 


Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorial exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This final rule contains no information collection requirements and therefore is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 


Backfit Analysis 


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule, and therefore, that a
backfit analysis is not required for this final rule, because these amendments do not involve any provisions which
would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

Modification of Class E Airspace; Kotzebue, AK



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class E airspace at Kotzebue, AK, which corrects the legal description that inadvertently
eliminated the Class E surface area extensions during the Terminal Airspace Reconfiguration Amendment No. 71-16.
Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``control
zone,'' and airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is no operating control tower is now Class
E airspace. This action will provide adequate controlled airspace extending from the surface for aircraft executing
established standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP). The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to
provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



History



On September 2, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify
the Class E airspace at Kotzebue, AK (58 FR 46586). The proposal was to correct the legal description which inadvertently
eliminated the Class E surface area extensions during the Terminal Airspace Reconfiguration Amendment No. 71-16.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.

Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``control zone,''
and airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is no operating control tower is now Class E airspace.
This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace designations for controlled airspace areas
extending upward from the surface where there is no operating control tower are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1
(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.



The Rule



This Amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies Class E airspace at Kotzebue, AK, to provide
controlled airspace from the surface for IFR operations at the Kotzebue Airport at Kotzebue.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.



List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71



Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).



Adoption of the Amendment



In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows:

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action changes the names of two VHF Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) aids, and one VHF
Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) aid, within the airspace designations of certain
Class E airspace areas located in Oregon and Idaho. A navigational aid (NAVAID) with the same name as the airport should
be located on the airport. This action reflects the name changes, where necessary, of the NAVAID's that are not located
on the airport with which they are associated.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




History



On December 24, 1992, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to change
the names of three NAVAID's within the airspace designations of certain Class E airspace areas located in Oregon and
Idaho (57 FR 61343). FAA Handbook 7400.2 states that a NAVAID with the same name as the associated airport should be
located on the airport. Therefore, the names of the three NAVAID's associated with the airports, but not located on
the airport surfaces, were proposed to be changed. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting the proposal were received.
This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice, except: The coordinates for the Medford-Jackson County
Airport, Oregon, and the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport, Idaho, have been changed to reflect the latest data.
Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area'' and replaced it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' Other than that change in terminology, this amendment
is the same as that proposed in the notice. The coordinates in the proposal were North American Datum 27; however, these
coordinates have been updated to North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs
6002 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be subsequently
published in the order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations changes the names of two VORTAC's and one VOR/DME within
certain Class E airspace designations in the states of Oregon and Idaho. A NAVAID with the same name as the airport should
be located on the airport. This action reflects the name changes, where necessary of the NAVAID's that are not located
on the airport with which they are associated.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs, contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``major
rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final Rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument rules at the affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.


Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the US Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and
safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable,
and contrary to the public interest and where applicable that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in
less than 30 days.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``major
rule'' under Executive Order 12291; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact
is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</USDEPT>





Acquisition Regulation; Environmental Protection 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) issues a final rule which amends the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR)
to provide coverage on environmental protection for contractors operating DOE facilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background
II. Section-by-Section Analysis 
III. Public Comments 
IV. Procedural Requirements 


I. Background 


In this rule the Department of Energy wishes to more clearly communicate the importance of the protection of the environment,
and it wishes to enhance compliance with applicable environmental protection laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations
by contractors operating facilities of the Department. To accomplish this, a new clause, Environmental Protection,
to be included in DOE contracts was proposed in a notice of proposed rulemaking, published in the August 28, 1991, 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 42584), and is now promulgated in this final rule. 


II. Section-by-Section Analysis 


Section 970.5204-62 and 970.2303-2(e) provide a clause and clause prescription for the use of the clause,
Environmental Protection. To the list of environmental laws and Executive Orders appearing in the proposed rule
have been added entries at 970.5204-62(a)(3), at (a)(15) to (a)(19) and at (b)(12) and (b)(13). These refer
to laws and Executive Orders that have become effective since the time the proposed rule was developed or that were
overlooked at the time the proposed rule was developed. 


III. Public Comments 


a. General 


DOE invited interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments with respect
to the DEAR amendments set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking. Comments were received from 8 business firms
and universities, many of which are DOE management and operating contractors. 


b. Safety and Permits 


Comments were received regarding the proposed coverage on the clause at proposed DEAR 970.5204-2, Safety and
Health (Government-owned or -leased facility), and the clause at proposed DEAR 970.5204-29, Permits or Licenses.
In part DOE agrees with some of the comments offered and for these and other reasons has decided not to amend the DEAR
coverage on these two clauses at this time. Also, conforming amendments, related to the two clauses, at proposed DEAR
970.2303-2(a) and 970.7104-21 will not be made at this time. Should the Department decide to revise these
clauses in the future, a notice of proposed rulemaking would be issued. 


c. Environmental Protection 


</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940207-0-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940207-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Comments were offered that the changes in the proposed rule were burdensome, would have an adverse impact on operations,
and would require a significant increase in administrative and oversight effort for no apparent effort. Another
comment noted a tendency to formalize good management practices into rigid contractual requirements that can only
have the long-run effect of limiting the ability of management and operating contractors to respond innovatively
and creatively to changing conditions. Administration of clause requirements has been substantially reduced by
the deletion of requirements from the proposed Environmental Protection clause in paragraphs, at proposed DEAR
970.5204-60(c) (1), (2) and (3). These involved the need for a contractor to research laws on an ongoing basis,
identify any inconsistencies that would affect performance, and to include consideration of environmental laws
in planning. 


d. Effects of Funding on Compliance 


A comment was received stating that the rule did not recognize the significant joint management relationship between
DOE and its management and operating contractors, that funding for compliance is controlled by DOE, that pre-existing
conditions preclude strict and immediate or near-term compliance in most DOE facilities, and they create ambiguity
as to an established baseline for compliance. Another comment stated that it was not clear how the provisions of the
avoidable cost rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 19, 1991 (56 FR 28099), relate to the proposed rule; it did not appear that a management and operating contractor
would have sole and exclusive control of the required compliance actions. Resolution of these comments is outside
the scope of this rule. It is appropriate for a contract to provide for compliance with applicable laws for which DOE
has some enforcement responsibility role. It is also the case that a management and operating contractor's obligation
to perform under a contract is contingent upon funds being obligated under the contract. Problems related to insufficient
funding to comply with the law are best resolved on a case-by-case basis. 


e. Paperwork Burden 


Several commenters perceived that an additional paperwork burden would be imposed by the proposed rule. The Department
does not believe that this rulemaking imposes material additional paperwork burden. The primary basis for this conclusion
is as follows: to the extent that any paperwork burden exists, such requirements are already contained in state and
Federal environmental laws and their implementing regulations, and thus do not result from this rule. Since current
management and operating contracts state that work under the contract must be performed in compliance with applicable
laws, and since the effect of the rule is simply to clarify that the requirements of all applicable environmental laws
and regulations are not waived for contractors (by virtue of the fact that work is being performed for the Government
under contract), the rule contains no material ``new'' requirements and therefore, no additional paperwork is required.
The Department believes that the public comments on additional paperwork burden may reflect a new awareness on the
part of some contractors that DOE has undergone a shift in its emphasis on environmental protection. To the extent
that the rulemaking does impose information collection or recordkeeping requirements, they have been provided
for under Office of Management and Budget paperwork clearance package No. 1910-0300. 


f. Environmental Protection 


Several commenters expressed concern over the identification of laws, codes, ordinances, regulations, and directives
by which DOE intends to monitor compliance. It was said that the proposed rulemaking appeared to shift the burden of
identifying and complying with environmental laws and regulations from the contractor to the Government. If the
Government failed to list a specific law or regulation, it could call into question whether or not the contractor is
obligated to comply. In response to these comments the Environmental Protection clause at paragraph (a)(21) has
been revised to state, ``errors in or omissions from the list of laws above, or failure to identify a requirement having
the force and effect of law, shall not be construed as waiving a requirement for the contractor to comply with such law
or requirement nor shall they form the basis for a defense by the contractor in an administrative, civil, or criminal
proceeding. * * *'' 
Comments were offered that the Environmental Protection clause, now at paragraphs (a)(20) and (a)(21), is open-ended
and permits DOE to unilaterally modify a contract by incorporating as-yet unpublished directives into the contract.
Because of the special nature of environmental protection Directives, it is appropriate that DOE have the right to
require compliance with them by its management and operating contractors. This provision is not unlike that in the
Safety and Health (Government Owned or Leased Facility) clause (DEAR 970.5204-2) and the Security clause (DEAR
952.204-2). If there is a persuasive reason why a management and operating contractor should not comply with
a requirement in a Directive, this can be a topic of discussion during the negotiation of a contract or at any time during
the performance of the contract. 


IV. Procedural Requirements


a. Regulatory Review
b. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
c. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
d. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act

e. Review Under Executive Order 12612 
f. Review Under Executive Order 12778 


a. Regulatory Review 


This regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and 
Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not 
subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs. 


b. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 


Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR 
1500-1508), the Department has established guidelines for its compliance with 
the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Pursuant to Appendix A of Subpart D of 10 CFR Part 
1021, National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures, the 
Department of Energy has determined that this rule is categorically excluded 
from the need to prepare an environmental impact statement or environmental 
assessment. 


c. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 


To the extent that new information collection or recordkeeping 
requirements are imposed by this rulemaking they are provided for under 
Office of Management and Budget paperwork clearance package No. 1910-0300. 


d. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public 
Law 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis 
for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. This rule will have no impact on 
interest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or 
other direct economic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic 
consequences, such as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this 
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been 
prepared. 


e. Review Under Executive Order 12612 


Executive Order 12612, entitled ``Federalism,'' 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 
1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy 
actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the 
relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. 
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order 
requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions 
involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This rule will not 
affect States substantially. 


f. Review Under Executive Order 12778 


Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency subject to 
Executive Order 12291 to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new 
regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth 
in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless 
ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear 
and certain legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promoting 
simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make 
every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: Specifies clearly any 
preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and 
retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available 
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such 
administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that this 
rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and 2(b) of Executive Order 
12778.
