Avoca Natural Gas Storage; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Avoca Gas Storage
Field Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues 



February 1, 1994. 



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Avoca
Gas Storage Field Project.

1

 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project. 





Summary of the Proposed Project 



Avoca Natural Gas Storage (Avoca) wants Commission authorization to construct and operate a new underground natural
gas storage field near the town of Avoca in Steuben County, New York. Avoca proposes to solution mine 10 caverns out
of a bedded salt formation. The caverns would have 6.72 billion cubic feet (BCF) of storage capacity (5 BCF working
gas capacity). Avoca would construct the following facilities to use these caverns for natural gas storage: 

 10 solution-mined cavern wells; 

 3 water source wells; 

 6 brine disposal wells; 

 5,100 feet of 20-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline; 

 900 feet of 24-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline; 

 7,000 feet of 12-inch-diameter water withdrawal pipeline; 

 15,400 feet of 12-inch-diameter water injection pipeline; 

 15,400 feet of 12-inch-diameter brine return pipeline; 

 25,600 feet of 12-inch-diameter brine disposal pipeline; 

 15,400 feet of 2-inch-diameter diesel injection pipeline; 

 A new 25,000-horsepower compressor station; 

 An electric-motor driven pumping station (leach plant); 

 A 0.23-acre, double-lined, brine settling pond; 

 Gas dehydration facilities; and 

 Storage tanks for coolant water, glycol, lube oil, hydrocarbons, methanol, and diesel fuel. 



Schedule 



Avoca would develop the proposed project in three stages (referred to below as Phase 1, 2, and 3) over a period of 3 to
4 years. 

Phase 1 would include the construction of all solution mining, gas handling, water production, and brine disposal
facilities. Phase 1 would also include the development and operation of four storage caverns_with approximately
2 BCF of storage capacity. Completion of Phase 1 would take about 18 to 20 months. 

Phase 2 would include the development of four additional storage caverns (another 2 BCF of storage capacity). 

Phase 3 would include the development of the final 2 caverns (with 1 BCF of storage capacity). Phases 2 and 3 would each
take about 1 year to complete. 

The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1.

2

 





Land Requirements for Construction 



Avoca would use 200 acres of land for the Avoca Gas Storage Field Project. Of this total, 60 acres are associated with
surface facilities such as the well pads, leach plant, compressor station, and brine ponds. The remaining 140 acres
would be disturbed by activities related to gas, water supply, and brine disposal pipelines. Any temporary work areas,
storage yards, etc., would be contained within the area designated for gas handling facilities.

<TEXT>
 

Following completion of construction, approximately 70 of the total 200 acres would be allowed to revert to preconstruction
conditions. 

Avoca proposes to use a 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way for its gas, water, and brine pipelines. Avoca's
permanent rights-of-way for the pipelines outside the site property would vary from 25 to 50 feet wide, depending
on the number of pipelines in the easement: 25 feet wide for single pipelines and 50 feet wide for multiple pipelines.




The EA Process 



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. 

The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings: 

 Geology and soils; 

 Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands; 

 Vegetation and wildlife; 

 Endangered and threatened species; 

 Land use; 

 Cultural resources; 

 Air quality and noise; 

 Hazardous waste. 

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project. 



Currently Identified Environmental Issues 



We have already identified several environmental issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review
of the proposed facilities and the information provided by Avoca. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The
list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. 

The list of environmental issues: 

 Avoca would drill a total of 19 new wells in Steuben County, New York: 10 solution-mined cavern, 3 water source,
and 6 brine disposal wells. These facilities have a potential for groundwater and surface impact. 

 Whether the structural geology of the area is sufficient to contain solution-mined caverns. 

 Avoca proposes to use 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for the solution-mining process during the first 2
years of operation at the Avoca Gas Storage Field. This may have an impact on groundwater availability. Testing of
wells in the local aquifers indicate that the water supply recharges up to 14,600,000 gallons of water per day. 

 Avoca's pipelines would cross two perennial streams: Neils Creek and Cotton Creek. Both of these creeks are
high-quality trout streams, classified as trout-spawning grounds by New York. 

 Avoca's brine disposal pipelines would cross 16 wetlands. 

 Avoca would construct a new compressor station and pumping facility. The nearest noise-sensitive area to
Avoca's new compressor station and pumping facility is 2,400 feet to the northeast. There is the potential for air
and noise quality impacts. 

 Possible impact on federally listed threatened or endangered species. 

 Possible impact on cultural resources. 



Public Participation 



You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You
should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. 

Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., NE., Washington, DC 20426; 

 Reference Docket No. CP94-161-000; 

Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol St., NE. room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and 

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before March 1, 1994. 

If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Grape at the above address. 



Becoming an Intervenor 



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 



Additional Questions? 



Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, at (202)

<DOCTITLE>Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


February 1, 1994.


Take notice that on January 24, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) tendered for filing as part
of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Original Sheet No. 22, effective December 1, 1993.
Natural states that the purpose of the filing is to reinstate, for the last ten months of fiscal year 1994 only, a separate
Annual Charges Adjustment (ACA) charge for service provided on the facilities formerly owned and operated by Moraine
Pipeline Company (Moraine). Natural states that the Commission approved the abandonment by Moraine and the acquisition
by Natural of the Moraine facilities by order issued September 22, 1993 at Docket No. CP93-351-000 (September
22nd Order). The September 22nd Order required Natural to establish a separate incremental Part 284 rate and adopt
as initial rates Moraine's existing rates for transportation on the acquired facilities.
Natural also states that it previously filed and the Commission accepted rates for the Moraine facilities that did
not include the ACA charge sought here. Such earlier filing was without prejudice to the then pending Request for Waiver
of Payment of Annual Charges filed by Moraine on August 10, 1993 at Docket No. RM87-3-024. Subsequently,
on January 6, 1994, the Commission issued an order denying Moraine's requested waiver of payment of ACA charges. Therefore,
Natural further states that it should be afforded the opportunity to equitably recoup the entire ACA charges amount
that was previously billed by the Commission and paid by Moraine; and as such, it is filing to reinstate effective December
1, 1993, the ACA charge of $.0026 per Mcf which had been previously filed by Moraine and accepted by Commission order
to be effective October 1, 1993.
Natural states that it requested waiver of the Commission's Regulations to the extent necessary for the sheet to become
effective December 1, 1993. Natural also states that the acceptance of the tariff sheet is consistent with the September
22nd Order.
Natural states that a copy of the filing was mailed to Natural's jurisdictional customers, intervenors in Docket
No. CP93-351-000 and interested state regulatory agencies.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before February
8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference
room.

68124-1000, filed in Docket No. CP94-200-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 of the Commission's
Regulations to construct and operate a new delivery point for West Texas Gas Inc. (West Texas) to serve new residential
service to a trailer court in Gray County, Texas under Northern's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-401-000,
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and
open to public inspection. 
Northern proposes to construct and operate one small measuring station and appurtenant facilities (Conklin Master
Meter) to provide increased natural gas deliveries to West Texas pursuant to Northern's existing transportation
service agreement under Northern's currently effective Rate Schedules to serve a trailer court downstream of the
Conklin Master Meter located in Gray County, Texas. Northern states that the estimated peak day volumes to be delivered
to West Texas is 69.6 Mcf of natural gas per day and 2,270 Mcf of natural gas per year. Northern states that the estimated
cost to install these facilities is $1,000. Northern states that the volumes to be delivered to West Texas at this delivery
point after the request would not exceed the total volumes authorized prior to the request. Northern states that the
establishment of this delivery point is not prohibited by Northern's existing tariff and Northern has sufficient
capacity to accomplish deliveries at this new delivery point without detriment or disadvantage to Northern's other
customers. 
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders; 
Week of November 1 Through November 5, 1993 




During the week of November 1 through November 5, 1993, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.





Appeals 



Natural Resources Defense Council, 11/1/93 

LFA-0150

 




The Natural Resources Defense Council filed an Appeal from a denial by the Office of Military Application of a request
for information that it filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the information that was
withheld as classified material under Exemption 3 of the FOIA, after a review by the DOE's Office of Classification,
the DOE determined that a small portion of previously withheld material could now be released as the result of more
precise deletions. The remaining withheld material continues to be properly classified, and therefore, may not
be released. Accordingly, the Appeal was granted in part and denied in part.





Valley Times, 11/1/93, 

LFA-0325






Valley Times filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of a request for information
which the company had submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. In considering the Appeal, the
DOE found that the names of certain former Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory employees who were under investigation
by the OIG for possible conflict of interest violations were improperly withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) and that
the names should be released to the public. On remand, the OIG must release the names of the subject of its conflict of
interest investigation or explain why it is inappropriate to do so.

Refund Applications 



Gulf Oil Corporation/New York Telephone Co., 

11/4/93, 

RR300-252




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning a Motion for Reconsideration filed in the Gulf Oil Corporation special
refund proceeding by Allin M. Means, President of Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI), on behalf of the New York Telephone
Co. In its Motion, RRI requested reconsideration of an April 13, 1993 Decision and Order that dismissed NY Telephone's
refund Application on the ground that it was filed after the March 1, 1993 deadline for submissions in the Gulf proceeding.
See Gulf Oil Corp./Bresett, 

23 DOE  85,031 (1993). 
In considering RRI's Motion, the DOE determined that RRI had not presented any compelling reason that would warrant
acceptance of the late Application. In addition, the DOE determined that RRI's conduct in connection with the Application
did not meet the standards applicable to participants in agency proceedings. Accordingly, the DOE determined that
RRI should take specified remedial measures designed to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct in question. Accordingly,
the Motion for Reconsideration was denied, and RRI was ordered to take the specified measures.






Texaco Inc./ 
Yankee Oil Co., Inc.; 
F.L. Roberts & Co., Inc.,

 11/4/93, 

RF321-17264, RF321-19930

 


The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by the sole shareholders of Yankee Oil
Co., Inc. (Yankee), and modified a refund previously granted to F.L. Roberts & Co., Inc. (Roberts). In August
1978, Yankee had sold some of its assets, including its supply contract with Texaco, to Roberts. In considering the
Yankee claim, the DOE found that Roberts had been granted a refund based upon purchases of Texaco products made by Yankee
prior to May 1976. Roberts conceded that it was not eligible for a refund based upon these purchases but argued that
it was eligible for a refund based upon purchases made after April 1976, when Yankee signed a supply contract with Texaco.
The DOE held that the right to a refund is an asset separate from the supply contract and was not transferred to Roberts
by the transfer of the supply contract. However, Roberts was eligible for a refund based upon Texaco products purchased
beginning in August 1978. Therefore the Roberts refund was reduced by the amount of the refund it had incorrectly received
in an earlier Decision. As a result, Roberts was granted a refund of $11,381 ($8,300 principal plus $3,081 interest).
Yankee was granted a refund of $48,206 ($35,156 principal plus $13,050 interest) based upon purchases made from March
1973 until August 1978.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Issuance of Proposed Decision and Order; Week of December 6 Through December 10, 1993 </DOCTITLE>



During the week of December 6 through December 10, 1993, the proposed decision and order summarized below was issued
by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to an application for exception. 

Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR Part 205, Subpart D), any person who
will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection
within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be
the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first.


The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time
period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in
final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in the proposed decision and order must also
file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In
the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in
any further proceeding involving the exception matter. 

Copies of the full text of this proposed decision and order are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, room 1E-234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585,
Monday through Friday, between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., except federal holidays.

During the week of December 13 through December 17, 1993, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to applications for relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following
summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. 



Whistleblower Proceeding 



Ronald Sorri, 12/16/93, LWA-0001




Ronald Sorri (Sorri) filed a request for a hearing on June 9, 1993 under the Department of Energy's Contractor Employee
Protection Program, 10 C.F.R. Part 708. This case involved a whistleblower complaint filed by Sorri under DOE's new
Contractor Employee Protection Program, charging that reprisals were taken against him after he raised safety concerns
with Sandia National Laboratories, DOE, and Congressman Leon Panetta. The alleged reprisals included removing
him from his job as a maintenance technician in Sandia's Microelectronics Development Laboratory; giving him lowered
performance ratings; reassigning him to a job as a technical writer; and finally, firing him. DOE's Office of Contractor
Employee Protection (OCEP) investigated the complaint and found that the first three actions were reprisals for
Sorri's disclosure of safety concerns. However, OCEP concluded the Sorri's termination did not constitute a reprisal.
Sorri requested a hearing before a Hearing Officer with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, maintaining that his termination
was also a reprisal for his safety disclosures. The Hearing Office concluded that Sorri proved by a preponderance
of the evidence that he engaged in activities protected under Part 708 and that these activities were a contributing
factor in the decision by Sandia and L&M to terminate his employment. The Hearing Officer further concluded that
Sandia and L&M failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they would have terminated Sorri's employment
were it not for his whistleblowing activities. The Hearing Officer therefore determined that Sorri's termination
violated the whistleblower regulations in 10 C.F.R. Part 708. Sorri was awarded $5,000 in back pay, plus attorney's
fees and costs. Sandia and L&M have the right to appeal the Decision to the Secretary or her designee. 



Motion for Discovery 

 


Oxy USA Inc., 12/17/93, LRD-0006, LRH-0002

 


OXY USA Inc. (OXY) filed Motions for Discovery and Evidentiary Hearing in connection with the firm's Statement of
Objections to a February 1992 Revised Proposed Remedial Order (the Revised PRO) issued to the firm by the DOE's Economic
Regulatory Administration (ERA). The Revised PRO concerns reciprocal crude oil transactions entered into by OXY's
predecessor in interest, Cities Service Company (Cities). Those transactions generally involved the sale by Cities
of price-controlled crude oil in exchange for its receipt of deeply discounted exempt crude oil. The ERA alleges that
Cities' reporting of these transactions violated the entitlements reporting requirements set forth at 10 C.F.R.
 211.67(b), (h), and (j) and the anti-circumvention rule set forth at 10 C.F.R.  205.202. 

In considering the firm's discovery requests, the DOE found that, with the exception of privileged material, OXY
had already been provided with information relevant to the charges in the Revised PRO. Accordingly, the discovery
motion was denied. In considering the firm's evidentiary hearing motion, the DOE held that OXY should be granted an
evidentiary hearing to support its contentions that (i) Cities' officials believed, and had a plausible basis for
believing, that entitlements-exempt uses, rather than miscertification, explained the transactions and (ii)
the transactions were not shams. The DOE denied OXY's request for an evidentiary hearing on the issues of the scope
of Cities' court action concerning the transactions and the sufficiency of Cities' contemporaneous disclosure
concerning the transactions, on the ground that those issues should be resolved on the basis of the record of the litigation
and submissions by Cities to the DOE. Accordingly, the evidentiary hearing motion was granted in part.

Refund Applications 



Atlantic Richfield Company/Mission Trail Oil Company, 12/15/93, RF304-3079




The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Mission Trail Oil Company (Mission
Trail) in the Atlantic Richfield Company Subpart V special refund proceeding. Mission Trail is affiliated with Coast
Oil Company (Coast), a firm that previously received a full small purchaser refund of $5,000 in principal in the ARCO
proceeding. In the case of multiple refund applications filed by affiliated firms in the same proceeding, the submissions
are consolidated in considering the applicants' eligibility for a refund. Therefore, the Mission Trail refund was
calculated based upon the consolidated Mission Trail and Coast volumes under the mid-range presumption less the
previous refund of $5,000 that had been granted to Coast. Thus Mission Trail was granted a refund of $9,194, representing
$5,463 in principal and $3,731 in interest.





Gulf Oil Corporation/ M.A. and M.T. Moon, 12/17/93, RF300-16446




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted in the Gulf Oil Corporation special
refund proceeding by Resource Refunds, Inc. on behalf of M.A. and M.T. Moon, operators of Moon and Sons Gulf. Under
Case No. RF300-10430, Gary Towerville, manager of Moon and Sons Gulf and stepson of M.A. Moon, previously applied
for and received a refund based on estimated purchases of 2,569,360 gallons. This Application for Refund was granted
in full on November 9, 1989. Under the Case No. RF300-16446, Resource Refunds, Inc. filed an Application for
Moon and Sons Gulf, claiming that the station should receive a refund based on 2,703,870 gallons. This Application
incorrectly stated that the applicant had not previously filed for a refund in this proceeding. Because the second
Application claimed a refund for 2,569,360 gallons previously included in the earlier filing, it therefore was granted
for purchases of only 134,510 gallons. Furthermore, this Decision discusses the responsibility of filing agents
to maintain the accuracy of their case files, and it reminded Resource Refunds, Inc. of this obligation.



 

Gulf Oil Corp./Ripley & Fletcher Co. RF300-14073, C.N. Brown Co., 12/15/93, RF300-16858




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two affiliated Applications for Refund filed by Wilson, Keller &
Associates, Inc. in the Gulf Oil Corporation special refund proceeding. In the first application, Ripley & Fletcher
Co. (Ripley) claimed a refund as a reseller based on the purchase of 193,564,655 gallons of Gulf petroleum product.
In the second application, C.N. Brown Co. (CNB) claimed a refund based on its purchase of 8,623,679 gallons under consignment.
As both applicants were under common ownership and control during the Gulf refund period, they were considered together
and approved for the maximum principal amount of $50,000 under the 40 percent presumption. Ripley and CNB could not
take advantage of the consignee presumption because it would have raised their combined principal amount beyond
the $50,000 limit and both applicants had chosen not to prove injury. Accordingly, the DOE granted Ripley a refund
of $86,250 ($48,000 principal plus $38,250 interest and CNB a refund of $3,594 ($2,000 principal and $1,594 interest).



 

Gulf Oil Corporation/Southern Jersey Airways, Inc., 12/17/93, RF300-19732




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted in the Gulf Oil Corporation special
refund proceeding by LK, Inc. (LK), a filing agency, on behalf of Southern Jersey Airways, Inc. (Southern). In considering
the refund claim, the DOE noted that LK was authorized to represent Southern, a firm in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, by the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. The DOE found that this arrangement would provide restitution
to Southern's estate. Accordingly, a refund in the amount of $7,716 was granted to LK, which will notify the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court of its receipt of the refund.

 Gulf Oil Corporation/Transportation Supplies, Inc., 12/15/93, RF300-16200



The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed in the Gulf Oil Corporation special
refund proceeding by Stanley Cofall on behalf of Transportation Supplies, Inc. (TSI). The Application for Refund
was submitted by Energy Refunds, Inc., a private filing service. The applicant claimed that TSI purchased 28,243,240
gallons of Gulf petroleum products and asked that the refund check be made payable to Stanley Cofall. Mr. Cofall could
not demonstrate that he was presently eligible to receive a refund on behalf of this corporation. In addition, under
Case No. RF300-10119, Leaseway Transportation Corporation was granted a refund based on purchases of 40,933,031
gallons of Gulf products made by the corporation and its subsidiaries which include Transportation Supplies, Inc.
Mr. Cofall was therefore denied a refund in this proceeding.

 


Gulf Oil Corporation/West Penn Power Company, 12/17/94, RF300-20131 



The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted in the Gulf Oil Corporation special
refund proceeding by West Penn Power Company. In considering the claim, the DOE noted that pursuant to Pennsylvania
regulations for public utilities, West Penn Power Company did not employ a monthly fuel adjustment clause during
the refund period. The DOE found that the company therefore could not pass through Gulf's alleged overcharges to its
customers on a dollar for dollar basis. Accordingly, West Penn Power Company was treated as an end-user in this proceeding
and was granted a total refund of $9,238. 






Quantum Chemical Corp./Wilcox Oil Company, 12/17/94, RR330-1 



Bill T. Wilcox submitted a Motion for Reconsideration of the DOE's denial of an Application for Refund that he had submitted
on behalf of Wilcox Oil Company (WOC) in the Quantum Chemical Corporation Refund proceeding. In its denial of the original
application, the DOE found that the WOC was a corporation whose stock had been sold, and that the right to a refund had
transferred to the purchaser of the stock. However, based on information submitted by Mr. Wilcox in his Motion for
Reconsideration, the DOE found that the WOC functioned as a sole proprietorship of Mr. Wilcox prior to its incorporation.
Accordingly, the DOE found that Mr. Wilcox was the proper recipient of a refund for WOC's purchases from Quantum that
occurred prior to the incorporation of WOC in December 1979. Mr. Wilcox was therefore granted a refund of $109.



 Texaco Inc./Ronnie's Texaco et al., 12/15/93, RF321-14226 et al. 



The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning seven Applications for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. Subpart V special
refund proceeding. The application for purchases made by Art Cement Products, Inc. (Art) (Case No. RF321-16588),
was filed by RECOLL Management Corp. (RECOLL). Art is in bankruptcy, and the New Bank of New England is one of its creditors.
RECOLL is acting on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank's receiver. The trustee in the Art
bankruptcy case stated that the bank has a security interest in all of Art's assets, and he requested that the refund
due Art be made payable to RECOLL. The DOE has previously indicated that where a firm is in bankruptcy, the refund will
be paid to a creditor if the creditor demonstrates a clear right to the refund. See Texaco Inc./General Gas & Oil
Co.

, 22 DOE   85,130 (1992). That is the case here. Accordingly, Art's refund was granted to RECOLL.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of December 27 Through December 31, 1993</DOCTITLE>

 



During the week of December 27 through December 31, 1993, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.




Appeals 






Armor Elevator Company, Inc., 12/28/93, LFA-0340 




Armor Elevator Company, Inc., filed an Appeal from a denial by the Batavia Area Office of a Request for Information
which the firm had submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE found
that the requested documents were not agency records because Batavia neither created nor obtained the material.
Important issues that were considered in the Decision and Order were (i) whether the contractor responsible for maintaining
and operating a government location is considered an agency for purposes of the FOIA and (ii) the test for classification
as an agency record.




Cynthia Ann Virostek, 12/29/93, LFA-0342 




Cynthia Ann Virostek filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the Office of the Executive Secretariat (OES)
of the DOE, in response to a request for information submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In its determination,
the OES released a letter requested by Virostek but stated that the enclosures to the letter could not be located. In
her Appeal, Virostek challenged the adequacy of this determination. The letter requested by Virostek was authored
by Robert Seamans, the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and was addressed
to the Chairman of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), who had submitted a draft report to ERDA and requested its
views. The enclosures to the letter were not stand-alone documents but were created as part of ERDA's response to the
NRC, solely for the purpose of supplementing with greater detail the view set forth in the body of the letter. In considering
the Appeal, the DOE found that because of the nature of the enclosures, the search performed by the OES through the archives
of files of the ERDA Administrator was reasonably calculated to uncover the material sought by the appellant. Accordingly,
Virostek's Appeal was denied.




Government Accountability Project, 12/27/93, LFA-0341 




The Government Accountability Project (GAP) filed an Appeal from a denial of a waiver of fees by the Director of the
Office of Communications of the Richland Field Office (Richland) of the DOE. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found
that while whistleblower litigation did not constitute a ``commercial interest'' under the fee waiver statute,
neither did it automatically satisfy the public interest requirement of the statute. The Appeal was remanded to Richland
to determine whether any of the information to be disclosed met the public interest requirement of the fee waiver statute.




Refund Applications 



The Office of Hearings and Appeals issued the following Decisions and Orders concerning refund applications, which
are not summarized. Copies of the full texts of the Decisions and Orders are available in the Public Reference Room
of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern), DOE.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Southeastern proposes to replace Rate Schedules CC-1-C, CK-1-B, CM-1-B, CBR-1-B,
CEK-1-B, CSI-1-B, and CTV-1-B currently applicable to Cumberland Basin Projects
power and seeks approval of new Rate Schedules CC-1-D, CK-1-C, CM-1-C, CBR-1-C,
CEK-1-C, CSI-1-C, and CTV-1-C, for a 5-year period July 1, 1994, through June 30,
1999. 



Opportunities will be available for interested persons to review the present rates, to review the proposed rates
and supporting studies, to participate in a public forum and to submit written comments. Southeastern will evaluate
all comments received in this process.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by order issued September 26, 1989, in Docket No. EF89-3021-000
confirmed and approved Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR-1-B, CSI-1-B, CM-1-B,
CC-1-B, CK-1-B, CTV-1-B, and CC-1-C, applicable to Cumberland Basin
Projects' power for the period July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1994.




DISCUSSION: 

Existing rate schedules for the present Cumberland System are predicated upon a May 1989 repayment study and other
supporting data all of which is contained in FERC Docket No. EF89-3021-000. The current repayment study
prepared in January of 1994 for the combined Cumberland System shows that existing rates are not adequate to recover
all costs required by present repayment criteria. 



A revised repayment study with a net $2,235,000 revenue increase in each future year over the current repayment study
demonstrates that all costs are paid within their repayment life. The net additional requirement amounts to a net
6 percent increase in revenues and is primarily due to increased O&M costs at the generating projects. It is proposed
that revised rate schedules applicable to TVA (for the benefit of preference customers served from the TVA System)
and Other Preference Customers of Southeastern contain the following unit rates: 







The referenced January 1994 current repayment study along with a 
revised repayment study dated January 1994 and previous system 
repayment studies are available for examination at the Samuel Elbert Building, Elberton, Georgia 30635. Proposed
Rate Schedules 
CC-1-D, CK-1-C, CM-1-C, CBR-1-C, CSI-1-C, CEK-1-C,
and CTV-1-C are 
also available.




Issued in Elberton, Georgia, January 31, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Parker-Davis Project Notice of Rate Order No. WAPA-55</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Western Area Power Administration, DOE.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Rate Order_Parker-Davis Project (P-DP) Firm Power Rate and Firm and Nonfirm Transmission Service
Rate Adjustments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is given of the confirmation and approval by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) of Rate Order
No. WAPA-55 placing the proposed rate schedules_firm power PD-F4, firm transmission service PD-FT4,
nonfirm transmission service PD-NFT4, and firm transmission service for Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects
(SLCA/IP) PD-FCT4_for the P-DP of the Western Area Power Administration (Western) into effect on an interim
basis. These proposed P-DP rates, hereafter called the provisional P-DP rates, will remain in effect
on an interim basis until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) confirms, approves, and places them into
effect on a final basis for a 5-year period or until superseded.


The Deputy Secretary, DOE, approved the existing P-DP rate schedules PD-F3, PD-FCT3, and PF-NFT3
by Rate Order No. WAPA-48 on an interim basis, effective on October 1, 1990 (55 FR 36887, September 7, 1990). FERC
approved the P-DP rate schedules on a final basis through September 30, 1992, by Order dated November 15, 1990
(53 FERC Par. 62,157).
The Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy on August 19, 1992 by Rate Order No. WAPA-57,
extended these rate schedules for not more than one year (57 FR 39400, August 31, 1992). The Acting Assistant Secretary
for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy on September 29, 1993, by Rate Order No. WAPA-64, further extended
these rate schedules through March 31, 1994 (58 FR 50917; September 29, 1993).
Neither of said WAPA Rate Orders, 57 or 64 were submitted to FERC for its concurrence, inasmuch as these orders were
in the nature of temporary extensions of existing rates, pending the development of long term rates, so that FERC approval
would have been premature. In any event, rates of such nature need not be approved by FERC, as specified in existing
regulations, 10 CFR 902.23(b).
Western is proposing to implement a two-step process for the provisional P-DP rates for firm power and firm and
nonfirm transmission service. Step one of the provisional P-DP rates will become effective February 1, 1994,
and step two of the provisional P-DP rates will become effective October 1, 1995.
Step one of the provisional P-DP rates consists of an energy rate of 5.79 mills per kilowatthour (mills/kWh)
and a capacity rate of $2.54 per kilowatt/month (kW/month) for a composite rate of 11.58 mills/kWh. Step one of the
provisional P-DP rates for transmission service consists of a firm transmission service rate of $10.40 per
kilowatt/year (kW/year), a nonfirm transmission service rate of 1.98 mills/kWh, and a firm transmission service
rate for SLCA/IP of $5.20/kW/season. A season for the firm transmission service rate for SLCA/IP is 6 months.
Step two of the provisional P-DP rates consists of an energy rate of 6.01 mills/kWh and a capacity rate of $2.63/kW/month
for a composite rate of 12.01 mills/kWh. Step two of the provisional P-DP rates for transmission service consists
of a firm transmission service rate of $12.55/kW/year, a nonfirm transmission service rate of 2.39 mills/kWh, and
a firm transmission service rate for SLCA/IP of $6.27/kW/season.
A comparison of existing P-DP rates and the two-step provisional P-DP rates follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 By Amendment No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108, published November 10, 1993 (58 FR 59716), the Secretary
of Energy delegated (1) the authority to develop long-term power and transmission rates on a nonexclusive basis to
the Administrator of Western; (2) the authority to confirm, approve, and place such rates into effect on an interim
basis to the Deputy Secretary; and (3) the authority to confirm, approve, and place into effect on a final basis, to
remand, or to disapprove such rates to FERC. Existing DOE procedures for public participation in power rate adjustments
(10 CFR Part 903) became effective on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37837). 


These power and transmission rates are established pursuant to the DOE Organization Act (42 U.S.C.  7101 

et seq.

); the Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C.  371 

et seq.

) as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments, particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act
of 1939 (43 U.S.C.  485h(c)); section 2 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 1028, 1039); the Parker-Davis
Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 143); Final Rule (10 CFR Part 904) published in the 

Federal Register

 at 51 FR 43154 on November 28, 1986; the DOE financial reporting policies, procedures, and methodology (DOE RA 6120.2
dated September 20, 1979); and the procedures for public participation in rate adjustments for power and transmission
service marketed by Western (10 CFR Part 903) published in the 

Federal Register

 at 50 FR 37837 on September 18, 1985. 
Based upon data available in fiscal year (FY) 1991, the PRS for the P-DP showed that the existing composite rate
of 9.03 mills/kWh for firm power, firm transmission rate of $8.20/kW/year, nonfirm transmission rate of 1.50 mills/kWh,
and a firm transmission service rate for SLCA/IP of $4.10/kW/season would not provide sufficient revenues to pay
the project costs within the prescribed time periods. The Ratesetting PRS indicates substantial rate increases
for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service are required in order to meet revenue requirements for FY
1994 through the end of the study. Because this represents a substantial increase over the existing P-DP rates,
Western is proposing to implement a two-step rate process for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service.

Rate increases are due largely to the increases in replacement and addition activities on P-DP. The original
P-DP investment was fully paid in 1984 and the irrigation investment was fully paid in 1986. 

However, the P-DP is undergoing a major replacement and refurbishment plan needed for environmental compliance,
safety, and reliability. The rate increases can also be attributed to an increase in purchased power expense. The
increase in purchased power expense resulted from flooding conditions along the Colorado River in southwestern
Arizona which created a generation deficiency. 
During the 143-day comment period, Western received 31 written comments. In addition, nine speakers commented during
the September 11, 1992, public comment forum. During the second comment period of 70 days, Western received 19 written
comments. In addition, seven speakers commented during the July 14, 1993, public comment forum. All comments and
responses are addressed in the rate order. 
Rate Order No. WAPA-55, confirming, approving, and placing the P-DP proposed rate adjustments into effect
on an interim basis is issued, and the rate schedules PD-F4, PD-FT4, PD-NFT4, and PD-FCT4 will
be promptly submitted to FERC for confirmation and approval on a final basis.

Public Notice and Comment 



The procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions, 10 CFR Part 903,
have been followed by Western in the development of the P-DP firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission rates.
The provisional P-DP rates for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service represent an increase of
more than 1 percent in total P-DP revenues; therefore, it is a major rate adjustment as defined at 10 CFR   903.2(e)
and 903.2(f)(1). The distinction between a minor and major rate adjustment is used only to determine the public procedures
for the rate adjustment. 

The following summarizes the steps Western took to ensure involvement of interested parties in the rate process:


1. A 

Federal Register

 notice was published on May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19904), officially announcing the proposed P-DP rate adjustments
for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service; initiating the public consultation and comment period;
announcing the June 19, 1992, public information forum and the June 30, 1992, public information and comment forum;
and presenting procedures for public participation. 

2. A letter was mailed to all P-DP customers and other interested parties on May 19, 1992, providing a copy of the
P-DP proposed rate adjustments brochure and announcing the informal customer meeting. The informal customer
meeting was held on June 3, 1992, in Phoenix, Arizona. At this informal meeting, Western representatives explained
the need for the increase and answered questions from those attending. 

3. At the public information forum held on June 19, 1992, Western explained the need for the proposed rate adjustments
and answered questions from those attending. Western also announced a second public comment forum and the extension
of the consultation and comment period for the P-DP. 

4. At the public information forum and public comment forum held on June 30, 1992, Western explained the need for the
proposed P-DP rate adjustments in greater detail and answered questions. 

5. On August 6, 1992, a 

Federal Register

 notice was published (57 FR 34776) formally announcing the extension of the consultation and comment period through
September 28, 1992, for the proposed rate adjustments for the P-DP. 

6. An additional public comment forum was held on September 11, 1992, to give the public an opportunity to comment on
the proposed P-DP rates for the record. Nine people, who represent customers and customer groups, made oral
comments. 

7. Thirty-one written comment letters were received during the 143-day consultation and comment period. The consultation
and comment period ended September 28, 1992. 

8. A letter was mailed to all P-DP customers and other interested parties on June 29, 1993, announcing the reopening
of the consultation and comment period and providing a copy of an addendum to the P-DP proposed rate adjustments
brochure. This letter also announced the public information/public comment forum to be held on July 14, 1993, in Phoenix,
Arizona. 

9. On July 13, 1993, a 

Federal Register

 notice was published (58 FR 37731) formally announcing the reopening of the consultation and comment period on the
proposed P-DP firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service rate adjustments. 

10. At the public information forum held on July 14, 1993, Western representatives explained the need to reopen the
consultation and comment period and answered questions. The consultation and comment period was reopened due to
an unexpected increase in purchased power in FY 1993. 

11. The public comment forum was held on July 14, 1993, to give the public another opportunity to comment on the proposed
P-DP rates for the record. Seven people, who represent customers and customer groups, made oral comments. 

12. Nineteen written comment letters were received during the second consultation and comment period of 70 days.
The second consultation and comment period ended on September 7, 1993.

Project History 


The Parker Dam Power Project was authorized by section 2 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of August 30, 1935 (49 Stat. 1028,
1039), and the Davis Dam Project was authorized April 26, 1941, by the Acting Secretary of the Interior under Provisions
of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C.  485 

et seq.

). The P-DP was formed by the consolidation of the two projects under the terms of the Act of May 28, 1954 (68 Stat.
143). 
Davis Dam, which creates Lake Mohave, provides regulation, both hourly and seasonally, of the water releases from
Lake Mead (through Hoover Dam and Powerplant) to facilitate water delivery for downstream irrigation requirements
and for water delivery beyond the boundary of the United States as required by the Mexican Water Treaty. Operation
of the powerplant began in January 1951 with a generating capacity of 225,000 kW. During the period 1974-78 the
generator nameplate capacity was increased to 240,000 kW by rewinding the generator stators. 
Construction of Parker Dam was authorized for the purposes of controlling floods, improving river navigation, regulating
the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof, for the reclamation
of public lands and Indian reservations and for other beneficial uses, and for the generation of electric energy as
a means of making the P-DP a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking. 
Parker Dam was constructed by Reclamation with funds advanced by MWD. Lake Havasu, the reservoir created behind Parker
Dam, serves as the forebay from which water is diverted into the MWD aqueduct. The aqueduct delivers a major portion
of California's entitlement of Colorado River water to southern California and is the diversion point for delivering
Central Arizona Project water to Arizona. The reservoir operation is limited to minor storage fluctuations. The
dam provides a head of approximately 75 feet for the Parker Powerplant. Reclamation began operation of the Parker
Powerplant in December 1942. Although the total generator nameplate capacity is 120,000 kW, the powerplant capacity
is essentially limited to 104,000 kW because of operating constraints of downstream physical structures, primarily
Headgate Rock Dam. Under contract, MWD is entitled to one-half of the net energy generated by the Parker Powerplant
at any given time. 
All facilities of the P-DP were operated and maintained by Reclamation until the formation of DOE pursuant to
the DOE Act, enacted by Congress on August 4, 1977. Pursuant to section 302 of the DOE Act (42 U.S.C.  7152), responsibility
for the power marketing functions of Reclamation, including the construction, operation, and maintenance of substations,
transmission lines, and attendant facilities, was transferred to Western. The responsibility for operation and
maintenance of the dams and powerplants remains with Reclamation. 


Power Repayment Studies 


PRSs are prepared each FY to determine if power revenues will be sufficient to pay, within the prescribed time periods,
all costs assigned to the power function. Repayment criteria are based on law, policies, and authorizing legislation.
DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, section 12.b, states: 




In addition to the recovery of the above costs (operation and maintenance and interest expenses) on a year-by-year
basis, the expected revenues are at least sufficient to recover (1) each dollar of power investment at Federal hydroelectric
generating plants within 50 years after they become revenue producing, except as otherwise provided by law; plus,
(2) each annual increment of Federal transmission investment within the average service life of such transmission
facilities or within a maximum of 50 years, whichever is less; plus, (3) the cost of each replacement of a unit of property
of a Federal power system within its expected service life up to a maximum of 50 years; plus, (4) each dollar of assisted
irrigation investment within the period established for the irrigation water users to repay their share of construction
costs; plus (5) other costs such as payments to basin funds, participating projects, or States.

Discussion 



Based upon FY 1991 data, the PRS for the P-DP showed that the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh for firm
power, a transmission rate of $8.20/kW/year, a nonfirm transmission service rate of 1.50 mills/kWh, and a firm transmission
service rate for SLCA/IP of $4.10/kW/season would not provide sufficient revenues to pay the project costs within
the prescribed time periods. The Ratesetting PRS indicates that a substantial rate adjustment for firm power and
firm and nonfirm transmission service is required to meet revenue requirements for FY 1994 through the end of the study.
Because the firm transmission service rate adjustments are substantial increases over the existing P-DP rates,
and in response to customer requests and comments, Western is proposing to implement a two-step rate process for firm
power and firm and nonfirm transmission service. 

The provisional P-DP rates filed with FERC have been updated from the rates originally proposed in the customer
brochure and Federal Register

 notice dated May 8, 1992. The changes to the Ratesetting PRS are summarized as follows: 




_Multiproject costs were updated through September 30, 1991. The PAO is heavily involved in the process of total quality
improvement and has a Process Improvement Team (PIT) evaluating the multiproject cost process. This PIT is made up
of representatives from Engineering, Operations, Budget, Finance, and Rates. Recommendations concerning an improved
process are expected to be published and implemented (if approved) early in 1994. To the extent implemented recommendations
make a change in multiproject cost allocations and in rates, changes will be reflected in subsequent rate processing.


_Replacement and addition projections in the cost evaluation period were changed to incorporate ``The Engineering
Ten-Year Construction and Replacement Plan'' dated July 1992 for the cost evaluation period. 

_Extraordinary costs were excluded from out years (FY 1998-2047) resulting in minor reductions in estimates
of O&M costs. 

_Future-year replacements in FY 1998-2047 are projected at the most current interest rate of 7.875 percent
as compared to the FY 1991 interest rate of 8.50 percent. 

_Projections used in FY 1992 for O&M, interest expense, and operating revenues were updated to FY 1992 actuals
as stated in Western's and Reclamation's FY 1992 financial statements. 

_The proposed P-DP rates for firm power and firm and nonfirm transmission service were initially proposed as a single-step
rate increase effective for a 5-year period beginning October 1, 1993. However, in response to customer comments,
Western is proposing to implement a two-step rate process. Step one of the provisional P-DP rates will become
effective February 1, 1994. Step two of the provisional P-DP rates will become effective October 1, 1995. 

_The FY 1993 purchased power expense has been updated.

The existing and provisional annual revenue requirements for the P-DP* are as follows: 






The rate increase is necessary to satisfy the cost-recovery criteria set forth in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. 


Apportionment of Cost Study 


The provisional P-DP rates for firm and nonfirm transmission service were based on the Apportionment of Cost
Study that analyzed the split between annual transmission service and power service costs. The firm transmission
service rate is established to assure that the P-DP customers have an equitable share in payment of costs associated
with the P-DP transmission system. The beneficiaries of the P-DP transmission system include customers
for firm electric service, firm transmission service, and firm transmission service for SLCA/IP power. 
The Apportionment of Cost Study, dated FY 1977, determined an apportionment of 55 percent and 45 percent for power
costs and transmission costs respectively. The latest Apportionment of Cost Study, dated FY 1992, determined separate
apportionments for step one of the provisional P-DP rates and step two of the provisional P-DP rates. The
apportionments for step one of the provisional P-DP rates are 34.11 percent for power costs and 65.89 percent
for transmission service costs. The apportionments for step two of the provisional P-DP rates are 25.82 percent
for power costs and 74.18 percent for transmission service costs. 
Since the 1977 Apportionment of Cost Study was completed, P-DP's initial power investment has been repaid and
the transmission system has deteriorated, requiring more replacement and refurbishment activities. These factors
are causing a shift from power to transmission service related costs in the Apportionment of Cost Study. The provisional
P-DP rates for firm transmission service will earn an additional annual amount of $5,670,495 from 1994-95
and $9,857,542 from 1996-2047. 
The current Apportionment of Cost Study derives the percentage of required revenues to be recovered from firm power
customers and firm transmission customers. The study is performed separately for each step of the P-DP provisional
rates. Western has adopted a three-step process that evaluates capital expenditures, annual operating expenses
and other revenue, and customer use of the P-DP transmission system. The first step of the study assigns project
investments to either the power system or the transmission system. This step is used in the second step of the Apportionment
of Cost Study. 
The second step entails apportioning annual operating costs and other revenues to either the power system or the transmission
system. Annual operating costs and other revenues were determined by taking an annual average of future years in the
cost evaluation period. Annual costs include O&M, multiproject, CSRS, interest, and principal payments. Other
revenues include rent and miscellaneous, fuel replacement, multiproject, project use, and nonfirm transmission
service. If an annual operating cost or a component of other revenue was determined to benefit both the power and transmission
system, the apportionment was assigned in accordance with the apportionment of investment costs derived in the first
step. 
The transmission system is used to deliver power committed under electric service contracts. Therefore, a portion
of the transmission system cost should be recovered by power sales revenues. The third step of the Apportionment of
Cost Study determines the share of transmission costs to be recovered by power sale revenues. Annual costs are assigned
to transmission or power production on the basis of power system use by each customer. The assignment by use is based
upon contract capacity commitments for the P-DP transmission system. Users of the P-DP transmission
system include customers for (1) P-DP wholesale firm energy, (2) P-DP firm transmission service, (3)
SLCA/IP firm transmission service, and (4) project use. Commitments under transmission service agreements are
assigned to transmission, while commitments under electric service contracts and project use are assigned to power
production. The tables below show the development of revenue requirements from power sales and transmission service
agreements and the assignment of cost into their related revenue categories.

Alternative Transmission Rates 


As stated in the Federal Register

 notice published on May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19904), Western proposed alternative P-DP rates for both firm and nonfirm
transmission service. The proposed alternative rates would have set a single rate for the use of either or both the
P-DP and the AC Intertie transmission systems. However, based on customers' requests, Western decided not
to propose the alternative transmission service rates at this time. 


Replacement and Addition Activities 


The provisional P-DP rate adjustments are due largely to an increase in replacements and additions on P-DP.
P-DP is undergoing a major replacement and refurbishment plan needed for environmental compliance, safety,
and reliability. Western initially used data from the FY 1993 construction budget for replacement and addition activities
during the CEP (1994-98). However, during the consultation and comment period, Western decided to reevaluate
the replacement and addition activities because of the economic strain being placed on the P-DP customers and
because of the unrealistic expectations that all replacement and addition activities would be completed during
the CEP. Western compared the data from the FY 1993 construction budget documents with the most current construction
data as stated in ``The Engineering Ten-Year Construction and Replacement Plan'' dated July 1992. The Engineering
Ten-Year Plan showed the most current construction data Western had on replacement and addition activities over
the next 10 years. Western made the decision to revise the Ratesetting PRS by incorporating the most current data from
the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. All of the replacements and additions in the Ratesetting PRS are authorized power
system facilities for which Congress has appropriated funds for FY 1993 construction, and which will be in service
within the CEP. Thus, the Ratesetting PRS only incorporates the first 5 years of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. These
revisions, based on data from the Engineering Ten-Year Plan, will help maintain the lowest rate possible without
jeopardizing the crucial need of a safe and reliable P-DP transmission system. A comparison of the initial ratesetting
PRS using the FY 1993 construction budget to the Ratesetting PRS using the Engineering Ten-Year Plan follows:

<TEXT>
 





There are other replacement and addition activities in Western's O&M budget documents which are not included
in the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. These items are mostly communication equipment, including microwave equipment
and remote terminal units. Each of these O&M budget activities was compared to the most recent data and revised
to reflect an overall reduction of $1.5 million in FY 1997. Western will continue to evaluate the implementation of
the Engineering Ten-Year Plan and adequacy of the provisional P-DP rates and will include any changes in future rate
adjustments. 

The capitalized costs for future replacements and additions in the cost evaluation period include IDC. The IDC calculation
for each replacement is determined by the interest rate in the year construction begins. The annual interest expense
for replacements and additions is also based on the interest rate in the year construction begins. The cumulative
investment cost for replacements through the cost evaluation period is $115,859,859. The cumulative investment
cost for additions through the cost evaluation period is $126,839,043. 
The replacement program is used to forecast replacements in years 1999-2047. The replacement program showed
low replacement levels in some FYs and high levels in other years. Western believes that only a certain amount of work
can be done in any given year. Therefore, Western decided to average the replacement numbers to reflect a stable level
of replacements which could be supported over the long term. 


Purchased Power Expense 


The consultation and comment period was reopened due to the increase in purchased power expense for FY 1993. Data for
purchased power were initially based on the FY 1993 congressionally approved budget. However, during FY 1993, current
actual expenses for purchased power far exceed the original FY 1993 congressional budget estimate of $700,000. The
current expenses for purchased power for FY 1993 are $5,000,000. This change in purchased power expense has led to
an increase in the firm power rate. The increase in purchased power expense resulted from flooding conditions along
the Colorado River in southwestern Arizona, which created a generation deficiency. 


Statement of Revenue and Related Expenses 


The following table provides a summary of revenue and expense data for the 5-year provisional rate approval period.

Basis for Rate Development_P-DP 



Firm Power Rate 



The provisional firm power P-DP rate was designed to reflect the power/transmission split as derived in the
Apportionment of Cost Study and continues to maintain a 50/50 split between revenue from energy and capacity rates
based on a 60-percent load factor. 

Step one of the provisional P-DP rates consists of a 5.79 mills/kWh energy rate and $2.54/kW/month capacity
rate effective February 1, 1994. The necessary composite rate is 11.58 mills/kWh, which is an increase of 28 percent
over the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh. 

Step two of the provisional P-DP rates consists of a 6.01 mills/kWh energy rate and $2.63/kW/month capacity
rate effective October 1, 1995. The necessary composite rate is 12.01 mills/kWh, which is an increase of 33 percent
over the existing composite rate of 9.03 mills/kWh. 



Transmission Service Rates 



The provisional firm transmission service P-DP rate was designed to reflect the power/transmission split
as derived in the Apportionment of Cost Study. Step one of the provisional P-DP rates for firm transmission service
is $10.40/kW/year ($.87/kW/month) and nonfirm transmission service is 1.98 mills/kWh. The step-one rate for firm
transmission service for SLCA/IP is $5.20/kW/season ($.87/kW/month). A season for the firm transmission service
rate for SLCA/IP is 6 months. 

Step two of the provisional P-DP rates for firm transmission service is $12.55/kW/year ($1.05/kW/month) and
nonfirm transmission service is 2.39 mills/kWh. The step two rate for firm transmission service for SLCA/IP is $6.27/kW/season
($1.05/kW/month).

Parker-Davis Comments 


Operation and Maintenance Costs 




Comment:

 Western's ``General Western Allocation'' expenses are too high and they are unfairly charged to P-DP. Western
should explain the justification of the allocating of costs from its Washington, D.C., and Golden, Colorado, offices.



Response:

 Western's indirect costs are divided into three categories: Associated direct expense (ADE), administrative and
general expense (AGE), and general Western allocation (GWA). ADE consists of undistributed costs and expenses for
all types of direct costs which possess a clear relationship to benefiting activities and are recovered in the power
rate base. AGE costs are general and administrative expenses benefiting ratepayers and represent primarily costs
for nonmanagerial staff and support. GWA is a subset of AGE and includes ADP expenses, general office supplies, contracted
administrative services, etc. Independent auditors have determined that AGE and GWA exclusively benefit ratepayers
and should be recovered as part of the costs included in the power rate base. The indirect cost distribution system
was designed and endorsed by a major accounting firm and is consistent with industry standards. Western does not believe
these costs are excessive in the manner in which they are distributed. 


Comment:

 In light of the extensive replacement and addition program being carried out by Western, O&M costs are not projected
to decline in the future as supposedly older, high maintenance equipment is replaced with newer, lower maintenance
equipment. 


Comment:

 Western feels it is necessary to overestimate operation and maintenance expenses as some sort of safeguard in the
budget and planning process. This is most recently seen by comparison of budget to actual numbers for FY 92. We believe
a sharper pencil should be taken to those O&M projections in the process. 


Response:

 O&M costs are projected in the future in accordance with DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. It is Western's policy, as in section
10, paragraph 2(f) of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, to estimate O&M costs based on historical cost trends and actual
project costs from the past. During the cost evaluation period, O&M expense is based on the FY 1993 budget, and
projections for FY 1999 through FY 2047 are held constant based on the last year in the cost evaluation period less extraordinary
maintenance. O&M does decline in the cost evaluation period. Western has a cost containment committee which
reviews and evaluates the O&M budget. The committee's goals are to achieve the lowest O&M budget possible
for Western. Therefore, Western does not believe that projections for the operation and maintenance budgets are
overstated. 


Comment:

 Rate impact analysis was not performed prior to seeking congressional authorization for budgeted O&M expenditures.



Comment:

 Western and Reclamation have not attempted to limit O&M expense.

Response:

 Although specific rate impact analyses were not performed, Western and Reclamation have placed a priority on cost
containment. The formation of Western's Cost Containment Committee takes into consideration all impacts to the
rates. Cost containment plays a major role in the preparation of Western's and Reclamation's O&M budgets. Western
has invited the customers into the planning process, which will evaluate programs and rate impacts. 


Comment:

 Power Accounting and Collection, Conservation and Renewable Energy, and Power Marketing and General Resource Planning
has increased 39.6 percent from FY 1991 and FY 1992. Total O&M increased 38.0 percent from FY 1991 to FY 1992. The
magnitude of projected expenditures for O&M on an average annual basis exceeded the rate of inflation by 4.1 percent
per year. 


Comment:

 P-DP O&M expenses have run counter to the regional and local trends and forecasts for electric utilities.
The cost projections for replacements and additions for the 5-year rate evaluation programs and the study period
appear to be singular in the industry from the standpoint of magnitude. Since the late 1980's, the trend in the Pacific
and Rocky Mountain Southwest has been to keep O&M expenses and replacement cost increases below the rate of inflation.



Response:

 Western has revised the PRS to reflect actual expenditures in FY 1992. Power Accounting and Collection, Conservation
and Renewable Energy, and Power Marketing and General Resource Planning have increased 5.00 percent from FY 1991
to FY 1992. One contributing factor to the increased O&M is that the consolidation of the Boulder City Area Office
and the Phoenix District Office was made during FY 1991, having an effect on staffing levels and work being performed.
Specific division (e.g., power marketing) activities were put off until the division could acquire staff. The average
increase of O&M cost per year over the cost evaluation period is 1.46 percent, which is below the rate of inflation.



Comment:

 Western has failed to explain why administrative and general costs increased dramatically following the move of
its regional office to Phoenix and the consolidation of its other offices, particularly since WAPA claimed that these
changes would reduce costs by $1.5 million annually. 


Response:

 Western's administrative and general costs have not dramatically increased since moving the regional office to
Phoenix and consolidating other offices. According to Western's FY 1992 financial statement, the general Western
allocation portion for the Phoenix Area has actually decreased from $2.6 million in FY 1991 to $2.2 million in FY 1992,
which represents a decrease of 15 percent. The Phoenix Area's AGE also decreased from $1.5 million in FY 1991 to $1.3
million in FY 1992, which represents a decrease of 13 percent. Western had estimated an overall savings of $1.5 million
annually. However, the consolidation was not completed until FY 1992. Western believes the full recognition of savings
from the consolidation has not yet become evident. 


Alternative Transmission Rates 




Comment:

 Customers renew their support for the alternative transmission rates. 


Comment:

 Customers do not support the alternative transmission rates because of subsidizing and project repayment issues.
Each transmission project should be planned, designed, and operated on its own merit. 


Response:

 Since Western and the customers agreed not to recommend implementation of the alternative transmission service
rates, Western plans to implement separate P-DP and AC Intertie rates for firm transmission service and nonfirm
transmission service. 


Comment:

 Western should conduct further studies to determine the feasibility of complete operational integration of the
various transmission facilities in the Phoenix Area. 


Response:

 Operationally, PAO's power systems are integrated. Power marketing functions will continue to be performed separately
for each individual project. Western will continue to work with the customers in conducting studies and evaluating
other alternatives for developing a single transmission rate for the various projects within the PAO. 


Apportionment of Cost Study 




Comment:

 The cost allocation review of historic Western O&M expenses shows no dollars being charged against the power
function on an actual basis, which is inconsistent with the facts.

Comment: 

The use of historical costs are not relevant to the Apportionment of Cost Study because the historical costs do not
affect the proposed rates. 


Response: 

Western has revised the Apportionment of Cost Study to reflect customer comments. The revised study does not include
historical Western O&M expenses because the historical costs do not affect the provisional P-DP rates.



Comment: 

Western should adopt a reasonable or fair allocation by splitting the difference between the historic 45/55-percent
split and the proposed 77/23-percent split or retain its historic allocation until a detailed study can be conducted
regarding what amount of actual Western O&M should be assigned to power. 


Response: 

Western believes the revised Apportionment of Cost Study is an equitable and detailed study that apportions the costs
between power production and transmission service. The 45/55-percent split was based on a study presented in the
June 1979 rate adjustment brochure for P-DP. Since that time, there has been a shift from power costs to transmission
costs, which is due to the initial investment and irrigation investment being repaid in 1986. Thus, the majority of
the investment to be repaid is related to the refurbishment of the transmission system. Western's future intent is
to evaluate the apportionment between power and transmission costs annually and to make revisions to the rate design
when rate adjustments occur. 


Comment: 

Western's allocation methodology between generation and transmission does not follow the accepted practice in
expensing capital costs and allocating other income. Western should propose a change by allocating annual principal
and interest based on generation and transmission plant original cost depreciated. 


Response: 

The Apportionment of Cost Study has been revised to expense capital costs and allocate other income based on total
generation and transmission investment. However, Western also considered the unpaid Federal investment with regard
to annual principal and interest costs. Western has determined that the unpaid Federal investment is a transmission
related cost. Therefore, annual principal payments and interest costs for the unpaid investment will be allocated
to transmission. 


Comment: 

The functions of power scheduling and power marketing are power related. Furthermore, some percentage of FTEs should
have been charged against the power function. 


Response: 

Western has revised the Apportionment of Cost Study that is incorporated into the PRS to allocate a percentage of power
scheduling, FTEs, and power marketing to power related costs. The percentage used for allocating these costs is based
on the percentage of total power investment to the total investment. 


Comment: 

Western did not allocate the power and transmission related costs to customer classes.

Response:

 Western allocated the power and transmission related costs to customer classes based on power system use by each type
of customer. Users of the P-DP transmission system include customers for (1) P-DP wholesale firm energy,
(2) P-DP firm transmission service, (3) firm transmission service for SLCA/IP, and (4) project use. Commitments
under transmission service contracts are assigned to transmission while commitments under electric service contracts
and project use are assigned to power production. Western believes this is an equitable way of allocating power and
transmission costs among the customers. 



Comment:

 The Allowance for Interest in Western's Apportionment of Cost Study does not conform to Western's PRS. We understand
that Western is aware of this discrepancy, and we recommend that the proper correction be made. 



Response:

 Western has corrected the Allowance for Interest in the Apportionment of Cost Study so that it conforms to the PRS.




Comment:

 Irrigation investment in the amount of $26.8 million has been assigned by Western to transmission, but should be assigned
to power. The irrigation investment represents an assignment of certain hydraulic plants to irrigation and has no
relationship to transmission. 



Response:

 The Apportionment of Cost Study uses Western's and Reclamation's FY 1992 financial statements, budget documents,
and the Engineering Ten-Year Plan to determine the investments that are allocated to power and the investments that
are allocated to transmission. Investments stated in Western's financial statement and Engineering Ten-Year Plan
are considered transmission investments, and investments stated in Reclamation's financial statement and FY 1993
budget are considered power investments. Irrigation investment is in Reclamation's financial statement. Therefore,
the irrigation investment in the amount of $26.8 million is already assigned to power in the Apportionment of Cost
Study. 



Comment:

 An investment in FY 1990 of $3.4 million in account 331 (Hydraulic Production_Structures and Improvements) was assigned
by Western to transmission, but should be assigned to power. 



Response:

 The investment in FY 1990 of $3.4 million in account 331 (Hydraulic Production_Structures and Improvements) is shown
in the P-DP replacement study. The P-DP replacement study incorporates both Western's and Reclamation's
investments as stated in each of the agencies' financial statements. Western has made the assumption that investments
appearing in Reclamation's financial statements would be allocated to power and investments appearing in Western's
financial statements would be allocated to transmission. The replacement study was not used as a source document
for the Apportionment of Cost Study. 



Comment:

 Existing and future investments in communication facilities have been assigned entirely to transmission. A more
proper assignment would be 50 percent to transmission and 50 percent to power as is done by Western for the CRSP. 



Response:

 Western has researched the possibility of assigning communication equipment equally between power and transmission.
Communication equipment includes supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), microwave system, and the
joint use system. In the Phoenix area, Reclamation and Western separately budget for microwave systems and joint
use systems. Western has determined that SCADA is a unique investment because it has major benefits to both power and
transmission customers and it is being funded through Western's FY 1993 congressional budget. The SCADA system is,
among other uses, used to regulate power flows on the transmission lines. Because SCADA benefits both power and transmission
customers, Western has decided that 50 percent of the costs should be apportioned to power and 50 percent of the costs
consistency should be apportioned to transmission. Therefore, the Apportionment of Cost Study has been changed
to reflect the 50/50 split of the SCADA investment and associated interest expense. 



Comment:

 Western's new PAO has been assigned entirely to transmission. As this office is involved in both power marketing and
transmission, the cost of these facilities should be borne by both power and transmission. 



Response:

 This comment is incorrect in that the costs associated with the new PAO facility have been allocated to both power and
transmission, with power being allocated approximately 16 percent of the costs of said facility. While this may not
readily be apparent at first glance, analysis of the Apportionment of Cost Study will verify this allocation. 

In the Apportionment of Cost Study, Western first determines whether the expenditure was funded by Western or Reclamation.
All expenditures funded by Reclamation are allocated to power. Expenditures by Western are further analyzed to determine
if they benefit only the transmission customers or if they also benefit the power customers (from a powerplant or power
generation standpoint). To the extent the facilities have a direct benefit to the power customers from a power generation
standpoint, a portion of the costs are allocated to power. Western's SCADA system is an example of one of these facilities
in that although the expenditure is funded totally by Western, both the power customers and transmission customers
receive benefits from the system.

Once Western has determined the costs of those facilities which benefit the transmission customers, a further allocation
of costs is conducted. This is due to the fact that the transmission system is utilized both by (1) the power customers
to transmit their power entitlement from the powerplants to their loads and (2) by customers who utilize the transmission
system for bulk power transfers. It is this allocation of costs which properly further allocates costs to power and
transmission and ensures that within the rates charged to the power customers is a component for the use of the transmission
system. This is why the power customers are not charged a transmission charge for their power entitlement. It is this
final allocation which ensures that the power customers are always responsible for a portion of Western costs which
are transmission related. As shown in the Apportionment of Cost Study, the power users are allocated approximately
16 percent of the costs of the new PAO facility. 


Comment:

 Western assigns project use revenues as an expense offset to power costs. Inasmuch as the delivery of this power requires
use of the P-DP transmission system, it is appropriate to assign these revenues (expense offsets) to power and
transmission in proportion to the plant investments in each category (for step-one rates, the allocation would be
31.66 percent to power and 68.34 percent to transmission). 


Comment:

 Customer believes the current allocation of both project use revenues and project use sales is correct in Western's
apportionment study. Classification of sales (kilowatts) as power is acceptable, provided the firm power customer
classification is directly credited with the revenues from the project use sales (kilowatts) as is currently done
in Western's Apportionment of Cost Study. 


Response: 

Western believes the current allocation of project use revenues is correct in the Apportionment of Cost Study. Project
use should be allocated to power because sales are also classified as power. Further, the costs associated with project
use are contained in Reclamation's financial statement and budget documents which are also assigned to power. Project
use costs and benefits have been consistently used in the Apportionment of Cost Study so that the benefits will offset
the costs associated with project use. 


Comment: 

Based on restrictions on the power customers' use of capacity paid for in the power rate and significantly better benefits
to all other users of the transmission system, we do not feel that the allocation of costs according to customer class
is correct. 


Response: 

Western understands the power customers' concerns that the Apportionment of Cost Study treats 
1 kW of P-DP power transmitted over the transmission system the same as 
1 kW of non-P-DP power transmitted over the transmission system, even though the P-DP power is limited
to approximately 56 percent capacity factor. However, Western believes that because the customers have complete
flexibility to schedule their power and energy when they want, Western transmission must be available to handle the
desired transaction. Western bases the Apportionment of Cost Study on the kW of ``reservation'' the customers have
for use of the system and not on the actual kWh usage of the system. From this perspective, power customers and transmission
customers alike pay to have the transmission system reserved for their use, regardless of the actual system use. 


Comment: 

Western should consider a phase-in of what would be a significant shift in allocation of costs from transmission to
generation if the cost apportionment study is adapted. 


Response: 

In response to the customer comments, Western has decided to implement stepped rates for the provisional P-DP
rate schedules. The first steps of the provisional rates are effective from FY 1994-95 and the second steps are
effective for FY 1996-98. Step-one rates reflect only the replacements and additions proposed by Western for
FY 1994-95. Step two rates reflect the replacements and additions for FY 1996 through the end of the study period.
Implementing stepped rates will lessen the impact on the customers by allowing them to phase-in the new rates.

Calculation of Interest During Construction 




Comment:

 Western should reexamine the procedure for utilizing the interest rates in effect at the inception of the project
and change the regulation accordingly. Western's definition of start of construction and charging of IDC should
be revised to reflect FERC policy. 


Comment:

 Western is using the wrong interest rates on replacements and additions. The interest rate in effect for each year
of a project's appropriation should be used and a weighted average rate established on completion of the project.



Response:

 Western's policy is to utilize the interest rate in effect at the inception of the project and Western believes this
accurately reflects FERC policy and is in accordance with DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. IDC accumulates at the appropriate
effective interest rate for a replacement or addition when the first direct cost (FERC Accounts 350 and above) is incurred
to initiate construction or replacement. This interest rate remains constant with the investment. IDC terminates
at the end of the FY in which the facility is placed in service. DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 states that the interest rate to
be used for computing interest during construction shall be the yield rate during the FY in which construction is initiated.
Therefore, Western does not believe that a weighted average reflects FERC policy or is in accordance with DOE Order
No. RA 6120.2. 


Comment:

 Western is using the wrong interest rates on replacements and additions. 


Response:

 Western uses the most current yield interest rates as defined by the Department of the Treasury for each FY. This is
in accordance with the formula set forth in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, paragraph 11(b). 


Comment:

 It was suggested that Western use the most current interest rate. 


Response:

 At the time of the comment forum, Western was using the most current interest rate of 8.5 percent as defined by the Department
of the Treasury. Since then, Western has revised the Ratesetting PRS to reflect the interest rate calculated for FY
1992, which is 7.875 percent. As a result, interest expense in future years has decreased. 


Rate Design 




Comment:

 In its revised PRS of June 1993, Western has continued to use the wheeled kW from early 1992 in the design of its currently
proposed transmission rate. However, there have been increases to Western's transmission capacity under contract,
and further increases are currently known. 


Response:

 Western will use the most current contractual amount of firm transmission in kW for the design of the firm transmission
rate. Therefore, the number of kW will increase from 1,411,228 to 1,508,676 in step one of the P-DP transmission rate.
The number of kW will increase to 1,584,150 in step two of the P-DP transmission rate. 


Comment:

 It is improper to burden the existing transmission customers with the cost of new capacity, and an allowance for increased
contracted kW would remedy somewhat this inappropriate burden. 


Response:

 The only additional transmission facility being added to the system is the Mead-Basic 

#

2 line. Further studies need to be completed to determine what, if any, additional transmission capability is available
to the system as a result of the installation of this transmission line. In the event Western adds additional transmission
capability to the system and contracts for the additional capacity, this would be reflected in the Apportionment
of Cost Study for future PRSs. 


Comment:

 Western should implement multistep rates, designed to meet annual financial obligations without prepayment of
debt. A multistep rate would be designed to meet annual financial obligations. 


Response:

 FERC approves rates for a 5-year period. These rates have to produce adequate revenues that will recover all annual
costs and will repay project investments in no longer than a 50-year period. Rates cannot be approved by FERC beyond
the 5-year window. If multistep rates were designed outside the 5-year window, then the rates within the 5-year window
would not adequately recover all costs and repay project investment over a 50-year period. Thus, the requirements
of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 would not be met. However, within the 5-year period, Western has decided to implement a two-step
rate process, so the customers can phase-in the significant rate increase.

Comment:

 The rate design method does not reflect or adjust to changes in the cost of service for each customer classification
which will occur over time. Western is only applying the results of the Apportionment of Cost Study to the incremental
revenue requirement above that which can be met by the current rates. The net result is dilution of the transmission
contractor's financial obligation at the expense of the power customers.



Comment:

 Western compounds its errors by allocating only the incremental part of the rate increase to power and transmission.
The rate design should be based upon total revenue requirements, not incremental revenue requirements.



Response:

 Western understands the negative aspects of only allocating the incremental part of the rate increase between power
and transmission. However, the customer is assuming that the past apportionment of 55 percent for power and 45 percent
for transmission was incorrect. Western believes the last apportionment between power and transmission is correct,
meaning that the rate design should be incremental. Each year, Western will perform an Apportionment of Cost Study
to stay abreast of the incremental change from year to year. The reason for the large incremental change from power
to transmission is that the original project has been fully repaid and the transmission system is deteriorating and
must be refurbished.



Replacements and Addition Activities





Comment:

 Errors may exist in the assignment of replacement and addition costs between P-DP customers and Federal agencies.
Western did not examine other sources of funding.



Comment:

 The proposed increase is excessive since it includes extensive refurbishment in the Phoenix Area which does not support
the path over which service is provided.



Response:

 The need for projected replacements and additions has been previously examined and justified through the O&M
and engineering budget process. Projected replacements and additions have been identified in Western's Engineering
Ten-Year Plan, along with Western's FY 1993 Budget documents. Further, facility development reports have been developed
which analyze the costs and benefits to Western. Although Western receives some funding through trust and reimbursables
the majority of the costs that benefit the system as a whole are placed into the rate base. Western has included the customers
in the planning process. This will allow the customers to help Western examine sources of funding and plan extensive
refurbishment in the Phoenix Area.



Comment:

 When did the replacement and addition program begin and what is the current status of the program?



Response:

 During FY 1991, Western developed the Engineering Ten-Year Plan which was a planning tool for ongoing replacement
and addition activities. In June 1993, Western invited the customers to participate in developing the engineering
10-year planning process. Western is currently working with the customers in updating and revising the Engineering
Ten-Year Plan. It is Western's intention to update and evaluate the Engineering Ten-Year Plan annually with the customers.



Comment:

 Western has based its decisions to replace facilities and equipment on the age of the facility and equipment or on Western's
desire to try out new equipment technologies. The replacement and addition program was not planned, designed, scheduled,
or maintained to best serve the customers. There is concern on how well Western has managed its program.



Comment:

 Western has not designed facilities in a cost-effective manner.



Comment:

 Concerning its replacement and addition program (program), Western did not (i) perform appropriate planning analysis,
(ii) assess program impact on rates prior to implementation, (iii) inform customers of program, (iv) seek input from
customers, or (v) minimize magnitude of program. Western has not attempted to schedule or prioritize work to minimize
rate impact.



Response:

 Western utilizes accepted utility design standards and detailed engineering economic studies in determining,
planning, and executing construction and replacement projects. These standards and studies are described in Western's
FDRs for each major construction project. Furthermore, the purpose of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan is to effectively
design, plan, prioritize, schedule, and analyze rate impacts on all the Phoenix Area Projects. Western believes
that future rate impacts are minimized and costs can be controlled through this process. Western is now including
the customers in the planning process so they are informed and may provide input on future construction activities.
By including the customers in this process, Western will minimize rate impacts and meet customers' needs.



Comment:

 A fixed amount for replacements of $4.3 million in future FY 1998-2047 cannot be representative of future replacements
when practically the entire system will have been replaced by 1998.



Comment:

 Western should make a commitment to limit replacements to $4.3 million or less after 1997 unless authorized by the
working committee.



Response:

 Western believes the $4.3 million average is a good representation of the future replacement costs and is based on
the replacement program which reflects historic experience and service lives of project equipment and facilities.
Western cannot commit to a fixed amount when the amounts are based on actual experience and an annual budget document,
which change over time.



Comment:

 Western optimistically forecast savings and did not consider the full and true cost of its 5-Year Plan, phase
two of the Phoenix Office, plus the total replacement and addition investment levels, to determine the overall impact
on P-DP rates.



Response:

 Western believes that the benefits of consolidation are just beginning to be recognized and once the consolidation
process is completed, there will be additional long-term savings. Prior to the decision to consolidate the Phoenix
District Office with the Boulder City Area Office, Western conducted a cost/benefit analysis that included replacement
and addition investments. This study analyzed the costs and benefits of five different options of which the option
to consolidate the Phoenix District Office and the Boulder City Area Office indicated the highest cost savings. This
option also indicated the lowest rate impacts. The study concluded (among other things) that planned construction
at Phoenix can be modified and expanded at a reasonable cost to accommodate the Area functions and increase office
space. However, it also indicated that there would be disruption of continuity for up to 2 years and that there would
be additional construction costs.



Comment:

 Western's replacement and additions program is not justifiable.



Comment:

 Western is attempting to replace a large portion of the facilities over a 10-year period. The replacement costs and
the administration and general costs of administering the replacement work peaked, making the rate impact abnormally
high. It is suggested that Western attempt to select a replacement period of 15 to 20 years as compared to the Engineering
Ten-Year Plan.



Comment:

 Western has not explained or justified the astronomical increase in replacements from less than $2 million on average
for the past 10 years to amounts averaging over $14 million for the years 1993 through 1998.

Comment: 

The rate proposal offers considerable discretion in the replacement budget area. This includes the time period over
which the expenditure needs to be made and the necessity of certain expenditures. 



Response: 

The justification for the replacement and addition program is that the P-DP is over 50 years old and is in the process
of a major refurbishment and replacement program. A large portion of the system is deteriorating to the point where
safe and continued operation to all customers is jeopardized. The Engineering Ten-Year Plan analyzes the activities
with considerable scrutiny over a period of 10 years and will be updated annually. While developing the Engineering
Ten-Year Plan, Western deferred certain replacement and addition activities until a later date. Overall, the Engineering
Ten-Year Plan resulted in a refurbishment and replacement program that will improve reliability, improve personnel
safety, increase capacity, and replace out-of-date equipment that cannot be repaired. 



Comment: 

The replacement expenditures after the 5-year evaluation period do not reflect the replacements scheduled during
the evaluation period. As a result, the PRS may include costs for replacements during the study period which will actually
be replaced during the evaluation period. 



Response: 

The replacement study projects replacements after the 5-year evaluation period based on the total plant investment
as of FY 1991. Projections during the cost evaluation period (FY 1994-98) are based on the replacements indicated
in the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. Replacements projected during the cost evaluation period will not be duplicated
in out years, as long as the replacement is made relatively close to the end of the equipment's service life. The replacement
study is based on historic experience and service lives of each type of equipment and has proved to be an effective tool
for projections. 



Comment: 

It appears to the customer that Western is, in effect, double covering future replacement costs by including the $4.3
million annual replacements estimate, notwithstanding the Engineering Ten-Year Plan, which includes a full planning
horizon 5 years beyond the 5-year ratesetting period. The $4.3 million annual replacements projection should be
eliminated from this rate before filing with FERC, in reliance upon the Engineering Ten-Year Plan process and as evidence
of Western's full-faith commitment with its customers to the Engineering Ten-Year Plan concept. 



Comment: 

Western has the perfect opportunity here to submit this rate to FERC without the $4.3 million estimate on replacements
in the future with the Engineering Ten-Year Plan as the appropriate rationale for any deviation from DOE Order No.
RA 6120.2 that FERC might consider it to be. 



Comment: 

While it is the general intent of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 that Western include allowances for replacements for the entire
study period of the PRS, DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 also permits a deviation from this requirement in paragraph 1. It is
recommended that Western adopt any reasonable approach to mitigate this large increase. FERC addressed the matter
of replacements in Docket EF89-5041-000. While we may not necessarily agree with the FERC order in its
entirety, we believe that Western has the ability to deviate from the requirements of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. Therefore,
Western should omit from its proposed PRS the currently proposed allowances for replacements in the amount of $217
million ($4.3 million per year) for years 1998-2047. The use of an average amount has helped minimize the rate
impact. 



Response: 

In the recent past, FERC has ruled on a P-DP rate adjustment that the PRS should show that revenue produced by the
provisional P-DP rates is adequate to pay all of the project's annual costs, repay investment with interest
of the project, and provide for payment of replacement costs over the life of the project. Docket No. EF 89-5041-000
states:




Nevertheless, WAPA has failed to recognize replacement costs that will be incurred between 1993 and 2042. The draft
PRS that WAPA provided in response to staff's request provides an indication of the extent of these replacements and
their considerable costs. 

WAPA has neither complied with Order No. RA 6120.2 nor asserted any basis upon which the Commission could find WAPA's
interim rates ``consistent with sound business principles'' or ``sufficient to recover the costs of producing and
transmitting electric energy . . . .'' Under these circumstances, the Commission will exercise its delegated authority
to remand the interim Parker-Davis rates and to direct WAPA either to: 1) file substitute rates and accompanying documents
in accordance with the terms of this order; or 2) alternatively, refile its proposed rates and clearly demonstrate
that the omission of the replacement costs discussed herein from the proposed rates and the PRS has been ``specifically
approved by the Secretary of Energy, authorized by statute, or identified and explained in a transmittal memorandum
or in a footnote to the reports.''

 


Therefore, Western cannot omit the allowances for replacements in the amount of $217 million ($4.3 million per year)
for years 1998-2047. The use of an average amount has substantially mitigated much of the impact on rates.

Western is working with the customers on a review of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan of capital additions and replacements
and of the appropriateness of its incorporation into the PRS. Specifically, the customers and Western will examine
the use in the PRS of projections of future replacements from the Engineering Ten-Year Plan versus projections of
replacements from the Replacement Study portion of the PRS. Western and its customers will examine which future replacements
projection and revenue requirements are most appropriate for reliable operation of the Federal system and setting
rates. 




Comment:

 Customer is concerned about the high concentration of replacement and addition costs in FY 1994 and FY 1995 within
the rate period. History dictates that Western will, in fact, not be able to manage or execute those levels of expenditures
in short periods of time. Please reexamine the expenditures schedule before the rate is finalized to avoid any unnecessary
pinch-point resulting from unrealistic projections. 



Response:

 Western has reexamined the replacement costs and believes the costs used in the PRS for replacements in FY 1994 and
FY 1995 are appropriate and are the best estimates to date. Western hopes to work through the engineering 10-year planning
process with the customers to reexamine the expenditures schedule. This will not be completed before the rate process
is completed. However, Western has examined the pinch-point in the PRS. The step-one rate increase is being set to
meet annual expenses and interest expense. The step-two rate increase is being set to meet required payments needed
to fully repay investment. 



Purchased Power 





Comment:

 Purchased power costs do not reflect planned flow releases from upstream reservoirs (i.e., $700,000 in purchased
power costs should be eliminated after FY 1993). On April 8, 1992, Reclamation prepared a forecast of water releases
through Hoover Dam. This forecast is based upon a consumptive water use downstream of Hoover Dam of 7.5 MAF and a delivery
requirement of 1.5 MAF to Mexico. From 1993-97, these figures match the flows in 1987, and in 1987, P-DP
did not purchase power. P-DP generated 482,875,918 kWh in excess of contract requirements. 




Response:

 Western has certain contractual capacity and energy commitments to the P-DP contractors, regardless of the
forecasted water releases from Hoover Dam, the upstream water supplier to Parker and Davis Dams. Western calculates
the purchased power costs based upon a comparison of Reclamation's schedule of downstream water releases with the
projected energy schedules of the P-DP contractors. While the total water releases, on an annual basis, may
be sufficient to generate all of the energy requirements of the P-DP on an annual basis, the real-time water release
may not match the real-time energy schedules and power purchases must be made. The FY 1993 budget reflects Western's
projection that approximately $700,000 per year would need to be budgeted to assure power deliveries to the P-DP
contractors. Since the derivation of the FY 1993 budget, Western has increased this projected expenditure to approximately
$2.3 million.

Comment:

 Western should reduce the projected expenditures for the period May 1993 through September 1993 to correspond to
the average of previous years. 



Response:

 Western has changed the PRS to show the most current purchased power expense for FY 1993, which reflects the flow restrictions
last year. This purchased power expense has been reduced to $5 million in FY 1993 as compared to the $6.5 million previously
shown in the addendum to the May 1992 customer brochure dated June 1993. 



Comment:

 Please extend the schedule for repayment of capitalized purchased power costs and use this tactic, along with other
adjustments to FY 1994 and FY 1995, to reduce step one for P-DP purchased power costs. 



Response:

 Western has determined through analyzing the PRS that the repayment schedule of the capitalized purchased power
cost, which is a loan to meet annual expenses, is not setting the step-one rate. The step-one rate is being set by interest
expense in FY 1995. If repayment is deferred, the interest expense actually increases. The PRS is designed to pay interest
expense before it repays any loans. Western believes the Ratesetting PRS solves for the lowest rate possible in both
steps and is in accordance with sound business principles. 



Comment:

 Western should reexamine the projections for purchased power made during the period of January through March and
in September. Many of Western's customers that serve primarily agricultural loads will have reduced loads during
these periods. Western has previously facilitated exchanges in such situations to reduce the need for purchased
power. 



Response:

 Western is willing to work with the customers in resource planning initiatives and realizes the importance to mitigate
purchased power. Western has attempted to use resource integration by exchanging energy efficiently to support
customer loads. However, this would only reduce purchased power expense if a majority of the P-DP customers could
derive load profiles that matched river regulation restrictions. 



Comment:

 Western should project some level of nonfirm sales in the upcoming years based on historic water demand and projected
water supply figures from Reclamation. A prudent projection of those revenues, including revenues that will be available
from mothballing the Yuma desalter, should be projected. 



Response:

 In the Ratesetting PRS, nonfirm sales are projected based on a historical average of revenue earned from nonfirm sales.
Currently, Western is unsure how the mothballing of the Yuma desalter will impact revenues, energy, and transmission.
Future decisions will be reflected in future rate actions. 



Comment:

 Customers would be better served if the P-DP contracts were amended to provide an option to the contractors for Western
to purchase firming energy on the contractor's behalf, or for Western to provide only the energy generated by the P-DP
project itself. 



Response:

 The Phoenix Area is receptive to meeting with the customers to discuss possible options. Western believes, however,
that any course of action chosen should be in the best interest of all parties and should be as easy to implement as possible
in order to minimize the costs of administration. 



Working Committee 





Comment:

 Western should cooperate in the formation of a process to allow customer review and input to Western's work plans projected
5 to 10 years in the future for O&M, replacements, and additions at an early enough stage of the planning cycle to
have an impact. The creation of an Engineering and Oversight Committee would provide for a safeguard against overcollection,
inflated estimates of projected expenditures, an organized dialogue with its customers, and prevent the reoccurrence
of past overspending in the future. 



Comment:

 Western should support a customer and agency working committee. Included in the working committee should be objectives
and criteria that relate to balancing the goal of safe and reliable operations with the goal of cost containment and
other economic efficiencies. A year ago, the Arizona Power Authority endorsed a proposal to create and empower a P-DP
Engineering and Oversight Committee as the structure and process for working toward price stability. Since then,
with customer involvement, Western has started two programs that provide promise for working toward the price stability
goal_the Engineering Ten-Year Plan and the transmission planning system.

Western should continue the formalization of an engineering 10-year planning process involving the P-DP customers
as initiated by Western during the spring of 1993. 



Response: 

Western supports some type of a customer and agency operational working committee. Western is committed to working
closely with the customers in the development of a customer/agency operational working committee and has, in fact,
initiated a procedure for allowing its customers more advance input into the planning process. Western has asked
the customers for their help in developing a current Engineering Ten-Year Plan. This has allowed Western to organize
dialogue with the customers and has allowed the customers to provide input on future construction activities. Western
is currently working with the customers to design criteria that will balance the goal of safe and reliable operations
with the goal of cost containment. Improved efficiencies will be a result of including the customers in the engineering
10-year planning process. Further, Western believes that the participation of the customers in developing the Engineering
Ten-Year Plan and transmission planning system, also referred to as the joint-use transmission system, is just the
beginning of involvement and partnerships Western is hoping to achieve with its customers. 



Economic Issues 





Comment: 

Western should consider emergency cost-cutting measures to help Arizona customers and small utilities through
these economic times. 



Comment: 

Western should consider the plight of irrigation customers when they pass the rate increase costs on to them. 



Comment: 

At this time, the cost of significant replacements and additions on the P-DP cause tremendous strain on Buckeye
and its customers. 



Comment: 

Western should consider the effects of the rate increases on the agricultural economy in Arizona. 



Comment: 

Western should postpone the implementation of the rate increase. 



Comment: 

Western's PAO must begin to recognize its responsibilities to consumers of Arizona, California, and Nevada and must
not forget its mission is to market and deliver low cost Federal hydropower to preference customers. 



Comment: 

There is concern about the cost increases in transmission's O&M, replacements, and additions that are substantially
greater than the rate of inflation. Based on decisions that have been made, Western should request establishing and
empowering a process for control of such costs in the future. 



Comment: 

It is requested that Western consider every possible alternative which will reduce the need for such significant
rate increases. 



Response: 

Western has reviewed its O&M and replacement costs and believes that the costs have been justified. While Western
is sympathetic to the current financial plight of a number of the customers with large agricultural loads, Western
and the Bureau believe the replacement and addition costs cannot be deferred to a later date without jeopardizing
safety and reliability. Western realizes that replacements and additions exceed the rate of inflation. However,
Western cannot allow the Parker-Davis facilities to deteriorate to a point where safe and continued operation to
all customers is jeopardized. Western is continuing to look at both its O&M and construction plans to determine
what, if any, expenditures can be avoided or delayed, without sacrificing service to its customers. 

Western believes the mission to market and deliver low-cost Federal hydropower to all customers has not been neglected.
Western is committed to work with its customers to ensure that all entities are satisfied regarding the O&M and
replacement expenditures. Western, along with the customers, will continue to review and revise O&M and replacement
costs which will meet the needs of the customers and the needs of the P-DP system. 



General Rate Issues 





Comment: 

To date, much of the frustration of the customers with Western's ratesetting process results from not understanding
Western's numbers, or where they come from, or the inconsistent sources used during the process. 



Response: 

The numbers used in the PRS are consistent with the Engineering Ten-Year Plan and with the FY 1993 budget. Western hopes
that involving the customers in the engineering 10-year planning process will result in a better understanding of
how the numbers used in the PRS are derived. 



Comment: 

Western should use the current budget in the current PRS, and use the Engineering Ten-Year Plan in future PRSs. 



Comment: 

The FY 1992 Engineering Ten-Year Plan Western is using significantly overstated Parker-Davis expenditures for
FY 1993 and FY 1994, blessed with the hindsight of an actual 1993 budget and a requested FY 1994 budget. The rates should
reflect these later realities. 



Response: 

Western chose to use the Engineering Ten-Year Plan in the Ratesetting PRS because it was the best information available
at the time. However, the PRS relies on several pieces of data. For instance, during the cost evaluation period, the
replacements and additions from the Engineering Ten-Year Plan were all in the FY 1993 congressionally approved budget.
The Engineering Ten-Year Plan varies from the FY 1993 congressionally approved budget in timing of completion of
projects and amounts to be spent in FY 1994-98. Western is currently meeting with the customers to develop a revised
Engineering Ten-Year Plan in the future that will incorporate customer input. Western plans on using the Engineering
Ten-Year Plan as a tool in developing the budgets so that, in the future, the PRS will be based on budget documents founded
in the Engineering Ten-Year Plan.

Comment:

 Clearly the use of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan is a deviation from the requirements of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. It
is for the simple reason that it does not, and indeed is not necessarily intended to, reflect only investment costs
``for which Congress has appropriated funds for construction and which will be in service within the cost evaluation
period.'' (DOE Order No. RA 6120, paragraph 10 k) As such a deviation, its use will be required to be accompanied by a
statement disclosing and justifying the deviation. (DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, paragraph 13.) Such justification
must be included in the transmittal memorandum from the Secretary to FERC or in a footnote to the reports that accompany
such transmittal. 



Response:

 All of the investments in the Ratesetting PRS are authorized power system facilities for which Congress has appropriated
funds for FY 1993 construction, and which will be in service within the cost evaluation period. Therefore, Western
believes it has complied with DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. The Engineering Ten-Year Plan was used to determine if the investments
in the FY 1993 Budget were still planned to be in service within the cost evaluation period. The Engineering Ten-Year
Plan was a better source of data to use in terms of timing of completion of construction activities and the dollars that
will be spent in years 1994-98. The appropriated budget amounts for FY 1993 were changed only to match the most
current budget information. Western believes that the Engineering Ten-Year Plan was the best data available at the
time. 



Comment:

 Reclamation should increase the rate for project use.



Response:

 Reclamation is currently reviewing the accuracy of the project use rates. If it is determined that the project use
rates require adjustment, Reclamation will take the necessary steps to implement a change in these rates. The resulting
change, if any, will be reflected in a future PRS conducted by Western. 



Comment:

 Western continues to be out of compliance with DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 which requires audits at least once every 2 years.




Response:

 Western is in compliance with DOE Order No. RA 6120.2 in that it has annual audits. Western has either had an annual consolidated
Western-wide audit or project-specific audit which both meet the criteria of DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. Currently,
P-DP is undergoing a project-specific audit. 



Comment:

 There is concern in justifying this rate increase in light of WAPA's own admission that the existing rate is adequate
to fully recover costs and meet repayment requirements for at least the next 5 years. The pinch-point methodology
used in the PRS for determining the rates is doing the customers a disservice. 



Comment:

 The establishment of the current rate based upon anticipated revenue requirements in FY 2047 is unreasonable. 



Response:

 P-DP's PRSs are required to repay each dollar of investment with interest within a period not to exceed 50 years.
The use of the pinch-point methodology and the longstanding practice of repaying investment with interest within
50 years are justified and identified in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. Section 12 of the Order describes the guidelines for
the cost recovery criteria which is what the pinch-point methodology accomplishes. The pinch-point in the Ratesetting
PRS is FY 2047. This pinch-point is due to a required payment needed to fully repay an investment within a 50-year period.




Comment:

 There is disagreement with Western's classification process for capitalizing versus expensing. O&M expense
costs should be classified as a capital cost and amortized over the expected service life of the facility involved.
Specifically, vehicle expenditures were classified as expense rather than capitalized. 



Response:

 Vehicle expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized and it is Western's policy to expense minor replacements
($5,000 or less) and capitalize major replacements (over $5,000). However, the particular budget document that
is being questioned contains a significant number of (i) expendable communication items and (ii) electrical test
equipment, in addition to several vehicles. The service lives of the communication items and test equipment is sufficiently
short enough to justify expensing the costs of said equipment. Due to the fact that only a small portion of the costs
of the budget document were related to the purchase of vehicles, a decision was made to expense the entire budgeted
amount. 



Comment:

 Customer feels Western should withdraw its proposal regarding the expansion of its area load control boundaries
to the Basic Substation. They feel Western has no justification for this proposal and there are no benefits.

Response: 

Western does not believe this comment pertains to, or has any impact on, the P-DP provisional rates. However,
Western has withdrawn the proposal to expand Western's load control boundaries to Basic Substation. 


Comment:

 Western is accelerating repayments to periods far shorter than the average or expected service life of the facilities
involved. Capital investments are being amortized over unduly short periods. 


Response: 

The PRS program is designed to solve at the lowest rate possible that is consistent with sound business principles.
The PRS program is designed to calculate a rate over a 50-year period. However, the program will repay investment in
a shorter period of time to minimize interest expense, providing revenue is available to accomplish this. If capital
investment repayment was deferred, then interest expense would increase, which could result in a higher rate. 


Comment: 

P-DP has an additional 30 MW of firm capacity because Hoover is providing the P-DP spinning reserves. However,
Western should not transfer revenue to the Hoover project with regard to spinning reserves. 


Response: 

Western has researched this matter thoroughly and can find no evidence that Hoover is providing spinning reserves
to the P-DP. Although the Consolidated Marketing Plan anticipated that an additional 30 MW of P-DP capacity
would be available for sale as a result of consolidated operations within the Boulder City Area (now the Phoenix Area),
spinning reserve requirements have not changed. The PAO operations department, in conjunction with a consultant
on loan from MWD, is continuing to investigate this issue. Any identified benefits to the P-DP will be reflected
in future PRSs. 


Comment: 

Customer objects to the continuance of Western's 1989 decision to change the costs for using the Hoover-Basic and
Hoover-Mead-Basic transmission lines and Basic Substation from a facilities use charge to the postage-stamp rate
for the entire P-DP transmission system. 
Western should revise its proposed P-DP rate adjustments in a manner that restores the Hoover-Basic and Hoover-Mead-Basic
transmission lines and the Basic Substation to a facilities use charge which covers the actual costs associated with
use of these facilities. 


Response: 

Western does not believe that this comment pertains to or impacts the P-DP provisional rates. 


Comment: 

The customers are concerned that they may be paying twice for the same service since Mead is already part of the P-DP.
Western is already charging Edison $0.624/kW/year for use of the substation under their existing agreement. 


Response: 

Western has reviewed the provisions concerning the Mead facilities charges in the P-DP transmission agreements
and has determined that there is no double accounting to the customers for the same capital facilities. In determining
Mead facilities charges to Parker-Davis transmission customers, the costs of the Mead facilities, replacements,
and O&M expenses are first allocated to the P-DP based upon the number of functions used. This allocation
is further allocated based upon the transmission capacity as stated in the contracts. 


Environmental Evaluation 


In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.; 

Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508); and DOE NEPA Regulations (10 CFR Part
1021), Western has determined that this action is categorically excluded from the preparation of the environmental
assessment or EIS. 


Executive Order 12866 


DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive
Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866;
accordingly, no clearance of this notice by OMB is required. 


Availability of Information 


Information regarding these P-DP rate adjustments, including PRSs, comments, letters, memorandums, and
other supporting material made or kept by Western for the purpose of developing the P-DP power rates, is available
for public review in the Phoenix Area Office, Western Area Power Administration, Office of the Assistant Area Manager

Notification of Request for Research Assistance; Program Development and Evaluation Environmental Monitoring
and Assessment Program Estuaries_Louisianian and West Indian Provinces 


Agency: 

Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory, Gulf Breeze, Florida. 



Action: 

Notification of Request for Research Assistance. 




Summary: 

The EMAP-Estuaries (EMAP-E) research program develops strategies to define its monitoring program,
interpret results, and extrapolate the findings of the experimental monitoring systems to different time and spatial
scales as well as various pollutant/environmental scenarios. Assistance is requested of cooperating institutions
to develop indices of estuarine condition and evaluate effectiveness of the imposed sampling and processing regimes.
Each area of cooperation also presents additional research possibilities that extend beyond the basic EMAP concept.





Areas of Research: 

(One cooperative agreement is expected to be awarded for each area.)



_Validation of the EMAP Benthic Index and joint development of alternate benthic indices for the Louisianian Province
(LP). The goal is to further develop the relationship between abiotic and biotic benthic factors. This research incorporates
the collection of biotic and abiotic data on benthic samples (i.e., sediment toxicity, abundance and diversity of
organisms, silt/clay content) from each EMAP-LP site and correlation of the information with other field data
collected. 
_Evaluation of levels of contaminants in sediments and fish tissue to determine nominal and subnominal levels of
contamination and identification of which contaminant is most prevalent and of most ecological concern, and adjustments
of raw concentration based on environmental condition. The joint development of an index of contaminant stress is
strongly desired. This extends to both organismal and system-level assessments. 
_Joint development of an index of the trophic state of estuarine systems. This includes the selection of parameters
to be measured (e.g., nutrient levels, productivity, stable isotope ratios) and the development of protocols for
sample collection and analysis.

 

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Cooperative agreements are intended to promote collaborative interaction with EPA researchers. Selectees will
be expected to collaborate with EMAP personnel and other EMAP researchers in their areas of research. The ongoing
research may require the combination of all analytical results towards the development of new condition indices.

<DOCTITLE>Revision of the Kansas National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program To Authorize the Issuance
of General Permits </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Approval of the NPDES General Permits Program of the State of Kansas.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 24, 1993, the Regional Administrator for the EPA, Region VII, approved the State of Kansas' NPDES General
Permits Program. This action authorizes the State of Kansas to issue general permits in lieu of individual NPDES permits.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


EPA regulations at 40 CFR 122.28 provide for the issuance of general permits to regulate discharges of wastewater
which result from substantially similar operations, contain the same types of wastes, require the same effluent
limitations or operating conditions, require similar monitoring, and are appropriately controlled under a general
permit rather than individual permits.
Kansas was authorized to administer the NPDES Permit Program in 1974. As previously approved, the State's program
did not include provisions for the issuance of general permits. There are several categories of discharges which
could appropriately be regulated by general permits in Kansas, including storm water. Therefore, the Kansas Department
of Health and Environment requested a revision of its NPDES program to provide for issuance of general permits.
Each general permit will be subject to EPA review as provided by 40 CFR 123.44. Public notice and opportunity to request
a hearing is also provided or each general permit.


II. Discussion


The State of Kansas submitted, in support of its request, a Program Description and revised NPDES Memorandum of Agreement
between EPA and the State, as well as copies of relevant statutes and regulations. The State also submitted a statement
by the Attorney General certifying, with appropriate citations to the statues and regulations, that the State has
adequate legal authority to administer a general permit program consistent with the applicable federal regulations.
Based upon Kansas' submission and its experience in administering an approved NPDES program, EPA has concluded that
the State will have the necessary approved procedures and resources to administer the general permits program.
Under 40 CFR 123.62, NPDES program revisions are either substantial (requiring publication of proposed program
approval in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment) or non-substantial (where approval may be granted by letter from EPA to the State). EPA has determined
that assumption by Kansas of general permit authority is a non-substantial revision of its NPDES program. EPA has
generally viewed approval of such authority as non-substantial because it does not alter the substantive obligations
of any discharger under the State program, but merely simplifies the procedures by which permits are issued to a number
of similar point sources.
Moreover, under the approved program, the State retains authority to issue individual permits where appropriate,
and any person may request the State to issue an individual permit to a discharger otherwise eligible for general permit
coverage. While not required under 40 CFR 123.62, EPA is publishing notice of this approval action to keep the public
informed of the status of its general permit program approvals.

III. Federal Register Notice of Approval of State NPDES Program or Modifications.




The following table provides the public with an up-to-date list of the status of State NPDES permitting authority
throughout the country. Today's 

Federal Register

 notice is to announce the approval of Kansas' authority to issue general permits.



IV. Review Under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant
to Section 8(b) of that Order.


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
which may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(d) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), I certify that this State General Permit Program will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Approval of the Kansas NPDES State General Permit Program establishes
no new substantive requirements, nor does it alter the regulatory control over any industrial category. Approval
of the Kansas NPDES State General Permit Program merely provides a simplified administrative process.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; Census Data for Disclosure Statements and Aggregate MSA Reports</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) announces the availability for purchase of census
data that the FFIEC will use in preparing the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) individual disclosure statements
and aggregate reports for calendar year 1994. The FFIEC's 1994 census data file, which reflects data from the Bureau
of the Census's 1990 decennial Census of Population and Housing, includes information on the population, income,
and housing characteristics of census tracts that fall within the geographic boundaries of metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs) that were established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its announcement of June 30, 1993.
These census data are used by the FFIEC to prepare tables for individual disclosure statements relating to the disposition
of mortgage loan applications based on the characteristics (racial composition, income characteristics, and income
and racial composition) of the census tracts to which the loan applications relate. The census data also are used to
prepare two tables in the aggregate reports. Lending institutions covered by HMDA do not need the FFIEC's census data
file to prepare their loan register data submissions, but institutions may find the census data useful for conducting
analyses of their institution's lending activity. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires lending institutions located in metropolitan areas to report annually
information on the geographic distribution of their home purchase and home improvement loans, and also to provide
certain information about loan applicants and borrowers. Covered lenders submit a loan application register to
their supervisory agency (the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, or the Department
of Housing and Urban Development) on which they record the location of the property to which the loan or application
relates (MSA, state, county, and census tract) for metropolitan areas in which they have an office, as well as information
about the race or national origin, sex, and income of applicants and borrowers for such applications. The Federal
Reserve Board, on behalf of member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and HUD, processes
the data and prepares individual disclosure statements for reporting institutions and also prepares aggregate
reports for all lenders in each metropolitan area. The individual disclosure statements are made available to the
public by each covered institution and by central data depositories in each MSA; the aggregate reports are available
at the central data depositories. 



The census data now available from the FFIEC are the data that the FFIEC will use to prepare Tables 7-1 through
7-6, which are contained both in the individual disclosure statements and in the aggregate reports, and to prepare
Table 9 and Table 10 of the aggregate reports. Lending institutions do not need the FFIEC's census file in order to prepare
their HMDA-LAR for submission to their supervisory agencies, but they may obtain the census data if they plan
to conduct statistical analyses examining the demographics of the census tracts in which they make loans. 

Included in the FFIEC's 1994 census file is information on the median family income of each census tract together with
an estimated median family income for each MSA. These data were obtained by the FFIEC from the 1990 decennial Census
of Population and Housing, and reflect information pertaining to the geographic boundaries for MSAs that were established
by the Office of Management and Budget in their June 30, 1993, announcement of MSA designations. One consequence of
these new OMB designations is that the median family income estimates for roughly 100 MSAs will have changed as a reflection
of the addition or deletion of geographic areas to these MSAs. It should be noted that these revisions in estimates
of median family income do not reflect updated surveys of consumers, but rather the effects of the redefinitions of
MSA boundaries by OMB. 

The FFIEC uses the median family income estimates contained in the census data file for categorizing census tracts
into one of three income categories_low or moderate income, middle income and upper income_when the FFIEC produces
the HMDA disclosure reports. The FFIEC notes that as a consequence of OMB's June 1993 changes in MSA boundaries_and
the resulting revised MSA median family income estimates_some census tracts may no longer fall into the income category
that they were previously assigned. For example, some tracts previously categorized as low or moderate income may
now be categorized as middle income. For the most part the changes are small, but for some MSAs the revised income estimates
are more significant. 

For categorizing applicant income relative to the median income for each MSA, the FFIEC uses estimates of median family
income that are published by HUD each year. The HUD figures are more current than the income data from the Bureau of the
Census. (A description of the precise methodology used by HUD to calculate their estimates of current MSA median family
incomes can be obtained from the FFIEC.) The estimates of median family income that will apply to the categorization
of the 1994 HMDA data are not yet available from HUD, and thus are not contained on the FFIEC data tape. The HUD figures
will affect Tables 3, 4-1 through 4-6, 5-1 through 5-6, 6-1 through 6-6, and 8-1
through 8-6. 

The 1994 census data file is available for purchase on magnetic tape for $250. A copy of the HMDA Data order form can be
obtained from the Federal Reserve Board by telephoning the Board's automated answering system at (202) 452-2016,
which can provide the order form by mail or by fax transmission.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Proposed New Systems of Records</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of new systems of records.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board)
is establishing two new systems of records to be maintained and used by the Board's Office of the Inspector General.
The two systems are called 

OIG Investigative Records

 (BGFRS/OIG-1) and 

OIG Personnel Records

 (BGFRS/OIG-2). Previously, information contained in the first system was maintained as part of the Board's personnel
systems of records. The second system identified above includes the OIG's database management and work assignment
and tracking system and contains personal and employment information on OIG personnel. Changes to that system have
caused that system to be subject to the Privacy Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Board's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) performs its duties in accordance with the Inspector General Act
of 1978, as amended by the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 95-452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.) (IG Act).
The OIG is an independent unit within the Board which was established to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness
in the administration of Board programs and operations and to detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in such programs
and operations.


The Board is establishing two new systems of records, pursuant to the Privacy Act, entitled: (1) 

OIG Investigative Records

, and (2) 

OIG Personnel Records

. These systems of records are essential for the Board's OIG to perform the duties assigned to that Office by the IG Act.
The system called 

OIG Investigative Records

 (designated BGFRS/OIG-1 below) will consist of files and records compiled by the OIG on Board employees or other persons
involved with the Board's programs or operations who have been or are under investigation for criminal or civil fraud
and abuse related to the Board's programs or operations. The Board's Inspector General has the authority to conduct
such an investigation under the IG Act. These files and records include materials maintained in electronic and hard
copy form including databases for case tracking, ``Hotline'' telephone call logs, investigator notes, case files,
and memoranda or letters.
The system of records called 

OIG Personnel Records

 (designated BGFRS/OIG-2 below) will consist of files and records compiled by the OIG on past, current, and prospective
employees of the OIG for use in the management of the Board's OIG. These files and records include materials maintained
in electronic or hard copy form, several databases including the OIG Time Entry System, and files on individual employees
maintained and used by the OIG. The information in the system of records is used for making and tracking assignments
and for assessing individual employee progress on assignments as well as for evaluating employees.
The Board proposes to exempt certain files within these two new systems of records from disclosure to individuals
who are the subject of a record in the system. The exemptions would cover only files compiled for the following purposes:
(1) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes; and
(2) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications
for employment by the OIG, but only to the extent the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source
who furnished information to the Board or OIG under an express promise of confidentiality.


This information in these two new systems is proposed to be exempt under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the system of records designated as 

OIG Investigative Records

 (BGFRS/OIG-1) also shall be exempt from certain parts of the Privacy Act insofar as the records are maintained by a
Board component which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal
laws and which consists of:
(i) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders;
(ii) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators,
and associated with an identifiable individual; or
(iii) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws
from arrest or indictment through release from supervision.


The system is exempt from the provisions for the following reasons: notifying an individual at the individual's request
of the existence of records in a criminal investigative file pertaining to such individual, or granting access to
such an investigative file could:


(A) Interfere with investigative and enforcement proceedings and with co-defendants' right to a fair trial;
(B) Disclose the identity of confidential sources and reveal confidential information supplied by these sources;
(C) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; and
(D) Be inconsistent with Federal laws and rules governing disclosure of such information in certain circumstances.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), a report of these new systems of records is being filed with the President of the
Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. These
new systems of records will become effective on April 8, 1994, without further notice, unless the Board publishes
a notice to the contrary in the 

Federal Register

.
Accordingly, the Board proposes the establishment of the following system of records.


BGFRS/OIG-1


System name:


OIG Investigative Records.


System location:


Office of Inspector General, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Suite 1070, 1850 K Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20006.


Categories of individuals covered by the system:


Individuals covered consist of:
(1) Officers or employees of the Board or other persons involved in the Board's programs or operations who are or have
been under investigation by the Board's Office of Inspector General in order to determine whether such officers,
employees or other persons have been or are engaging in fraud and abuse with respect to the Board's programs or operations;
and
(2) Complainants and witnesses where necessary for future retrieval.


Categories of records in the system:


The system contains files on individual investigations including investigative reports and related documents
generated during the course of or subsequent to an investigation. It includes electronic and hard copy case tracking
systems, databases containing investigatory information, ``Hotline'' telephone logs, and investigator workpapers
and memoranda and letter referrals to management or others.


Authority for maintenance of the system:


5 U.S.C. App. 4(a)(1) and 6(a)(2).


Purpose(s):


These records are collected, maintained and used by the OIG in its inquiries and investigations and reports relating
to the administration of the Board's programs and operations and to manage the investigatory program.


Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and purposes of such uses:


Under normal circumstances, no individually identifiable records will be provided. However, under those unusual
circumstances when release of information contained in an individually identifiable record is required, proper
safeguards will be maintained to protect the information collected from unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Subject to this general limitation, the routine uses are as follows:
1. In the event the information in the system of records indicates a violation or potential violation of a criminal
or civil law, rule, or regulation, the relevant records may be disclosed to the appropriate federal, state, or local
agency or authority responsible for investigating or prosecuting such a violation or for enforcing or implementing
a statute, rule, or regulation.
2. The information in the system of records may be disclosed to a court, magistrate, or administrative tribunal in
the course of presenting evidence, including disclosures to counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery,
litigation, or settlement negotiations or in connection with criminal proceedings.
3. The information may be disclosed to a congressional office in response to an inquiry made by that office at the request
of the individual who is the subject of the records.
4. The information may be disclosed to any source, including a federal, state, or local agency maintaining civil,
criminal, or other relevant enforcement information or other pertinent information, but only to the extent necessary
for the OIG to obtain information relevant to an OIG investigation.
5. The information maybe disclosed in order to respond to a federal agency's request made in connection with the hiring
or retention of an individual, the issuance of a security clearance, the reporting of an investigation of an individual,
the letting of a contract or issuance of a grant, license, or other benefit by the requesting agency, but only to the
extent that the information disclosed is necessary and relevant to the requesting agency's decision on the matter.
6. The information may be disclosed to other federal entities, such as other federal Offices of Inspector General
or the General Accounting Office, or to a private party with which the OIG or the Board has contracted for the purpose
of auditing or reviewing the performance or internal management of the OIG's investigatory program, provided the
record will not be transferred in a form that is individually identifiable, and provided further that the entity acknowledges
in writing that it is required to maintain Privacy Act safeguards for the information.
In addition to the foregoing routine uses, a record which is contained in this system and derived from another Board
system of records may be disclosed as a routine use as specified in the 

Federal Register

 notice of the system of records from which the records derived.


Policies and Practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining and disposing of records in the system:
Storage:


These records are maintained in file folders, computer disks, electronic media, and reports on each investigation.


Retrievability:


Records are generally indexed by name of person under investigation, investigation number, referral number, or
investigative subject matter.


Safeguards:


File folders are maintained in lockable metal file cabinets stored in offices that are locked when not in use. Computer
disks and electronic media are locked in the lockable metal file cabinets with their related file folders, and information
not so lockable is kept in individual offices in locked or passworded computer hardware. Access to the information
in the cabinets and individual offices is permitted only by and to specifically authorized personnel.


Retention and disposal:


Records in file folders are retained as long as needed and then destroyed by shredding. Computer disks are cleared,
retired, or destroyed when no longer useful. Entries on electronic media are deleted or erased when no longer needed.


System manager and address:


Brent L Bowen, Inspector General, Mail Stop 300, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC
20551. Office location is Suite 1070, 1850 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20006.


Notification procedure:

DC 20551. Individuals requesting their own records must provide their name and address and a notarized statement
attesting to the individual's identity. Requests submitted on behalf of other persons must include their written,
notarized authorization. Such requests in the form prescribed may also be presented in person at the Office of the
Inspector General, Suite 1070, 1850 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20006. Simultaneously with requesting notification
of inclusion in this system of records, the individual may request record access as described in the following section
on ``Record access procedures.''


Record access procedures:


Specific materials in this system have been exempted from Privacy Act provisions at 5U.S.C. 552a(d), regarding access
to records. The section of this notice titled ``Exemptions claimed for the system'' indicates the kinds of material
exempted and the reasons for exempting them from access. Individuals wishing to request access to non-exempt records
should follow the procedures described in the ``Notification procedure'' section. Requests submitted on behalf
of other persons must include their written, notarized authorization. If access to such information by a subject
individual is deemed consistent with the purposes for which this system of records has been established, then the
individual will be notified by the OIG as to the time and place for access to the records. The OIG will also notify individuals
when access is denied.


Contesting record procedure:


Individuals requesting amendment or contesting records in this system of records should contact the OIG at the address
given above, reasonably identify the records, specify the information being contested, the rationale for the challenge,
and supply the information requested to be substituted. Such individuals must also comply with the Board's Privacy
Act regulations on ``Request for correction or amendment of record'' (12 CFR 261a.7).


Record source categories: 


The OIG collects information from many sources including the subject individuals, employees of the Board and the
Federal Reserve System, other government employees, witnesses and informants, and nongovernmental sources.

(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f) to the extent the system of records consists of investigatory material compiled for
law enforcement purposes. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. (k)(5), this system of records is exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)
to the extent that it consists of investigatory material compiled for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications for federal civilian employment or federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity
of a source who furnished confidential information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of
the source would be held in confidence. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), this system of records is exempted from 5U.S.C.
552a(c)(3), (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) to the extent that it consists of information compiled for

 What are the short-term and long-term adverse effects for the infant and mother?

 What are the economic consequences of this treatment?

 What is the influence of type of corticosteroid, dosage, timing and circumstances of administration, and
associated therapy on treatment outcome?

 What are the recommendations for use of antenatal corticosteroids?

 What research is needed to guide clinical care?

On the final day of the meeting, the consensus panel chairman will read the draft statement to the conference audience
and invite comments and questions.

of water rights shall become effective as of the date the Secretary of the Interior causes to be published a statement
of findings as prescribed in section 412(a)(1) through 412(a)(8). Accordingly, in compliance with section 412(a),

SUMMARY: 

The United States Forest Service proposes that a 100-acre withdrawal for the Baldwin, Water Canyon, and Monica Administrative

have been and will remain open to mineral leasing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The United States Forest Service proposes that the existing land withdrawal made by Public Land Order No. 3378, be

The areas described aggregate 100 acres in Socorro and Catron Counties.




The purpose of the withdrawal is to protect the Baldwin, Water Canyon, and Monica Administrative Sites in the Cibola

leasing laws. No change is proposed in the purpose or segregative effect of the withdrawal.

For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection
with the proposed withdrawal continuation may present their views in writing to the State Director in the New Mexico
State Office.

The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine
the existing and potential demand for the lands and their resources. A report will also be prepared for consideration
by the Secretary of the Interior, the President, and the Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal
will be continued and, if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published
in the 

Federal Register.

 The existing withdrawal will continue until such final determination is made.

 Notice of availability. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The NRC is announcing the availability for public comment of a draft report, NUREG-1022, Revision 1, ``Event
Reporting Guidelines, Second Draft Report for Comment.'' 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NRC has prepared a draft report, NUREG-1022, Revision 1, ``Event Reporting Guidelines, Second Draft Report
for Comment.'' The document provides proposed clarification of the immediate notification requirements of 10 CFR
50.72 and the 30-day written licensee event report (LER) requirements of 10 CFR 50.73 for nuclear power plants. This
document will replace NUREG-1022 and its Supplements 1 and 2. 


The purposes of this document are to ensure events are reported as required by improving the reporting guidelines
related to 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 and to consolidate these guidelines into a single reference document. 
The NRC staff is seeking public comment before finalizing the revised NUREG because of the broad interest in event
reporting at nuclear power plants. The staff requests that comments be limited to the same scope as the document, which
involves clarifying but not changing the reporting requirements in   50.72 and 50.73.

Previous Draft and Comment 



The availability of the first draft report for public comment was announced on October 7, 1991 (56 FR 50598). The comment
period, which was extended on November 25, 1991 (56 FR 59303), expired on January 31, 1992. 

The issues raised by public comments were discussed at a meeting on May 7, 1992, and consensus was reached for a number
of the issues. The NRC staff's summary of the May 7, 1992, meeting is provided in a memorandum for T. Novak from P. Baranowsky,
dated June 3, 1992, Subject: Summary of Meeting with NUMARC, BWROG LER/JCO Committee, and Others on Comments on Draft
NUREG-1022, Revision 1. 

On April 8, 1993, the NRC staff issued an agenda for a second meeting (58 FR 18167) which provided proposed resolutions
for remaining issues. These matters were then discussed at the second meeting on May 6, 1993, where consensus was reached
for a number of additional issues. The NRC staff's summary of the May 6, 1993 meeting, which includes a verbatim transcript,
is provided in a memorandum for G. Holahan from P. Baranowsky, dated May 20, 1993, subject: Summary of Public Meeting
on the Issues Raised by Public Comment on Draft NUREG-1022, Revision 1. 



Noteworthy Issues 



Reviewers should note that, in the second draft, shaded text indicates reporting guidance that is considered to be
new or different, in a meaningful way, from previously published generic reporting guidance. It does not indicate
changes made relative to the first draft. 

Reviewers may wish to take note of the following principal differences from the positions proposed in the previous


Federal Register

 notice of April 8, 1993 (58 FR 18167): 

(1) Actual threats. Following discussions at the meeting of May 6, 1993, the text has been revised so that minor events
are not portrayed as constituting actual threats to plant safety. (Section 3.2.5 beginning on page 40 and Section
3.2.8 beginning on page 50.) 

(2) Timeliness. As discussed at the meeting of May 6, 1993, text has been revised to specifically state that the timeliness
guidance in Generic Letter 91-18, which applies primarily to operability determinations, is also appropriate
for reportability determinations. (Section 2.11 on page 17) 

(3) Outside design basis. As discussed at the meeting of May 6, 1993, the text has been revised to make it clear that the
staff's position regarding long-term incapability of a single train does not include cases of technical inoperability
or minor time infractions. In addition, as a partial response to industry comments, the wording of this position has
been revised to eliminate statements about ``assuming an additional single failure'' within the system. Instead,
the wording now indicates that the plant is outside of its design basis because the system does not have the ``suitable
redundancy'' required by the General Design Criteria as a minimum design criterion for the system. However, the position
has not been retracted. (Section 3.2.4 on page 37.) 

Reviewers may also wish to note the following points: 

(1) Section 2.1. Engineering judgment should be supported by a logical thought process. (page 11) 

(2) Section 2.7. Discussion has been included to address multiple relief valve failures. (pages 13 and 14) 

(3) Section 3.2.7. Eight hours is considered a ``short time'' with regard to loss of assessment equipment which is
rarely used. In addition, individual licensee procedures are, in essence, cited as the authority with regard to loss
of response equipment such as sirens. (page 47) 

(4) Section 3.2.8. Significant hampering includes hypothetical demands, i.e., site personnel were or ``would be''
significantly hampered. In addition, precautionary evacuations are not reportable unless there is significant
hampering. (page 51) 

(5) Section 3.3.2. The logic indicates that automatic or inadvertent actuations of single ESF components are generally
not reportable because single components of complex systems usually do not mitigate the consequences of an event.
However, deliberate operator actuations of one or more components of an ESF in response to plant conditions in order
to mitigate the consequences of an event, such as starting an ECCS pump in response to rapidly dropping pressurizer
level, are reportable. (page 57) Also, the text requests that licensees report, on a voluntary basis if need be, actuations
of specific listed systems. This is the same position as proposed previously by the staff. (page 59) In this regard,
the staff also intends to communicate clearly that guidance regarding voluntary reporting is not enforceable. 

(6) Section 3.3.3. The text now provides considerable discussion and a number of examples taken directly from previous
guidance. (Section 3.3.3 begins on page 65) 

(7) Section 4. The text reflects recent changes in the telephone systems used for emergency telecommunications.




Organization of Comments 



Commenters are encouraged to be specific. Comments may be submitted as proposed modified text for the NUREG that encompasses
their comments, or as discussions of example conditions or events that illustrate a particular point regarding reportability.
To assist in producing efficient and complete comment resolution, commenters are requested to reference the numbered
section(s) in the draft NUREG (for example, Section 3.3.4) and page number(s) related to their comments, where possible.




Submittal of Comments in an Electronic Format 



Commenters are encouraged to submit, in addition to the original paper copy, a copy of their comments in an electronic
format on IBM compatible, DOS formatted 3.5 or 5.25 inch diskettes. The text format and software version should be
identified on the label of the diskette.

(Order Modifying and Suspending Byproduct Material License No. 37-28179-01); Hearing (Staff Order
Modifying and Suspending License Effective Immediately) 



February 1, 1994.


Before Administrative Judges: G. Paul Bollwerk, III, Chairman, Dr. Charles N. Kelber, Dr. Peter S. Lam.




By immediately effective order dated November 16, 1993, the NRC staff suspended Byproduct Material License No. 37-28179-01.
Under that license, Indiana Regional Cancer Center (IRCC) is authorized to use a strontium-90 source for the treatment
of superficial eye conditions. The order also modified the license to prohibit Dr. James Bauer, the IRCC Radiation
Safety Officer and the only authorized user on the license, from engaging in any activities under the license. The
order further provided that on or before December 6, 1993, the licensee, Dr. Bauer, or any other person adversely affected
by the order could submit an answer to the order, which could include a request for a hearing.
On December 2, 1993, IRCC and Dr. Bauer filed a request for a hearing regarding the order. The Commission referred this
filing to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel on December 13, 1993, for the appointment of a presiding officer
to conduct any necessary proceedings. On December 14, 1993, the Chief Administrative Judge of the Panel appointed
this Atomic Safety and Licensing Board pursuant to the Commission's referral. (58 FR 67,427). The Board consists
of Dr. Charles N. Kelber, Dr. Peter S. Lam, and G. Paul Bollwerk, III, who will serve as Chairman of the Board.
On January 26, 1994, the Board conducted a prehearing conference in this proceeding. On February 1, 1994, the Board
issued an unpublished prehearing conference order in which it ruled on various discovery and scheduling matters.

Please take notice that a hearing will be conducted in this proceeding. The parties to the hearing are the NRC staff,
IRCC, and Dr. Bauer. This hearing will be governed by the hearing procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 2, subpart G (10
CFR 2.700-.790).
During the course of the proceeding, the Board may conduct an oral argument, as provided in 10 CFR 2.755, and may hold
additional prehearing conferences pursuant to 10 CFR 2.752. The public is invited to attend any oral argument, prehearing
conference, or evidentiary hearing, which may be held pursuant to 10 CFR 2.750-.751. The Board will establish
the schedules for any such sessions at a later date, through notices to be published in the 

Federal Register 

and/or made available to the public at NRC Public Document Rooms.
In accordance with 10 CFR 2.715(a), any person, not a party to the proceeding, may submit a written limited appearance
statement setting forth his or her position on the issues in this proceeding. These statements do not constitute evidence
but may assist the Board and/or parties in the definition of the issues being considered. Written limited appearance
statements should be sent to the office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. A copy of the statement also should be served on the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board. The Board will make a determination at a later date whether oral limited appearance statements
will be entertained.
Documents relating to this proceeding are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room,
the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

(Order Suspending Byproduct Material License No. 37-28540-01); Hearing (Staff Order Suspending License

February 1, 1994.

On January 20, 1993, the NRC staff issued an immediately effective order suspending Byproduct Materials License
No. 37-28540-01. (58 FR 6825). That license authorizes Oncology Services Corporation (OSC) to use sealed-source
iridium-192 for high dose rate (HDR) human brachytherapy treatments in six OSC facilities in Pennsylvania. As justification
for the order, the staff cited a number of circumstances that it asserted demonstrated ``a significant corporate
management breakdown in the control of licensed activities'' (58 FR at 6826), including a November 1992 incident
at OSC's Indiana (Pennsylvania) Regional Cancer Center in which a patient given an HDR brachytherapy treatment was
returned to her nursing home with a iridium-192 source mistakenly still inside her body.
The January 1993 order provided that on or before February 20, 1993, licensee OSC or any other person adversely affected
by the order could submit an answer to the order, which could include a request for a hearing. On February 2, 1993, OSC
filed a request for a hearing regarding the order. The Commission referred this submission to the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board Panel on February 5, 1993, for the appointment of a presiding officer to conduct any necessary proceedings.
On February 10, 1993, the Chief Administrative Judge of the Panel appointed this Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
pursuant to the Commission's referral. (58 FR 9224). The Board consists of Dr. Charles N. Kelber, Dr. Peter S. Lam,
and G. Paul Bollwerk, III, who will serve as Chairman of the Board.
On February 23, 1993, the staff filed the first of a series of motions asking for a delay of the proceeding so as not to
interfere with various ongoing investigations relating to some of the circumstances forming the basis for the suspension
order. Acting on these requests, the Board delayed the beginning of discovery by the parties through early December
1993. See LBP-93-6, 37 NRC 207, 

vacated in part as moot, 

CLI-93-17, 38 NRC 44 (1993); LBP-93-10, 37 NRC 455, 

aff'd, 

CLI-93-17, 38 NRC 44, (1993); LBP-93-20, 38 NRC 130 (1993). By letter dated November 16, 1993,
the staff informed the Board that it would not request any further delays in the proceeding as a result of the investigations.
As a consequence, on January 26, 1994, the Board conducted a prehearing conference. Thereafter, on February 1, 1994,
the Board issued an unpublished prehearing conference order in which it ruled on various discovery and scheduling
matters.
Please take notice that a hearing will be conducted in this proceeding. The parties to the hearing are the NRC staff
and OSC. The hearing will be governed by the hearing procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 2, subpart G (10 CFR 2.700-.790).
During the course of the proceeding, the Board may conduct an oral argument, as provided in 10 CFR 2.755, and may hold
additional prehearing conferences pursuant to 10 CFR 2.752. The public is invited to attend any oral argument or prehearing
conference, as well as any evidentiary hearing, which may be held pursuant to 10 CFR 2.750-.751. The Board will
establish the schedules for any such sessions at a later date, through notices to be published in the 

Federal Register

 and/or made available to the public at NRC Public Document Rooms.
In accordance with 10 CFR 2.715(a), any person, not a party to the proceeding, may submit a written limited appearance
statement setting forth his or her position on the issues in this proceeding. These statements do not constitute evidence
but may assist the Board and/or parties in the definition of the issues being considered. Written limited appearance
statements should be sent to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. A copy of the statement also should be served on the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board. The Board will make a determination at a later date whether oral limited appearance statements
will be entertained.
Documents relating to this proceeding are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room,
the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Panel on the Engineered Barrier System Looks at Engineered Barrier Research, Tours Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Panel on the Engineered Barrier System will hold a one-day meeting
on March 10, 1994, on current and planned research on the engineered barriers that could be used in a potential repository
at Yucca Mountain. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the Department of Energy
(DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level
waste. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at the Sheraton Inn, 5115 Hopyard Road, Pleasanton, California
94588; telephone (510) 460-8800; fax (510) 847-9455.

An important focus of the meeting will be the DOE's strategy and timing for determining what the long-term corrosion
performance will be for materials_particularly modern materials such as stainless steels and nickel alloys. The
Board also is interested in current and future linkages between engineered barrier system research and performance
assessment and in the corrosion models to be used in the next total systems performance assessment.

Other subjects to be covered include (in-repository) criticality control, the DOE's plans and timing for developing
research on filler materials for canisters, changes in engineered barrier system research plans due to the evolution
of the waste package design, the effects of human materials and products on repository performance, and the potential
for corrosion influenced by microbes in an unsaturated repository. The Board has invited representatives from the
DOE and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to make presentations at the meeting.

On Friday, March 11, 1994, LLNL representatives will conduct a brief morning tour of the laboratory facilities, ending
no later than noon. Transportation for the tour will be provided by the laboratory. The tour is open to the public, but
space is limited, and all who wish to attend must preregister as soon as possible. Submit the following information
to Frank Randall at the Board's offices (Tel: 703-235-4473; Fax: 703-235-4495) 

no later than February 17,

 1994: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, place of birth, date of birth, and your
business name and address. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when beginning the tour. Please

<DOCTITLE>Structural Geology & Geoengineering Panel; Tectonics Meeting</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's (the Board) Panel on Structural Geology & Geoengineering
will hold a two-day meeting on tectonics on March 8-9, 1994. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held
at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, San Francisco Airport, 600 Airport Blvd., Burlingame, California 94010; telephone
(415) 340-8500; fax (415) 340-0599.
The focus of the panel meeting will be the methodology, existing results, and uses of probabilistic seismic and volcanic
hazard estimates at Yucca Mountain. A site at Yucca Mountain currently is being characterized by the Department of
Energy (DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense
high-level waste. The DOE has assigned a key role to probabilistic hazard estimation in determining site suitability
and the design and licensability of the proposed repository.
During the panel meeting, the DOE will discuss probabilistic seismic and volcanic hazard estimation and its uses
as presented in two reports: (1) The DOE topical report on seismic hazards assessment and (2) the Los Alamos National
Laboratory report on volcanic hazard studies. In addition, the Board has asked for an update on recent seismological
and geologic investigations that have a bearing on hazard estimation.
The Board has invited other interested parties, such as the state of Nevada, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and
their contractors, to comment on the DOE's presentations and present the latest results of similar studies on Yucca
Mountain. The Board also has invited a number of eminent outside scientists to provide their views on probabilistic
hazard estimation.
Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning April 20, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External Affairs,
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, suite 910, Arlington, Virginia 22209; (703) 235-4473.

<DOCTITLE>Panel on the Environment & Public Health Plans Field Trip and Workshop on Yucca Mountain Terrestrial Ecosystems</DOCTITLE>




Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Panel on the Environment & Public Health has scheduled a field
trip to Yucca Mountain followed by a one-day workshop in Las Vegas on March 21 and 22, 1994. A site at Yucca Mountain,
Nevada, is being characterized by the Department of Energy (DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a
permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. Both the field trip and the workshop will
focus on the terrestrial ecosystem studies being conducted in conjunction with the Yucca Mountain project. Although
the field trip and the meeting are open to the public, the number of participants who can attend the field trip will be
limited, and advance reservations will be necessary. (See information below on making advance reservations.) The
workshop will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 4255 South Paradise, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109; telephone (702)
369-4400; fax (702) 369-3770.

The field trip on March 21 will allow panel members and consultants to review the work described to the panel by the DOE
at the panel's November 22, 1993, meeting in Las Vegas. The panel will visit locations where environmental monitoring
activities are being conducted, as well as other locations where scientific studies are under way at the site that
could help project the long-term environmental effects of a potential repository. These might include sites where
infiltration and evapotranspiration are being studied, and places where there is evidence of fracture-rooting
of plants. No cameras or videorecorders are allowed on the field trip. A box lunch will be provided.

Persons wishing to attend the field trip must submit the following information by telephone or fax to Frank Randall
at the Board's offices in Arlington, Virginia; telephone (703) 235-4473; fax (703) 235-4495.

Non-U.S. Citizens: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, gender,
country of citizenship, passport number and expiration date, immigrant alien status, type of visa and expiration
date, name and address of employer, name and address of work place (if different from employer's), length of time in
the United States, and alien registration number. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when
beginning the field trip. Please indicate what type you will bring, the ID number, and the state where it was issued.
This information must be provided to the Board 

no later than February 17, 1994.

 You also must bring your passport or alien registration card with you to the badging office when you begin the field
trip.


U.S. Citizens: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, place of birth, date of birth,
and your business name and address. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when beginning the
field trip. Please indicate what type you will bring, the ID number, and the state where it was issued. All information
must be provided to the Board 

no later than March 4, 1994.

The workshop, which will begin at 8:30 a.m. on March 22, will continue the panel's review of the DOE's environmental
activities at Yucca Mountain, focusing particularly on the potential long-term interactions between a possible
repository and the overlying and surrounding environment. The workshop also will explore a previously stated Board
concern that experimental studies might be needed to develop the information necessary to adequately forecast the
long-term environmental effects of a repository.

Panel members will hear presentations from representatives of the DOE and its contractors on the Thermal-Loading
Study Design, evapotranspiration, and heat transfer from a potential repository to the surface environment. The
panel also will investigate the legal requirements for environmental programs at Yucca Mountain, and the implications
of those legal requirements for the technical studies to be conducted.

Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning May 4, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External Affairs,

Resolution Trust Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The public is hereby notified that the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) maintains a program under which only employees
designated by the RTC as ``Legal Officers,'' who are issued a warrant, execute contracts for legal services on behalf
of the RTC. A Statement of Qualifications to be, and Authority of, an RTC Warranted Legal Officer (Statement), is available
for distribution to the public.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (RTCCA), Public Law No. 93-204, was enacted on December 17,
1993. Section 30 of the RTCCA added a new subsection (y) to section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1441a.
Section 30 of the RTCCA provides that a person may execute or modify a contract for goods or services on behalf of the
RTC only if the person is a warranted contracting officer appointed by the RTC or a managing agent of a savings association
under the conservatorship of the RTC. Section 30 further provides that each such person must provide appropriate
certification to parties contracting with the RTC, and that each contract must contain certain notices to the other
contracting party regarding the requirements for appointment as a warranted contracting officer and the nature
and extent of the warranted contracting officer's or managing agent's authority. Finally, section 30 provides that
any contract that fails to meet these requirements shall be null and void and shall not be enforced against the RTC or
its agents by any court.




In compliance with the RTCCA, the Office of General Counsel of the RTC (also referred to as the Division of Legal Services),
has developed a program for warranting employees of the Office, to be referred to herein as ``Legal Officers,'' to
execute contracts for legal services, and take related actions, on behalf of the RTC. The requirements to be a warranted
Legal Officer, and the nature and extent of the contracting authority exercised by any warranted Legal Officer, are
set forth in the publicly available Statement. These may be adjusted from time to time, with corresponding updating
of the Statement and notice to the public.

There are five levels of Legal Officer, Level V being the highest. In brief summary, the requirements to be appointed
as, and to remain, a Legal Officer are a combination of experience, training, and education. The higher the level,
the more stringent the requirements, and concomitantly, the greater authority exercised.

The amounts of authority granted to each level of Legal Officer are as follows:



Level I:

 On a per contracting action basis, to:

a. Execute contracts with total estimated fees up to $10,000;

b. Execute task orders with total fees up to $25,000 under pre-established task order agreements;

c. Execute contract administrative changes within the scope of a contract which do not affect delivery, cost, or schedule.



Level II:

 On a per contracting action basis, to:

a. Execute contracts with total estimated fees (including options) up to $100,000;

b. Execute individual task orders with total estimated fees up to $200,000 under pre-established task order agreements;

c. Execute administrative changes to contracts, task order agreements, task orders, and contract modifications
including changes in delivery, cost, and schedule, where the fees for the change or modification result in the modified
contract not exceeding $100,000;

d. Execute contract terminations with total fees up to $100,000;

e. Execute contract claim settlements with total fees up to $10,000.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing of Options on American Depositary
Receipts



January 31, 1994.



I. Introduction



On October 12, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market.






The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33103 (October 25, 1993),
58 FR 58357 (November 1, 1993). No comments were received on the proposed rule change.






II. Description



On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved an Amex proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign
security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the
Exchange's established uniform options listing standards.
 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the Amex
must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary
markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing
without an agreement. Second, the Amex's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed
options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000
over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing
under the Amex rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float''
of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and
a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR
Approval Order requires the Amex to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure
that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements.






Furthermore, the Amex options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered
and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association
and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other
applicable requirements of the Act.

The current proposal would authorize the Amex to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage
of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options
to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the
options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the Amex and the primary exchange
on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade.
 





The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the Amex will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in
the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.
 Under the proposal, the Amex will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's
common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) The combined trading volume for
all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of
these classes of stock.
 The above-noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market falls below
30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.








The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket
Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.

III. Discussion



The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a
better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities.
 Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs,
by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets.
 In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect
to options on common stock.









The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the Amex to list and trade options on ADRs given that these
options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, Amex rules require
that the ADRs underlying these options meet the Amex's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described
above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that
the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible
to manipulation.

Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the Amex made a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's
options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying
an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet
these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could
represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange
listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the Amex
standard. The Commission believes, however, that requiring the Amex to review the foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along
with other market safeguards will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can be
potentially manipulated.






Third, the Amex has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information
necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although
the proposal does not require the Amex to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign
exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair
the ability of the Amex to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that 50% or more of the trading
activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes the proposal requires
the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide
for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective
underlying ADR market.

As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively
permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading
the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses.
In particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation
because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if
it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign
securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information
from foreign jurisdictions.
In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary
market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security
underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of
trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that
having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades
and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the
marketplace.
 The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among
other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component
of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.




Under the current proposal, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options on an ADR
without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the underlying
security traded, as long as the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for the underlying
foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued trading
of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not fall below
30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options on ADRs
is the U.S. ADR market rather than the foreign market where the security underlying the ADR trades.
Moreoever, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S.
ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price
discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the Amex has represented that
it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security,
and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security.
 To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires
the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market,
to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all ADRs that
overlie any of these classes.






In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume
for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities
occurs in the U.S. ADR market,
 the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities (i.e.

, stocks and ADRs) underlying the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the
instrumental market for purposes of deterring and detecting potential manipulation or other abusive trading strategies
in conjunction with transactions in the overlying ADR options market. Therefore, because the Amex, and all the other
U.S. self-regulatory agencies which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that
there is an effective surveillance sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate
any potential manipulations of the ADR options or their underlying securities.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies how the Amex will determine whether or not less than 50% (or less than 30%, in the case
of the maintenance standard) of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security (as represented
by ADRs, common stock and any other related securities) occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission believes that
this amendment strengthens the proposal by ensuring that the standard will be applied consistently by all the markets
seeking to list ADR options and raises no new issues.

Accordingly, because the Commission believes that the amendment makes clarifying, non-substantive changes to
the proposal, the Commission finds that it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act
 to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Amex's proposal on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving, and Notice of Filing and
Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to, a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing of
Options on American Depositary Receipts </DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.



I. Introduction



On September 21, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market.






The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33102 (October 25, 1993),
58 FR 58356 (November 1, 1993). No comments were received on the proposed rule change.






II. Description



On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a CBOE proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign
security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the
Exchange's established uniform options listing standards.
 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the CBOE
must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary
markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options, listing
without an agreement. Second, the CBOE's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed
options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000
over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing
under the CBOE rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float''
of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and
a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR
Approval Order requires the CBOE to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure
that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements.





Furthermore, the CBOE options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered
and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association
and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other
applicable requirements of the Act.

The current proposal would authorize the CBOE to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage
of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options
to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the
options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the CBOE and the primary exchange
on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade.

The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the CBOE will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in
the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.
 Under the proposal, the CBOE will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's
common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for
all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of
these classes of stock.
 The above noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market falls below 30%
of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.









The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket
Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.









III. Discussion



The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a
better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities.
 Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs,
by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets.
 In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect
to options on common stock.

The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the CBOE to list and trade options on ADRs given that these
options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, CBOE rules require
that the ADRs underlying these options meet the CBOE's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described
above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that
the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible
to manipulation.

Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the CBOE make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's
options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying
an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet
these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could
represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange
listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the CBOE
standard. The Commission believes, however, however, that requiring the CBOE to review the foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along
with other market safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can
be potentially manipulated.






Third, the CBOE has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information
necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although
the proposal does not require the CBOE to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign
exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair
the ability of the CBOE to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that 50% or more of the trading
activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes the proposal requires
the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide
for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective
underlying ADR market.






As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively
permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading
the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses.
In Particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation
because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if
it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign
securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information
from foreign jurisdictions.

In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary
market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security
underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of
trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that
having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades
and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the
marketplace.
 The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among
other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component
of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.

Under the current proposal, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options
on an ADR without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the
underlying security trades, as long as the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for

In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume
for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities
occurs in the U.S. ADR market,
 the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities (i.e.,

 stocks and ADRs) underlying the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the

U.S. self-regulatory agencies which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that
there is an effective surveillance sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate
any potential manipulations of the ADR options or their underlying securities.





The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. First, Amendment No. 1 deletes, from the proposal, a sentence that defines an ``effective surveillance sharing
agreement'' as an agreement that meets the standards for effectiveness established by the Commission. The Commission
believes that this definition has little substantive effect on the proposal and could create confusion in light of
the fact that the Division classifies surveillance sharing agreements as either comprehensive or market information
agreements.

Second, Amendment No. 2 merely clarifies how the CBOE will determine whether not less than 50% (or less than 30%, in
the case of the maintenance standard) of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security (as represented
by ADRs, common stock and any other related securities) occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission believes that
this amendment strengthens the proposal by ensuring that the standard will be applied consistently by all the markets
seeking to list ADR options and raises no new issues.

Accordingly, because the Commission believes that the amendments make clarifying, non-substantive changes to
the proposal, the Commission finds that it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act
 to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Temporary
Approval on an Accelerated Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Concerning the Institutional Participant Services Program</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on January 6, 1994, the Midwest Securities and Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments
from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through
January 31, 1995.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change extends the temporary approval of (i) the Institutional Participant Services Program (``Program'')
and (ii) the Institutional Participant (``Institutions'') category of participants.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Commission has approved the Program on a temporary basis through January 31, 1994.
 The rationale for initially approving the rule change on a temporary basis was to provide MSTC with the opportunity
to formulate more definitive financial and operational standards for Institutions that desire to participate in
the Program. On December 26, 1990, MSTC filed a proposed rule change
 which proposed more definitive standards and which requested permanent approval of the Program.
 In order to provide the Commission and MSTC with the opportunity to continue their studies of these standards while
providing continuity of service to Institutions participating in the Program, MSTC requests that the Commission
grant temporary approval of this proposed rule change on an accelerated basis under the terms of the previous temporary
approval orders through January 31, 1995. MSTC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section
17A of the Act
 because it will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and help perfect
the national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.








B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



MSTC believes that no burdens will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



MSTC has not received any comments from participants on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and, in particular,
with the requirements of section 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act.
 Those sections require that the rules and organizational structure of a clearing agency be designed to promote the
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism for the national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
The Commission believes that MSTC's proposal will help achieve these requirements by providing Institutions with
the opportunity to participate directly in the national market system through MSTC's Program.





MSTC has requested that the Commission approve the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change because
such accelerated approval will permit MSTC to offer continuity of service to Institutions that currently participate
in the Program while providing the Commission and MSTC with additional time to analyze MSTC's proposed standards
of participation and of financial and operational capabilities for Institutions. The Commission does not anticipate
that it will receive any negative comments on the proposed rule change in light of the fact that no comments have been
received on the proposals approved in the temporary approval orders, which were identical in substance to this proposed
rule change. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the Program has operated without incident during the previous
temporary approval periods.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of MSTC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-MSTC-94-01 and should be submitted by February
28, 1994.



It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSTC-94-01) be, and hereby is, approved on an accelerated
basis through January 31, 1995.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment
No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Listing of Options on American Depositary
Receipts</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 28, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NYSE proposes to amend Rules 715 and 716 to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary
Receipts (``ADRs'') where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs
in the U.S. ADR market.

The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a NYSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign
security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the
Exchange's established uniform options listing standards.
 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the NYSE
must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary
markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing
without an agreement. Second, the NYSE's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed
options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000
over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing
under the NYSE rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float''
of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and
a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR
Approval Order requires the NYSE to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure
that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements.





Furthermore, the NYSE options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered
and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association
and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other
applicable requirements of the Act.

The current proposal would authorize the NYSE to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage
of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options
to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the
options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the NYSE and the primary exchange
on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade.






The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the NYSE will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in
the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.
 Under the proposal, the NYSE will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's
common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for
all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of
these classes of stock. The above-noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S.
ADR market falls below 30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.
 






The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket
Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.








The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act,
 in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NYSE believes that the proposed rule change will not impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to section
19(b)(2) of the Act.






The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a
better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities.
 Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs,
by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets.
 In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect
to options on common stock.









The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the NYSE to list and trade options on ADRs given that these
options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, NYSE rules require
that the ADRs underlying these options meet the NYSE's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described
above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that
the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible
to manipulation.

<TEXT>
 

Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the NYSE make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's
options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying
an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet
these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could
represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange
listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the NYSE
standard. The Commission believes, however, that requiring the NYSE to review the foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along
with other market safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can
be potentially manipulated.






Third, the NYSE has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information
necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although
the proposal does not require the NYSE to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign
exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair
the ability of the NYSE to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that 50% or more of the trading
activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes the proposal requires
the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide
for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective
underlying ADR market.






As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively
permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading
the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses.
In particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation
because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if
it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign
securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information
from foreign jurisdictions.

In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary
market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security
underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of
trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that
having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades
and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the
marketplace.
 The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among
other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component
of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.

Under the current proposal, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options
on an ADR without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the
underlying security trades, as long as, the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for
the underlying foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that at least 50% of the world-wide
trading volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE,
the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued
trading of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not
fall below 30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options
on ADRs is the U.S. market rather than the foreign market where the security underlying the ADR trades. 

Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S.
ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price
discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the NYSE has represented that
it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security,
and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security.
 To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires
the combined training volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR
market, to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all
ADRs that overlie any of these classes.







In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume
for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities
occurs in the U.S. ADR market,
 the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities (i.e., stocks and ADRs) underlying
the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the instrumental market for purposes
of deterring and detecting potential manipulation or other abusive trading strategies in conjunction with transactions
in the overlying ADR options market. Therefore, because the NYSE, and all the other U.S. self-regulatory agencies
which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that there is an effective surveillance
sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate any potential manipulations
of the ADR options or their underlying securities. 





The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendments No. 1, to the proposed
rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. 

The NYSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying
foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market is identical to proposals by the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx to provide for the
listing of ADR options that meet this uniform standard.
 The Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals were subject to a full notice and comment period and no comments were received.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission further notes that approving the current proposal, including Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis
will permit the NYSE to compete on an equal basis with the other options exchanges for orders in ADR options. Accordingly,
since the Commission finds that the current proposal involves the exact same issues as the above-noted proposals,
the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act
 to approve the NYSE's proposal on an accelerated basis.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change,
including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies
thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies
of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that
are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission
and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552,
will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW.,
Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of
the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption
above and should be submitted by February 28, 1994.



It is therefore ordered

, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-93-43) is approved, effective February 7, 1994. Accordingly,
the Exchange may submit listing certificates for ADR options as specified herein on February 7, 1994 pursuant to Rule
12d1-3 under the Act and commence trading in the options according to the time parameters established in the
Joint Options Listing Procedures Plan.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change To Convert
OCC's Index Option Escrow Receipt Program From Pilot to Permanent Status</DOCTITLE>


January 31, 1994.


On May 2, 1989, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-89-04)
under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 to convert OCC's index option escrow receipt program from pilot to permanent status,
 to revise portions of OCC's index option escrow receipt form, and to amend certain OCC rules concerning index option
escrow receipts. The Commission published notice of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

 on June 26, 1989.
 OCC amended the proposal on February 28 and July 3, 1990.
 No public comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal.








I. Description


A. Background


The program permits OCC clearing members to deposit index option escrow receipts with OCC to satisfy the margin requirements
arising from short call positions on index options in their customers' accounts. An OCC-approved custodian bank
that holds an escrow deposit issues an index option escrow receipt to acknowledge that it holds a specific deposit
of assets for the account of a specific customer of an OCC clearing member and to acknowledge that it will not release
the property without OCC's written consent. An index option escrow receipt covers specific index options and obligates
the issuing bank to hold the escrow deposit until OCC releases the escrow receipt or until OCC directs the issuing bank
to make payment on the escrow receipt.


B. The Proposal


The proposal converts the index option escrow receipt program from pilot to permanent status with several amendments.
First, the proposal increases the cap on the value of index option escrow receipts an issuing bank may have outstanding.
The index option escrow receipt currently requires the issuing bank to certify that the value of the cash and securities
held by it pursuant to outstanding index option escrow receipts or the intrinsic value of all options covered by its
outstanding index option escrow receipts does not exceed 25% of the equity attributable to that bank's outstanding
capital stock. The proposal increases that cap from 25% to 100% of the issuing bank's outstanding capital stock.
Second, the proposal alters requirements regarding the type of property acceptable as an escrow deposit. The proposal
eliminates certificates of deposit and banker's acceptances as permissible escrow deposits and adds as a permissible
escrow deposit U.S. government securities having one year or less until maturity.





Third, the proposal gives OCC the authority to close out short option positions of a suspended member covered by index
option escrow receipts and to draw on the proceeds of the escrow receipt to cover costs associated with such closing
transactions.
 OCC may exercise this authority if the value of collateral deposited under the escrow receipt falls below a certain
maintenance level, OCC requests an additional margin deposit to cover the deficit, and OCC suspends the member.





Fourth, the proposal eliminates from the index option escrow receipt a clause requiring issuing banks to certify
that they will not permit customers to subject the escrow deposit to any lien or encumbrance. The proposal adds language
to the escrow receipt which precludes the issuing bank from subjecting the escrow deposit to any right (including
any right of set-off), charge, security interest, lien, or claim of any kind in favor of the issuing bank or any person
claiming through the issuing bank.
Fifth, the proposal revises the index option escrow receipt to permit issuing banks to value escrow deposits at the
end of the day rather than throughout the day in connection with their obligation to request additional customer collateral
or to notify OCC of a collateral deficiency. Currently, an issuing bank must (1) request from the customer a supplemental
escrow deposit if at any time the value of the escrow deposit decreases below 55% of the underlying index option's value
and (2) notify OCC if at any time the value of the escrow deposit decreases below 50% of the underlying index option's
value. Under the proposal, these obligations will not be triggered unless the applicable thresholds are hit at the
close of any business day rather than at any time. Banks have represented to OCC that they are unable to conduct intraday
monitoring of the value of escrow deposits.

<PARENT> FR940207-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the proposal contains several technical amendments to the index option escrow receipt and corresponding
OCC rules. For instance, the index option escrow receipt now specifies that written notification from an issuing
bank to OCC of a collateral deficiency may be by facsimile or other electronic transmission if followed by immediate
telephone confirmation. Throughout Rule 1801, the proposal replaces the term ``market value'' with the term ``value''
when referring to deposited property because the methods for valuing the various types of property eligible for deposit
are described in OCC Rule 1801(f). The proposal also eliminates ``initial position value'' as a definitional term
in Rule 1801(c) because that term is not used elsewhere in OCC Rule 1801. The proposal replaces the term ``agent'' with
the term ``duly authorized representative'' in the index option escrow receipt. The proposal revises the index option
escrow receipt to require issuing banks to include the value of collateral backing index participation escrow receipts
in computing limitations on the amount of escrow receipts they can issue. The revised index option escrow receipt
requires issuing banks to certify that they hold escrow deposits as ``trustee or custodian'' for the account of customers
rather than merely as ``custodian'' and specifies that the issuing banks hold the escrow deposits in accordance with
the terms of the index option escrow receipt rather than in accordance with OCC rules.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular with section 17A(b)(3)(F)
thereunder.
 That section requires, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and to assure the safeguarding of funds and securities in the clearing agency's custody or control or
for which it is responsible.





With regard to OCC's safeguarding obligations under the Act, OCC has implemented procedures designed to diminish
the risks associated with the program. As discussed above and in the Commission order approving the program on a pilot
basis,
 these risk reduction measures include: (1) The requirement that the issuing bank monitor daily the value of escrow
deposits and take appropriate action (

i.e.

, collection of additional collateral and/or notification to OCC) if that value falls below certain thresholds;
 (2) escrow deposit eligibility standards whereby only liquid assets are eligible to underlie escrow receipts; and
(3) OCC's new authority to close out the short positions of a suspended clearing member covered by index option escrow
receipts and to draw on the proceeds of those receipts to cover liquidation costs.






OCC also has rules and procedures governing banks designated by OCC as custodian banks (

i.e., 

banks authorized to issue index option escrow receipts). These controls include: (1) financial standards (

e.g., 

issuing banks must have shareholder equity of not less than $20 million); (2) regulatory standards (

e.g., 

issuing banks must be supervised and examined by state or federal authorities); and (3) depository standards (

e.g., 

issuing banks must file certain financial statements with OCC). Moreover, OCC requires each custodian bank to supply
OCC with a letter from the bank's independent auditors describing the adequacy of the custodian bank's procedures
relating to the issuance of index option escrow receipts.



III. Conclusion



In conclusion, the Commission believes that OCC's index option escrow receipt program should encourage broader
participation in the index options market and is designed to provide adequate safeguards to protect OCC and its clearing
members from financial loss.

On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and, in
particular, with Section 17A of the Act.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-89-04)
be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment
No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing of Options on American
Depositary Receipts</DOCTITLE>


January 31, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 2, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The PSE proposes to amend Rules 3.6 and 3.7 to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary
Receipts (``ADRs'') where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs
in the U.S. ADR market. The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, PSE and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a PSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign
security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the
Exchange's established uniform options listing standards.
 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the PSE
must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary
markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing
without an agreement. Second, the PSE's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed
options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000
over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing
under the PSE rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float''
of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and
a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR
Approval Order requires the PSE to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure
that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements.





Furthermore, the PSE options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered
and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association
and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other
applicable requirements of the Act.

<DOCNO> FR940207-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940207-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The current proposal would authorize the PSE to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage
of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options
to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the
options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the PSE and the primary exchange
on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade.





The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign
securities occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the PSE will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in
the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.
 Under the proposal, the PSE will determine that 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's
common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for
all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of
these classes of stock.
 The above-noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market falls below
30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.








The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket
Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,
 in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The PSE believes that the proposed rule change will not impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.







The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a
better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities.
 Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs,
by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets.
 In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect
to options on common stock.









The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the PSE to list and trade options on ADRs given that these
options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, PSE rules require
that the ADRs underlying these options meet the PSE's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described
above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that
the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible
to manipulation.

Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the PSE make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's
options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying
an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet
these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could
represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange
listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the PSE standard.
The Commission believes however, that requiring the PSE to review the foreign securities underlying the ADR options
to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along with other market
safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can be potentially manipulated.

Third, the PSE has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information necessary
to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although the proposal
does not require the PSE to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign exchange
on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair the ability
of the PSE to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that 50% or more of the trading activity in
the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes the proposal requires the U.S.
self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide for
the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective
underlying ADR market.






As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively
permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading
the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses.
In particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation
because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if
it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign
securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information
from foreign jurisdictions.

In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary
market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security
underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of
trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that
having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades
and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the
marketplace.
 The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among
other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component
of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.





Under the current proposal, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options
on an ADR without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the
underlying security trades, as long as the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for
the underlying foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that 50% or more of the world-wide
trading volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE,
the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued
trading of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not
fall below 30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options
on ADRs is the U.S. ADR market rather than the foreign market where the security underlying the ADR trades.

Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S.
ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price
discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the PSE has represented that
it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security,
and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security.
 To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires
the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market,
to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all ADRs that
overlie any of these classes.







In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume
for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities
occurs in the U.S. ADR market,
 the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities (

i.e.,

 stocks and ADRs) underlying the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the
instrumental market for purposes of deterring and detecting potential manipulation or other abusive trading strategies
in conjunction with transactions in the overlying ADR options market. Therefore, because the PSE, and all the other
U.S. self-regulatory agencies which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that
there is an effective surveillance sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate
any potential manipulations of the ADR options or their underlying securities.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

.



The PSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market is identical to proposals by the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx to provide for the listing
of ADR options that meet this uniform standard.
 The Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals were subject to a full notice and comment period and no comments were received.







The Commission further notes that approving the current proposal, including Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis
will permit the PSE to compete on an equal basis with the other options exchanges for orders in ADR options. Accordingly,
since the Commission finds that the current proposal involves the exact same issues as the above-noted proposals,
the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act
 to approve the PSE's proposal on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving, and Notice of Filing and Order
Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to, a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing of Options on American
Depositary Receipts</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.



I. Introduction



On November 15, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33252 (November 26, 1993),
58 FR 63604 (December 2, 1993). No comments were received on the proposed rule change.







II. Description

 



On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a Phlx proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign
security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the
Exchange's established uniform options listing standards.
 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the Phlx
must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary
markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing
without an agreement. Second, the Phlx's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed
options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000
over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding
three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing
under the Phlx rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float''
of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and
a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR
Approval Order requires the Phlx to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure
that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements.








Furthermore, the Phlx options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered
and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association
and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other
applicable requirements of the Act.

The current proposal would authorize the Phlx to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage
of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options
to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the
options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the Phlx and the primary exchange
on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade.

The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the Phlx will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in
the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.
 Under the proposal, the Phlx will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's
common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for
all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of
these classes of stock.
 The above-noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market falls below
30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.








The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket
Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.

III. Discussion 


The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a
better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities.
 Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs,
by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets.
 In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect
to options on common stock.









The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the Phlx to list and trade options on ADRs given that these
options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, Phlx rules require
that the ADRs underlying these options meet the Phlx's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described
above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that
the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible
to manipulation. 

Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the Phlx make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's
options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying
an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet
these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could
represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange
listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the Phlx
standard. The Commission believes, however, that requiring the Phlx to review the foreign securities underlying
the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along
with other market safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can
be potentially manipulated.
 





Third, the Phlx has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information
necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although
the proposal does not require the Phlx to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign
exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair
the ability of the Phlx to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that the 50% or more of the trading
activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes that proposal requires
the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide
for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective
underlying ADR market.

As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies how the Phlx will determine whether not less than 50% (or less than 30%, in the case
of the maintenance standard) of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security (as represented
by ADRs, common stock and any other related securities) occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission believes that
this amendment strengthens the proposal by ensuring that the standard will be applied consistently by all the markets
seeking to list ADR options and raises no new issues.
Accordingly, because the Commission believes that the amendment makes clarifying, non-substantive changes to
the proposal, the Commission finds that it is consistent with sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act
 to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Amex's proposal on an accelerated basis.




IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that

It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-93-54) is approved, effective February 7, 1994.
Accordingly, the Exchange may submit listing certificates for ADR options as specified herein on February 7, 1994
pursuant to Rule 12d1-3 under the Act and commence trading in the options according to the time parameters established
in the Joint Options Listing Procedures Plan.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 2 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Rule 1047A Regarding Index Option Opening Rotations, Halts and Reopenings</DOCTITLE>


January 31, 1994.


I. Introduction



On June 29, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to make certain amendments to Rule 1047A regarding index option opening rotations, halts,
and reopenings.
 Notice of the proposal, including Amendment No. 1, appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on October 15, 1993.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal.








II. Description of the Proposal



The Phlx has proposed amending Phlx Rule 1047A: (1) To require specialists to open an industry index option for trading
once securities representing 90% of the current value of the index have opened for trading on the primary market; (2)
to permit specialists to open such industry index options once securities representing 50% of the current value of
the index have opened; (3) to permit specialists to halt index option trading, subject to floor official approval,
once securities representing more than 10% of the current value of the index are halted or suspended upon; and (4) to
permit specialists to reopen halted options once securities representing 50% of the market value of an index are opened
or the Exchange determines that the conditions that led to the trading halt are no longer present. Although the text
of Rule 1047A would be reorganized, the following provisions would not be substantively changed: (1) The provision
in Rule 1047A(a) that the Exchange may halt index options trading in the best interests of fair and orderly markets
if certain conditions are met would appear in Rule 1047A(c); (2) Rule 1047A(d) would be renumbered as paragraph (e);
(3) Rule 1047A(c), to be renumbered as paragraph (b) would be retitled as ``Modified Rotations and SORT''; and (4)
the third paragraph of Rule 1047A(a) would contain the provisions formerly in paragraph (b) regarding the procedure
for opening.

In addition, with respect to reorganization, Rule 1047A, currently titled ``Traded Rotations, Halts or Suspensions''
would be retitled ``Trading Rotations, Halts or Reopenings.'' The proposal would also reorganize the paragraphs
to logically follow the procedure of the opening, halting and reopening of trading.



III. Commission Findings and Conclusions



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements
of sections 6(b)(5) in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade as well as to
protect investors and the public interest.

Specifically, the proposal will, under the applicable circumstances, help prevent investors from being exposed
to index options trading based on incomplete pricing data in the underlying securities by setting forth specific
standards for opening and halting trading. For example, in providing that a specialist may open industry index options
for trading when securities representing 50% of the current index value of all securities underlying the particular
industry index have opened for trading on their respective primary market, industry index option market specialists
will have the discretion to determine if adequate pricing information is available in order to ensure that pricing
of industry index options at least substantially reflects the current market value of the traded index's underlying
securities. The proposed requirement that specialists must open their assigned industry index options when 90%
of the current index value of all securities in the index have opened reflects the appropriate determination that
such a level should permit index option pricing that accurately reflects the value of the underlying index components,
upon the index option opening.

The Commission also believes that the Phlx proposal to permit index option specialists to request floor official
approval to halt index options trading where securities representing more than 10% of the index value are halted or
suspended should promote just and equitable principles of trade by allowing the cessation of trading where investors
might lack access to updated pricing information in the component securities of the index. Moreover, the Commission
also believes that the Phlx proposal to adopt a floor procedure advice, paralleling the provisions of Exchange Rule
1047A will help make such procedures readily available to floor members in their advice handbook. 

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Accelerating the amendment will allow the proposal to be enacted without delay. The amendment changes the originally
proposed requirement that index options be automatically halted whenever more than 50% of the current index value
has been halted or suspended from trading on the primary market. The revised requirement will not automatically require
a trading halt under such circumstances, but rather will direct that such a decision be made within the discretion
of the Exchange or one of its floor officials. The Commission believes that this amendment may help provide greater
index option market liquidity under certain market conditions and also provide the Exchange and its floor officials
the flexibility to halt or continue index option trading based upon the circumstances and conditions of the current
market. The Commission also notes that the proposal, including Amendment No. 1 (but excluding Amendment No. 2), was
published for the full 21 day comment period and no comments were received. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-93-30
and should be submitted by February 28, 1994. 



It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-93-30), as amended, is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company et al.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to a Netting Contract and Limited Cross-Guaranty Agreement</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.




On July 8, 1993, and June 2, 1993, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') and the National Securities Clearing Corporation
(``NSCC''), respectively, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes
(File Nos. SR-DTC-93-08 and SR-NSCC-93-07) under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 to establish a Netting Contract and Limited Cross-Guaranty Agreement between DTC and NSCC (``DTC/NSCC Agreement'')
 Notice of the proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 10, 1993.
 No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
changes.






I. Description


A. Netting


Many participants of DTC are also members of NSCC (``common members''), and NSCC itself is a DTC participant. For many
years, DTC and NSCC have provided for a consenting common member's credit balance in DTC's Next-Day Funds Settlement
(``NDFS'') system or a credit balance at NSCC to be applied to its debit balance at the other clearing agency. In practice,
a common member's daily settlement credit at one of the clearing agencies serves to reduce or eliminate any daily settlement
debit of that common member at the other organization.





The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (``FDICIA'') validates netting contracts that
provide for the netting of payment obligations and payment entitlements between and among clearing organizations
and their members.
 Under FDICIA, a payment under a netting contract is not subject to disaffirmance by the receiver or trustee in a subsequent
insolvency proceeding. The netting provisions of FDICIA were designed to reduce systemic risk to the financial markets.




The purpose of the netting provision of the DTC/NSCC Agreement is to establish a netting contract that meets the standards
for FDICIA protection. The netting provision provides that on each common business day that any common member has
a credit balance at one clearing agency and a debit balance at the other, the two balances will be netted, and the following
payments will be made: (1) Each common member with a net debit amount will pay that amount to the clearing agency with
the net debit amount; (2) a clearing agency with a net credit amount with respect to a common member shall pay that amount
to the common member; and (3) for each common member with a credit balance that equals its debit balance, the clearing
agency with the credit balance shall pay that amount to the clearing agency with the debit balance.
The balances covered under the netting provision that will be available to NSCC will be only those in DTC's NDFS system.
DTC will have the right, however, to use a NDFS credit balance to offset an open debit balance in DTC's Same-Day Funds
Settlement (``SDFS'') system before applying the remainder, if any, to a debit balance at NSCC.


B. Limited Guaranty


The DTC/NSCC Agreement also contains a provision limiting the guaranty from each clearing agency to the other clearing
agency that will be invoked when a common member fails. Any resources remaining after a failed common member's obligations
to the guaranteeing clearing agency have been satisfied, including at DTC that common member's SDFS obligations,
will be made available to the other clearing agency. The guaranty is not absolute but rather is limited to the extent
of the resources relative to the failed member remaining at the guaranteeing clearing agency. The principal resources
will be settlement net credit balances, including in certain cases a common member's SDFS net credit balance at DTC,
and the failed member's deposits to the clearing agencies' clearing funds.

<DOCNO> FR940207-2-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940207-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For example, if a common member has a DTC NDFS net debit balance that exceeds its credit balance at NSCC, the operation
of the netting provision will reduce that net debit balance by the amount of the NSCC credit. If that common member then
fails, DTC will apply the member's DTC participants fund deposit to the remaining net debit balance and to any SDFS
net debit balance. If the participants fund deposit is insufficient to satisfy completely all DTC net debit balances,
the limited guaranty provision will enable DTC to look to NSCC to pay any deficiency but only if and to the extent that
the NSCC resources attributable to the common member exceed the common member's obligations to NSCC. Similarly,
NSCC will be able to look to DTC if the common member has a NSCC net debit balance.


There can be situations where a failed common member still owes money either to DTC or to NSCC after netting and after
payment of the guaranty. However, the exposure to DTC's or NSCC's other participants or members will be reduced by
the operation of the DTC/NSCC Agreement.



C. Changes to DTC's and NSCC's Rules




In connection with the implementation of the DTC/NSCC Agreement, DTC is amending its Rules 1, 2, 4, and 9 and NSCC is
amending its Rules 1, 4, 12, and 31. The modifications will incorporate the netting provision into DTC's and NSCC's
Rules so that DTC's participants and NSCC's members become parties to and are bound by the netting provision of the
DTC/NSCC Agreement. The modifications to DTC's and NSCC's Rules also will incorporate the limited guaranty provision
so that a failed common member is obligated to DTC or NSCC to the extent that DTC or NSCC is obligated to the other clearing
agency under the limited guaranty provision.






II. Discussion




Section 17A(a)(2)(A) of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to facilitate the establishment of
linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and settlement of transactions.
 The Commission believes that the DTC/NSCC Agreement is an important step towards achieving such a national system
because the DTC/NSCC Agreement mandates netting of a common member's settlement obligations at each of the clearing
corporations.





Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.
 DTC, NSCC, and their participants and members should gain protection from the netting and guarantee provisions of
the DTC/NSCC Agreement because a common member's credit balance at one clearing agency will be paid to the other clearing
agency, if the common member has a debit balance at that clearing agency, instead of to the common member. This should
reduce the risk that a common member will fail to fulfill its settlement obligation at one clearing corporation but
still collect a credit from the other clearing corporation. If a common member fails, the limited guarantee will be
invoked so that remaining resources attributable to the common member at one clearing agency will be available to
fulfill the common member's obligation at the other clearing agency.





The same section of the Act also requires that a clearing agency's rules be designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the
DTC/NSCC Agreement fosters such cooperation and coordination as evidenced by the risk reduction and payment efficiencies
that should be experienced by DTC, NSCC, and common members upon implementation of the agreement.



III. Conclusion




On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements
of the Act and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.


It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-DTC-93-08 and SR-NSCC-93-97) be,
and hereby are, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organization; The Options Clearing Corporation, et al.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Changes
Relating to Revised Options Exercise Settlement Agreements</DOCTITLE>



January 28, 1994.



On January 27, 1992, October 21, 1991, February 27, 1992, and March 5, 1992, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''),
the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''), the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'')
and the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC''), respectively, filed proposed rule changes

1

 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').

2

 The self-regulatory organizations filed several amendments to the original filings.

3

 The proposed rule changes and amendments implement revised options exercise settlement agreements among OCC, NSCC,
SCCP, and MCC (hereinafter referred to as the ``correspondent clearing corporations'' or ``CCCs''). The Commission
published notice of these proposed rule changes in the 

Federal Register

 on October 14, 1993.
 No comments have been received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule changes.








I. Description



The proposed rule changes will permit the correspondent clearing corporations to put into effect amended and restated
agreements providing for the settlement of exercises and assignments of equity options. In addition, OCC's proposed
rule change makes related changes to OCC's By-Laws, Rules, and certain form agreements used by OCC's clearing members.

In the original filings, OCC, NSCC, SCCP, and MCC proposed to make effective Amended and Restated Options Exercise
Settlement Agreements (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``First Restated Agreements''). OCC, NSCC,
SCCP, and MCC have amended the First Restated Agreements (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``Second Restated
Agreements'') and will make the three Second Restated Agreements, which are the subjects of this approval order,
effective in place of the three First Restated Agreements.

5

 The Second Restated Agreements replace the options exercise settlement agreements that were previously in effect
between OCC and each CCC (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``Original Agreements''). The MCC and SCCP
Second Restated Agreements are substantially identical in form. The NSCC Second Restated Agreement is substantially
in the same form with variations reflecting that NSCC will provide OCC with a daily report identifying all securities
which are eligible for settlement through NSCC's continuous net settlement (``CNS'') system.





A. The Original Agreements and the Changes Made by the Second Restated Agreements



(1) Operation and Continuing Use of Broker-to-Broker Settlement Procedures



Prior to implementing the Original Agreements, exercises of equity options were settled broker-to-broker. In broker-to-broker
settlement, upon receipt of an equity option exercise notice, OCC would issue a delivery advice to the delivering
clearing member (

i.e., 

the assigned clearing member in the case of a call or the exercising clearing member in the case of a put) and to the receiving
clearing member (

i.e., 

the exercising clearing member in the case of a call or the assigned clearing member in the case of a put). The delivery
advice would instruct the delivering clearing member to make delivery of the security underlying the exercised option
directly to the receiving clearing member and would specify the address at which delivery was to be made and the exercise
settlement amount to be paid. OCC continues to have rules governing broker-to-broker settlement.

6

 However, broker-to-broker settlement has been largely replaced by settlement through the facilities of the CCCs.
The Second Restated Agreements provide that OCC will use broker-to-broker settlement only for exercises and assignments
of equity options overlying securities which are not eligible for settlement in NSCC's continuous net settlement
system (``CNS Securities'').

<TEXT>
 

(2) Operation of the Original Options Exercise Settlement Agreements




After OCC entered into the Original Agreements with the CCCs, OCC began to settle the great majority of equity option
exercises through the facilities of the CCCs.
 Each clearing member was required to designate a CCC as its designated clearing corporation (``DCC'') for purposes
of effecting settlements of exercises of equity options. Rather than delivering an underlying security broker-to-broker,
in the revised system a delivering clearing member delivers the security to and receives payment of the exercise settlement
amount from its DCC. A receiving clearing member makes payment to and receives the security from its DCC. If the delivering
clearing member and the receiving clearing member have designated the same CCC as their DCCs, all deliveries and receipts
of securities and all payments and receipts of settlement monies will take place at that DCC in accordance with its
settlement procedures. If the delivering clearing member and receiving clearing member have designated different
CCCs as their respective DCCs, the DCC for the delivering clearing member delivers the security to and receives payment
from the DCC for the receiving clearing member in accordance with the interface arrangements between the two DCCs.







The Original Agreements provide for a five-day settlement period for settlement of exercises of equity options.
The date of the exercise and the settlement period are analogous to the trade date (``T'') and settlement period for
ordinary, regular-way stock trades. OCC reports the exercises and assignments of clearing members to their respective
DCCs during the night of T. The DCCs effect settlement on the fifth business day after T (``T+5'').







B. Changes Made by the Second Restated Agreements




The Second Restated Agreements alter and supplement the provisions of the Original Agreements in several ways. The
most important modifications are set forth below.



(1) Timing of the Effectiveness of the Guarantees of the Correspondent Clearing Corporations




Section 4 of each Original Agreement provides that if the CCC does not notify OCC prior to 12 Noon Central Time (1 p.m.
Eastern Time) on T+4 that the CCC has ceased to act for an OCC clearing member which had designated the CCC as its DCC,
the CCC is unconditionally obligated as of that time to complete the settlement of the exercise. These provisions
were in accordance with the provisions of the rules of the CCCs as in effect in 1976. However, each CCC has subsequently
amended its rules to provide that the CCC will be unconditionally obligated to complete settlement of any ``locked-in''
trade
 in any security eligible for settlement through the CCC's continuous net settlement system. The CCC's guarantees
commence at midnight, or in the case of MCC at 11:59 p.m., of the day the trade is reported to the CCC's participants,
which is usually T+1.







Section 4(a) of each Second Restated Agreement provides that the CCC will become unconditionally obligated to effect
settlement or to close out each exercise and assignment of equity options overlying CNS Securities commencing at
the time specified by the CCC 's rules applicable to locked-in trades in securities eligible for settlement through
the CCC's continuous net settlement system. This revised provision has the effect of causing options exercises and
assignments reported by OCC to the CCCs during the night of T to become guaranteed as of the time at which the CCCs generally
become obligated to effect settlement (i.e., usually midnight at the end of T+1.
 OCC Rule 913 is amended to state expressly that OCC's direct guarantee to the clearing member acting on behalf of the
holder of the option terminates at the time that the clearing member's DCC becomes unconditionally obligated to effect
settlement of the transaction.

(2) Guarantee by OCC to Each Correspondent Clearing Corporation



Each Second Restated Agreement provides that OCC will compensate the CCC for losses incurred by it in closing out the
exercises and assignments of a defaulting participating member.
 The amount of the compensation will be the smallest of the ``net options loss,'' the ``net overall loss,'' or the ``maximum
guarantee amount.'' The net options loss is essentially the actual net loss incurred by the CCC in closing out exercises
and assignments of options to which the CCC is unconditionally obligated at the time of the default. The net overall
loss is essentially the actual net loss incurred by the CCC in closing out all transactions of the defaulting participating
member to which the CCC is unconditionally obligated at the time of the default. The maximum guarantee amount is essentially
the sum of the mark-to-market amounts,
 positive and negative, for all options exercises and assignments to which the CCC is unconditionally obligated at
the time of the default.








OCC's guarantee in each Second Restated Agreement does not cover the exposure of the CCC to losses from exercise and
assignment settlements that can result if a participating member transfers settlements from its account at the CCC
to the account of any other member of the CCC, including another participating member or another member that is an affiliate
of the participating member, and the transferee member defaults on its obligations to the CCC with respect to those
settlements. This occurs for several reasons. First, OCC will not be a party to the transfer and accordingly will not
have the ability to review the impact of the transfer on the financial condition of the transfree member. Second, the
three prongs of the computation of OCC's guarantee obligation are all premised on the assumption that the negative
values arising from short positions of a participating member may be offset against the positive values arising from
the long positions of the participating member. This assumption may not hold true if, for example, a participating
member transfers its short positions but not its offsetting long positions to the account of another member and that
member fails to make settlement. 



(3) Permissible Arrangements for Effecting Settlement through a Correspondent Clearing Corporation



Each Original Agreement contemplated that settlements of exercises and assignments would be effected by entities
that are OCC clearing members and also are participants in a CCC. Each Second Restated Agreement retains the basic
settlement concept contemplated in the Original Agreement and also contains expanded provisions addressing the
alternative settlement arrangement, which are described later in this order. 

(i) Revised agreements for appointing clearing members and appointed clearing members. Each Second Restated Agreement
contains provisions addressing the alternative settlement arrangement that is currently described in OCC's Rules
in which an OCC clearing member appoints another OCC clearing member to effect settlement on its behalf at the appointed
clearing member's DCC. In connection with implementing the Second Restated Agreements, OCC is revising the form
of agreement that OCC requires from each OCC clearing member that appoints another OCC clearing member that is also
a participant in a CCC to act for it for purposes of settling exercises and assignments of equity options. The most important
purpose of the revisions is to cause the appointing clearing member to acknowledge that its obligations to OCC with
respect to settlements of exercises and assignments are not satisfied until its appointed clearing member has satisfied
its obligations to the DCC arising from the exercises and assignments and, accordingly, that the uses that OCC may
make of the appointing clearing member's margin deposits and other assets include satisfying any obligation to the
DCC incurred by OCC as a result of the DCC's settlement of the appointing clearing member's exercises and assignments.

<TEXT>
 

(ii)

 New agreement for Canadian clearing members that settle through CDS. 

The Original Agreement between OCC and NSCC was amended in 1987 to include Canadian clearing members.
 In connection with implementing the Second Restated Agreements, OCC will require each Canadian clearing member
that settles through the Canadian Depository for Securities (``CDS'') to execute a new agreement. The primary purpose
of the new agreement is to cause each such Canadian clearing member to acknowledge expressly that the obligations
of the Canadian clearing member to OCC with respect to settlement of exercises and assignments are not satisfied until
CDS has satisfied its obligations to the DCC of the Canadian clearing member arising from the exercises and assignments
and, accordingly, that the uses that OCC may make of the Canadian clearing member's margin deposits and other assets
include satisfying any obligation to the DCC incurred by OCC as a result of the DCC's settlement of the Canadian clearing
member's exercises and assignments through CDS. The agreement also causes the Canadian clearing member to acknowledge
that it will be deemed not to have designated a DCC for purposes of OCC's rules if CDS at any time should cease to be a participant
in good standing of a CCC. The new agreement is designed to make the Canadian clearing member alternative settlement
arrangement and related agreement as parallel as possible in form and in content to the appointing clearing member
and the nominating clearing member alternative settlement arrangements and their related agreements.







(iii)

 New agreement for nominating clearing members and nominated correspondents.

 Each Second Restated Agreement contains provisions addressing a new alternative settlement arrangement under
which an OCC clearing member nominates an entity that is not an OCC clearing member but that is a participant in a CCC
to effect settlement on its behalf. The need to accommodate the nominating clearing member alternative settlement
arrangement came to OCC's attention as a result of a review of the records of OCC and NSCC relating to settlements of
options exercises and assignments. In the course of that review, it was determined that NSCC's procedures will permit
an NSCC participant that is not an OCC clearing member but that is affiliated with two OCC clearing members, neither
of which is an NSCC participant, to effect settlement of options exercises and assignments on behalf of the two OCC
clearing members. After considering such an arrangement, OCC has determined that it does not create any unusual risk
for OCC or for the system for settling options exercises and assignments. OCC also has determined that such an arrangement
will not involve any additional risk to OCC or to the system even if the entities involved are not affiliated. Accordingly,
OCC has concluded that such arrangements should be expressly described in and permitted by its By-Laws and Rules.

The new agreement to be used for this settlement alternative requires the nominating clearing member (

i.e., 

an OCC clearing member) to not only appoint its nominated correspondent (

i.e., 

a participant in a CCC that is not an OCC clearing member) but also to designate the CCC through which its settlements
are to be made.
 The nominating clearing member does not have to be a participant of the CCC which it designates as its DCC but the nominated
correspondent must be a participant in good standing of the CCC designated as the DCC. The new agreement also requires
that the DCC of the nominating clearing member acknowledge the appointment of the nominated correspondent. This
additional acknowledgement is appropriate because OCC will report exercises and assignments of each nominating
clearing member to the DCC using the OCC clearing member number of the nominating clearing member.
 Therefore, OCC needs to be assured by the DCC that the DCC is aware of the appointment of the nominated correspondent
and is prepared to recognize that settlements reported to it under the OCC clearing member number of the nominating
clearing member are to be processed for the account of the nominated correspondent. In addition, the nominating clearing
member is deemed to be the delivering or receiving clearing member, as the case may be, for purposes of OCC Rule 913,
and accordingly, it is the recipient of delivery advices made available by OCC.

<TEXT>
 

In the nominated correspondent settlement arrangement, OCC will collect margin throughout the settlement period
from the nominating clearing member. In the event that a nominated correspondent were to default on its obligations
to the DCC, OCC will use the margin deposits and other assets of the nominating clearing member to satisfy any resulting
obligation to the DCC incurred by OCC in accordance with the applicable Second Restated Agreement.


(4) OCC By-Laws and Rule Amendments


In connection with implementing the Second Restated Agreements, OCC is making various changes, many of which are
technical in nature, to its By-Laws and Rules.
 NSCC, MCC, and SCCP have determined that no changes to their By-Laws and Rules are required to implement the Second
Restated Agreements.




II. Discussion


Settlement of equity option assignments and exercises through the facilities of the CCCs expose the CCCs to additional
elements of risk. If a participating member that was assigned an option exercise defaults and the CCC's guarantee
has attached, the CCC likely will have to liquidate the failed participating member's position at a price that is less
favorable than the current market price for the underlying security.
 In addition, the earlier guarantee of settlement of exercises and assignments of equity options by the CCCs (

i.e., 

from T+4 to T+1) may pose increased risk to the CCCs.




To limit the CCC's exposure to such risk, the Second Restated Agreements provide that OCC will compensate the CCCs
for losses incurred by them in closing out the exercises and assignments of a defaulting participating member.
 OCC has taken steps to ensure that it is protected from loss and to ensure that it will have adequate resources in the
event it must compensate a CCC for losses. Among other measures, OCC will continue to collect margin throughout the
settlement period. OCC is making amendments to its By-Laws and Rules so that it has the authority to use the margin of
a defaulting participating member to compensate a CCC and the authority to hold a clearing member's margin deposits
for an extra day if OCC receives notice from the clearing member's DCC that the clearing member or its appointed clearing
member, its nominated correspondent, or CDS, in the case of a Canadian clearing member, had not performed an obligation
to the DCC.
 OCC's Rules regarding margin requirements also are being amended to ensure that OCC does not give any margin credit
which arises from positions which will be controlled by a CCC and which OCC might not be able to recover in the event that
it suspends a clearing member.







OCC's By-Laws and Rules also are being amended to provide that OCC may apply the clearing fund deposit of a failed clearing
member to satisfy any obligation incurred by OCC to a CCC as a result of OCC's guarantee.
 In addition, OCC rules make it clear that a clearing member has a continuing obligation to reimburse OCC for any guarantee
payments made to a CCC and that OCC may satisfy this obligation out of the clearing member's assets that are subject
to OCC's lien.
 OCC also has the authority to use the funds of a suspended clearing member that are subject to OCC's control to satisfy
the suspended clearing member's obligation to OCC as a result of a guarantee payment to a CCC.

Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F)
 under the Act require that each registered clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. The
Commission believes that the proposed rule changes and the steps being taken by OCC and the CCCs to implement them,
as described above, are consistent with these sections and will better enable OCC and the CCCs to fulfill their safeguarding
obligations under the Act.




In Section 17A(a)(2)(A) of the Act, Congress directed the Commission to use its authority under the Act to facilitate
the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions
and to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities for the clearance and settlement of transactions
in securities and securities options.
 The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes implementing the Second Restated Agreements are consistent
with these directives. The proposed rule changes and the Second Restated Agreements provide for the efficient settlement
of equity options exercises through the facilities of the equity clearing corporations, without increasing the
risks to those clearing corporations or OCC. Coordination of this settlement activity will enable clearing members
to avoid the duplicative margining of equity options exercises that occurs today. In addition, the rule changes and
the Second Restated Agreements provide for several alternative settlement arrangements (

i.e.

, the appointing, Canadian, and nominating clearing arrangements) for effecting settlement through the CCCs for
firms that are not joint members of OCC and either NSCC, MCC, or SCCP. These alternative settlement arrangements will
allow more firms to take advantage of the uniform and efficient procedures provided for by the settlement of options
through the automated clearance and settlement facilities of the CCCs instead of through broker-to-broker settlement
procedures. Participants also will continue to receive the benefit of a guarantee of settlement on T+1 which will
reduce the risk of a contraparty default and will provide early assurance of settlement.




III. Conclusion


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the Act and in
particular with Section 17A thereunder.
It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-OCC-92-05;
SR-NSCC-91-07; SR-SCCP-92-01; and SR-MCC-92-02) be, and hereby
are, approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change to Revise
PCC's Rules and to Adopt a Participant Agreement and a Clearing Fund Agreement</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.



On September 1, 1992, Pacific Clearing Corporation (``PCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 a proposed rule change (File No. SR-PCC-92-1) to revise PCC's rules and to adopt a Participant Agreement
and a Clearing Fund Agreement. On December 12, 1992, PCC filed an amendment to the proposal.
 The Commission published notice of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

 on May 3, 1993.
 No written comments were received. On September 27, 1993, PCC filed an amendment that did not require republication
of notice.
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal.








I. Description



In 1987, PCC transferred most of its clearing and depository functions to the National Securities Clearing Corporation
(``NSCC'') and The Depository Trust Company (``DTC''). PCC now performs limited services for specialists of the
Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (``PSE''). These services, which are set forth in PCC's revised rules and in
PCC's Participant Agreement include: (1) Clearing and settlement services for PSE specialists' trades executed
on the PSE directly or through a registered clearing agency or a securities depository; (2) custody services for securities
not eligible for depository services at DTC and receipt and delivery services for securities arising from balance
orders or ex-clearing transactions; (3) processing services with respect to dividends, reorganizations, buy-ins
for or against PSE specialists, and cash and next day trades; and (4) preparation and provision of reports containing
information on trading and related activity at each specialist's post.






PCC currently interfaces with NSCC on behalf of PSE specialists. PCC is a member of NSCC and maintains a clearing account
at NSCC with subaccounts for PSE specialists. PCC subcontracts with NSCC to provide clearing and settlement services
for each PSE specialist organization. NSCC maintains subaccounts with DTC, which serves as the depository for PSE
specialists' positions,
 on behalf of the specialists. Under the subcontract arrangement, PSE transmits compared trade information to NSCC
to allow NSCC to determine specialists' net settlement obligations.
 NSCC then transmits these settlement obligations to PCC. Based on NSCC's final settlement figures, PCC will use funds
received by PCC from specialists or will initiate payments against the specialists' bank accounts to satisfy specialists'
settlement obligations to NSCC, DTC, or another entity as required.








PCC will review the bank balance of each specialist post to determine whether there are sufficient funds in the specialist
firm's account to satisfy the specialist's settlement obligations. If PCC determines that there are insufficient
funds for settlement, PCC either (1) will transfer excess funds between specialist posts in the case of intra-firm
specialist posts or (2) will notify the specialist firm's bank of the shortfall to enable the bank to furnish the settlement
funds pursuant to its loan agreement with the specialist firm. If these procedures do not result in sufficient funds
for settlement, PCC will direct the specialist firm to make up the shortfall.

(A) 

PCC Rules



As a result of the substantial diminution of PCC's operations, PCC revised its rules so they accurately reflect the
actual functions and services PCC performs. As revised, PCC's rules consist of fourteen separate rules detailing
participants' and PCC's rights and obligations with respect to each other.



Rule 1 sets out definitions. Rule 2 discusses membership requirements, including financial responsibility requirements
and operational capacity requirements.
 Rule 3 details the types of services performed by PCC for its participants.
 Rule 4 discusses the procedures by which business operations are transacted between participants and PCC.

(B) Clearing Fund



As described above, PCC interfaces with NSCC on behalf of its participants and guarantees the performance of its participants'
obligations to NSCC. As a result, participants now are required to contribute to a clearing fund established by PCC
to ensure that PCC maintains adequate funds to fulfill its guarantee obligations to NSCC and to cover losses suffered
by PCC or its participants which are incident to PCC's clearance and settlement operations.
 In connection with the contribution requirement, PCC and each of its participants will enter into a Clearing Fund
Agreement
 which sets out PCC's and each participant's rights and obligations with respect to the clearing fund.








If a PCC participant fails to discharge any liability to PCC or to PSE, its clearing fund contribution or a portion thereof
will be applied to discharge the liability.
 If PCC suffers a loss due to a participant's default and that loss exceeds the amount of the participant's contribution
to the clearing fund, PCC may satisfy the remainder out of other participants' contributions to the clearing fund.
Any such loss charged to the clearing fund will be charged pro rata against the required contribution of the nondefaulting
participants. The participants and the Commission will be notified of the amount of and the reason for any charge against
the clearing fund. After pro rata charges are made against participants' required contributions, each participant
must pay immediately upon PCC's demand the difference between the participant's minimum requirement and the actual
amount it has in the clearing fund.





(C) Participant Agreement



The Participant Agreement,
 an agreement between each PSE specialist/specialist firm
 and PCC, sets out the rights and obligations between PCC and each participant with respect to clearance and settlement
activities. Specialists' obligations include, among other things, (1) maintaining the net capital requirements
required by PSE Rules, (2) ensuring the availability of funds for PCC's settlements with NSCC and DTC, (3) reviewing
and verifying all records of their transactions provided by PCC, and (4) acting promptly upon receipt of dividend,
reorganization, and buy-in notices.






II. Discussion



The Commission believes PCC's proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular with section 17A(b)(3)(F) thereunder.
 That section requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed (1) to ensure the safeguarding of securities
and funds in the clearing agency's custody or control or for which it is responsible, (2) to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and (3) to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
securities transactions. The Commission believes that PCC's rules and procedures, which are designed to facilitate
the clearance and settlement at PCC, NSCC, and DTC of PSE specialists' securities transactions and which aid PCC in
acting as an intermediary between its participants and NSCC, are consistent with PCC's requirements under the Act.

<DOCNO> FR940207-2-00159 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

As discussed above, PCC's rules and procedures must be designed to ensure the safekeeping of securities and funds
in PCC's possession or control or for which it is responsible. To achieve this aim, PCC designed certain of its rules,
procedures, and operations in a manner that makes them consistent with those of other registered clearing agencies
and adopted for its own use certain methods of operation and systems which previously have been approved by the Commission.
For instance, PCC is instituting the use of a clearing fund similar to other clearing agencies and will use the same
clearing fund formula that is used by NSCC, a formula which the Commission has acknowledged is consistent with a clearing
agency's safekeeping responsibilities under the Act.
 In addition, because PCC's rules and procedures are designed to be consistent with those of other market participants,
PCC is fostering cooperation and coordination with others engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and is removing impediments to and helping perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt
and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions as required under Section 17A of the Act.






As discussed above, PCC's revised rules and procedures present a more accurate reflection of PCC's current operations
as a clearing agency. The Commission stresses that it is of the utmost importance that clearing agency rules and procedures
be maintained so that they present an accurate reflection of the clearing agency's rights and responsibilities with
regard to its participants. Such administrative maintenance helps to ensure that disputes that may arise between
clearing agencies and their participants are fairly and quickly resolved. Precise written rules and procedures
also eliminate uncertainty in the daily interactions between participants and among participants and the clearing
agency. Should PCC decide to modify its clearance and settlement activities, PCC must file with the Commission a proposed
rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act prior to implementation of any such changes. In addition, PCC,
as a registered clearing agency, is required pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-22 to submit to the Commission
all material it issues to its participants or to other entities with which it has a significant relationship.






III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular
with section 17A thereunder. 

It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PCC-92-1) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Participants Trust Company Relating to Margin
Levels for Collateralized Mortgage Obligations</DOCTITLE>


January 31, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on December 28, 1992, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to allow PTC to establish margin levels on Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
(``CMO security'' or ``CMO'') currently eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC by formula
as follows:

Each time a CMO security initially is deposited at PTC, PTC's management will set the margin level for each tranche
of that CMO security (``CMO tranche'') at a percentage which exceeds the CMO tranche's maximum two-day downward price
volatility, based on a model which assumes: i) A change in prepayment speeds based on a sustained change in interest
rates; and ii) the largest historic two day movement in the yield of the underlying Treasury security.
 Margin on CMO tranches which cannot be modeled by an independent pricing source will be set at 100%.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<TEXT>
 

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change would allow PTC to establish a method for calculating the percentages (

i.e.,

 margin) to be deducted from the market value of CMO securities, as distinguished from GNMA securities, currently
eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Currently, the only CMO securities eligible
for deposit at PTC are VA REMICs.






PTC requires its participants to maintain Net Free Equity of zero or greater in each of their agency, pledgee transfer,
or proprietary accounts in order for transactions to be processed. Net Free Equity represents PTC's calculation
of the amount of excess equity, available in a participant's account, which PTC may borrow against or liquidate in
the event a participant's debit balance is not satisfied at the end of the day. Under Article II, Rule 9 of PTC's Rules,
a certain percentage, as determined by PTC (``Applicable Percentage''), of the market value of securities is included
in the computation of Net Free Equity. Net Free Equity is calculated as the sum of:




(a) The cash balance;

(b) The Applicable Percentage of the market value of securities in the account;

(c) The value of the optional deposits to the Participants Fund which are allocated to that account;

(d) 20% of the mandatory deposits to the Participants Fund for the master account; and

(e) Reserve on gain.




The Applicable Percentage is determined by deducting certain percentages (

i.e.,

 margin) from the market value of securities. By including only a portion of the market value of securities in Net Free
Equity, PTC attempts to limit the risk caused by fluctuations in the market value of these securities. For GNMA securities
(other than construction loan, project loan, and mobile home), margins are set at 5%, which is a rate that exceeds their
largest historic consecutive two-day downward price movement.

Unlike GNMA securities, CMO securities are structured as a series of tranches or classes. Each tranche within a CMO
is a separate security with unique characteristics, such as differing payment schedules and price volatility. In
addition, historical price data, to determine volatility, exists for GNMA securities, whereas historical price
data to determine CMO securities' volatility does not yet exist. For CMO securities, therefore, PTC has developed
a model utilizing the yield on Treasury securities to predict the potential movement of a CMO tranche based on the rise
or fall of interest rates. Under PTC's model, the largest two day movement for CMO tranches which exhibit positive
effective duration was a 35 basis point upward move in the underlying Treasury securities. For CMO tranches which
exhibit negative effective duration, the largest two-day move was a 50 basis point downward move in the underlying
Treasury security. For CMO tranches which cannot be modeled, PTC will set the margin at 100% (

i.e.,

 the Applicable Percentage will be zero). PTC proposes to establish the margin for each CMO tranche based on this method,
rather than assigning a specific percentage for CMO securities, because each CMO security has unique characteristics.
Without historical information, such as that available for GNMA securities, PTC believes the use of an analytical
model is the best method to determine the expected volatility of a CMO tranche. The margin for each CMO tranche will
be set by PTC management, on the basis of the stated analysis and formula, as the CMO tranche is deposited in PTC.

Since the proposed rule change provides for the safeguarding of securities and funds within PTC's custody or control
or for which it is responsible, PTC believes it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to PTC.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



PTC has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. PTC has not received any
unsolicited comments from participants or other interested parties.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:




(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of PTC. All submissions should refer to File Number SR-PTC-92-16
and should be submitted by February 28, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Brock Exploration Corporation,
Common Stock, $.10 Par Value) File No. 1-9461</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.



Brock Exploration Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

The Company has determined to withdraw the listing and registration of the Common Stock on the PSE for the following
reasons:

(a) According to the Company, the Common Stock is listed and registered for trading on the American Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``Amex'') and will continue to be so listed following withdrawal from trading on the PSE;

(b) According to the Company, the transactions in the Common Stock on the PSE are small and infrequent with the majority
of the transactions in the Common Stock now taking place on the Amex; and

(c) According to the Company, it has determined that, in light of the fact that the Common Stock is listed and traded
on the Amex, the benefits from the continued listing of the Common Stock on the PSE do not warrant the additional listing
fees and other expenditures associated with the continued listing on the PSE.

Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

company. The Trust currently offers five separate investment portfolios, none of which have adopted plans of distribution
under rule 12b-1. The Trust offers shares of four of these portfolios to investors at their net asset value plus
a sales charge at the time of purchase. Shares of the other portfolio, a money market portfolio, are offered to investors
at net asset value without a sales charge. The Trust intends to offer shares in four additional portfolios in the near
future, each of which has adopted plans of distribution under rule 12b-1.

4. The Distributor is a partnership owned equally by American Capital Marketing, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
of American Capital Management & Research, Inc. (``ACMR''), and PFS Distributors, Inc., an affiliate of Primerica
Financial. ACMR and PFS Distributors, Inc. are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Travelers Inc. The Distributor,
which is registered as a broker dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, acts as principal underwriter to
the Funds.

5. Applicants propose to establish a multiple pricing system (the ``Multiple Pricing System''), which would provide
investors with three alternative means of purchasing shares in the Funds: (a) With a conventional front-end sales
load and subject to a service fee (``Class A shares''); (b) subject to the CDSC for a specified period of time, a distribution
fee, and a service fee (``Class B shares''), with or without a conversion feature; or (c) either with a front-end sales
load or a net asset value and subject, in either case, to a CDSC for a specified period of time, a distribution fee, and
a service fee (``Class C shares''), with or without a conversion feature.






6. From time to time, the Funds may create additional classes of shares. These additional classes may differ from the
classes specifically described herein only in the following respects: (i) Any such class may be subject to different
rule 12b-1 distribution and service fees; (ii) any such class may bear different identifying designations;
(iii) any such class will have exclusive voting rights with respect to any rule 12b-1 plan adopted exclusively
with respect to such class, except as provided in condition 15; (iv) any such class may have different exchange privileges;
(v) any such class may be subject to incremental transfer agency costs attributable to such class; and (vi) any such
class may or may not have a conversion feature.

7. The distribution structure for all classes of shares of the Funds will comply with any applicable limitations of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') on asset-based sales charges, including rule 12b-1
plan distribution and service fees, which are contained in the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, as they may be amended
or modified from time to time.

8. On a daily basis, the investment income of a Fund will be allocated 

pro rata

 to each class on the basis of the relative net asset value of the respective classes. All expenses incurred by a Fund
not attributable to a specific class will be allocated 

pro rata

 to each class on the basis of the relative net asset value of the respective classes, except for the expenses of the rule
12b-1 plans and incremental transfer agency costs, if any, which will be borne by the class that incurred such
expenses.

9. Investors may purchase Class A shares at their net asset value plus a front-end sales load, which may be reduced for
larger purchases, under a cumulative purchase discount, or under a letter of intent. The sales loads also will be subject
to certain other reductions permitted by rule 22d-1 under the Act and as provided in the registration statement
of the Funds. Class A shares will be subject to a service fee under a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1, based
upon a percentage of the average daily net assets of the Class A shares.

10. Investors may purchase Class B shares at their net asset value per share without the imposition of a sales load at
the time of purchase. Class B shares will be subject to a distribution fee, payable to the Distributor, at an annual
rate of .75% of the average daily net assets of the class, and a service fee at an annual rate of .25% of the average daily
net assets of the class. In addition, an investor's proceeds from a redemption of Class B shares made within a specified
period of purchase (the ``CDSC Period'') (which could be at least three years, but would not exceed eight years) may
be subject to a CDSC, which is paid to the Distributor. The CDSC is expected to range from 3% to 5% (but can be higher or
lower) on shares redeemed during the first year after purchase, and will be reduced at a rate of 1% (but can be higher
or lower) per year over the applicable CDSC Period.

11. Class C shares will be subject to a distribution fee and a service fee at an annual rate of 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively,
of the average daily net assets of the Class C shares pursuant to a rule 12b-1 plan. In addition, an investor's
proceeds from a redemption of Class C shares made within the CDSC Period (expected to be not more than five years) generally
will be subject to a CDSC imposed by the Distributor. The CDSC is expected to be up to 4% (but may be higher or lower) on
shares redeemed during the first year after purchase and will be reduced at a rate of 1% (but can be higher or lower) per
year over the applicable CDSC Period, so that redemptions of shares held after that period will not be subject to a CDSC.

<PARENT> FR940207-2-00077 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


12. No CDSC will be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a fixed number of years prior to their
redemption, or on shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on
an amount that represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation
above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC Period. The amount of the CDSC to be imposed will depend on
the number of years since the investor made the purchase payment from which an amount is being redeemed and the lesser
of the shares' cost or the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption.



13. Applicants also request the ability to waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) Following the death or disability, as
defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b) in connection with
certain distributions, described in the following paragraph, from an individual retirement account, a deferred
compensation plan under the section 457 of the Code, a custodial account maintained pursuant to section 403(b)(7)
of the Code, or a qualified pension or profit sharing plan (collectively, ``Retirement Plans''); (c) pursuant to
a Fund's systematic withdrawal plan, but limited to 12% of the value of the account annually; (d) effective pursuant
to the right of a Fund to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset values of shares held in the account
is less than the designated minimum account size described in the Fund's prospectus; and (e) by the Adviser of its investment
in a Fund. If a Fund waives or reduces the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in
the class specified.



14. The CDSC may be waived for a total or partial redemption in connection with certain redemptions from Retirement
Plans. The CDSC charge may be waived for any redemption in connection with (a) a distribution from a Retirement Plan
after attainment of age 591/2 (or such other age as may be provided in section 72(t)(2)(A)(i) of the Code), (b) in the
case of a tax sheltered custodial account maintained under section 403(b)(7) of the Code or a qualified pension or
profit sharing plan after separation from service after attainment of age 55 (or such other age as may be provided in
section 72(t)(2)(A)(v) of the Code, (c) in the case of an eligible deferred compensation plan established and maintained
pursuant to section 457 of the Code, after separation from service, or (d) a loan, from a qualified employer plan to
a participant, that is intended to meet the requirements of section 72(q)(2) of the Code. In addition, the CDSC may
be waived upon the tax-free rollover or transfer of assets to another Retirement Plan invested in one or more of the
Funds. In such instances, a Fund will tack the period for which the original shares were held on to the holding period
of the shares acquired in the transfer or rollover for purposes of determining what, if any, CDSC is applicable in the
event that such acquired shares are redeemed following the transfer or rollover. The CDSC also may be waived on any
redemption that results from the tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d)(4) or (5) of
the Code, the return of excess deferral amounts pursuant to section 401(k)(8) or 402(g)(2) of the Code, or from the
death or disability of the employee.



15. Class B shares and Class C shares may automatically convert to Class A shares a certain number of years after the
end of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. For Class B shares, the conversion
period will be between four and ten years; for Class C shares, the conversion period will be a maximum of twelve years.
For purposes of conversion to Class A, all shares in a shareholder's account that were purchased through the reinvestment
of dividends and distributions paid in respect of Class B shares or Class C shares will be considered held in a separate
sub-account. Each time any Class B shares or Class C shares in the shareholder's account convert to Class A, an equal
proportion of the Class B shares or Class C shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A.



16. The Trust will have obtained an opinion of counsel that the conversion of Class B shares and Class C shares to Class
A shares does not constitute a taxable event under current federal income tax law. The conversion of Class B shares
and Class C shares to Class A shares may be suspended if such an opinion is no longer available at the time such conversion
is to occur. In that event, no further conversions of Class B shares or Class C shares would occur, and shares might continue
to be subject to the additional distribution fee for an indefinite period.



17. No CDSC will be imposed in connection with the exercise of an exchange privilege whereby an investor exchanges
Class B shares or Class C shares for Class B or Class C shares of another Fund or for shares of the money market portfolio
of the Trust. In the case of the exercise of an exchange privilege between the Funds, a Fund will tack the period for which
the original shares of a class of the Fund were held on to the holding period of the shares acquired in the exchange for
purposes of determining what, if any CDSC is applicable in the event that such acquired shares are redeemed following
the exchange. In the event of redemptions of shares after exchanges, an investor will be subject to the CDSC schedule
imposed by the original Fund. All such exchanges will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act.

Applicants' Legal Conclusions 



1. Applicants are requesting an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number
of classes of shares representing interests in the Funds might be deemed (a) to result in the issuance of a ``senior
security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the Act, and
(b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. 

2. Applicants believe that the proposed Multiple Pricing System does not present the concerns that section 18 of the
Act is intended to redress. The Multiple Pricing System does not involve borrowings and will not affect a Fund's assets
or reserves. The proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Funds, since
all such shares will participate 

pro rata

 in all of each Fund's income and all of each Fund's expenses, with the exception of the differing distribution fees
and incremental agency costs, if any. Moreover, the capital structures of the Funds will not facilitate control without
equity or other investment, nor will they make it difficult for investors to value the securities of the Funds. 

3. Applicants believe that the issuance and sale by the Funds of an unlimited number of classes will better enable the
Funds to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the Multiple Pricing System,
an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial, given the amount of his or
her purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances.
The proposed arrangement would permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of its securities and provide
investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping
costs or unnecessary investment risks. 

4. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b-1
distribution plans is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. With respect to any
Fund, the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially identical, and consequently the possibility
that their interests would ever conflict would be remote. In any event, the interests of the Class A, Class B, and Class
C shareholders with respect to the service fee and/or distribution fee would be adequately protected, since the rule
12b-1 plans for each of those classes will conform to the requirements of rule 12b-1, including the requirement
that their implementation and continuance be approved on an annual basis by both the full board and the disinterested
directors of the Funds. 

5. Applicants believe that the implementation of the CDSC in the manner and under the circumstances described above
would be fair and in the best interests of shareholders of the Funds. Thus, the granting of the order requested herein
would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of the same Fund will
relate solely to (a) class-specific expenses consisting of (i) rule 12b-1 plan distribution and service fees,
(ii) incremental transfer agency costs, and (iii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that
should be properly allocated to one class, which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order, (b) each
class will vote separately as a class with respect to its rule 12b-1 plan, except as provided in condition 15,
(c) any class may have different exchange privileges, (d) each class of shares, other than Class A shares, may have
a conversion feature, and (e) any class may bear different identifying designations.

2. The trustees of the Funds (the ``Trustees''), including a majority of the disinterested Trustees, shall have approved
the Multiple Pricing System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Pricing System by the Funds. The minutes of
the meetings of the Trustees regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary
to implement the Multiple Pricing System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that
the Multiple Pricing System is in the best interests of both the Trust and its respective shareholders.

3. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the various classes of shares.
The Trustees, including a majority of the disinterested Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop.The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their
own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

4. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are
not interested persons of the Trust. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid
or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the Trustee, and the Trustees shall review, at least quarterly,
a written report of the amount so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

5. The Trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution expenditures complying with
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only distribution
expenditures properly attributable to the sale of a particular class of shares will be used to support the distribution
fee and service fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon
which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the disinterested Trustees in the exercise of their
fiduciary duties.

6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner at the same time on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that distribution fee and service
fee payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class, and any incremental
transfer agency costs relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class.

7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''),
who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports,
following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff
upon the written request to the Trust for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management
or of a regional office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief
Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators.
The initial report of the Expert will be a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may
be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Export in the initial
report referred to in condition 7 and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on
an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7. Applicants will take immediate
corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 

9. The prospectus of each Fund that offers multiple classes will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson
and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling Fund shares may receive different compensation
for selling one particular class of shares over another in a Fund. 

10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when a particular class of shares may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such
standards. 

11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
with respect to the Multiple Pricing System will be set forth in guidelines, which will be furnished to the Trustees.


12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in its prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through the prospectus. The shareholder reports will disclose
the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain,
in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to each Fund as a whole
generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with
respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses
or performance data applicable to a particular class of shares, it will also disclose the expenses and/or performance
data applicable to all classes of shares offered by such Fund. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will separately present
each class of shares. 

13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their
rule 12b-1 distribution plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 

14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion. 

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to a rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class
shares unless shareholders of the Purchase Class, voting separately as a class, approve the amendment. The Trustees
shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into
a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior
to implementation of the amendment, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target
Class shares. If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange
of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to such existing Purchase
Class shares in all material respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The
New Target Class and New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions
described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of the New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor.
Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject
to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of
such plan to the Purchase Class are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 

16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, as such rule is currently
proposed, and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>The MainStay Funds, et al.; Application</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').







Applicants: 

The MainStay Funds (the ``Trust'') and NYLIFE Distributors Inc. (the ``Distributor''), on behalf of all existing
and subsequently created series of the Trust and all other registered open-end management investment companies
having the Distributor or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Distributor as principal
underwriter (the ``Funds'').







Relevant Act Sections: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and
rule 22c-1 thereunder.




Summary of Application: 

Applicants seek an order that would amend certain prior orders (the ``Prior Orders'') issued under section 6(c) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 The Prior Orders granted an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c-1
thereunder to permit the imposition or waiver of a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions.
Applicants seek to amend the prior orders to alter the CDSC schedule described in the prior applications, and to add
other instances in which the CDSC can be waived.

Courtney S. Thornton, Senior Attorney, at (202) 272-5287, or C. David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 272-3018
(Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). 



Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 


Applicants' Representations


1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The Trust
is a series company, and currently offers shares of thirteen separate series for sale to investors. 

2. The Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company (``New York Life''), acts as administrator,
principal underwriter, and distributor to all series of the Trust. 

3. The Trust offers shares in nine of its existing series subject to a CDSC. The CDSC is imposed in reliance upon the Prior
Orders, which exempt applicants from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and rule 22c-1
thereunder. Currently, a CDSC of up to 5% is imposed on shares of these series at the time of any redemption by a shareholder
that reduces the value of the shareholder's account in the series to an amount that is lower than the amount of all payments
by the shareholder for the purchase of shares during the preceding six years. Each of these series has adopted a distribution
plan pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. 

4. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Orders to permit the Funds to sell shares subject to a CDSC that may vary from the
rate and schedule contained in the Prior Orders. No increase in the CDSC amount or extension of the applicable period
will apply to shares sold prior to the issuance of an amended order. 
5. The CDSC schedule may vary from Fund to Fund. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased
more than a maximum number of years prior to the exemptions, as indicated in the relevant CDSC schedule (the ``CDSC
Period''), or on shares derived from reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount
that represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the
amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC Period. As a result, the amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the
lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase,
or the amount that represents such percentage of the net value of the shares at the time of redemption. In determining
the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital
appreciation, next of shares representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, and finally
of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time.

6. Applicants also request amendment of the Prior Orders to waive the CDSC for pre-retirement transfers or rollovers
from a Fund to another investment sponsored or distributed by New York Life or its subsidiaries, when both the Fund
and the other investment are funding vehicles for a single retirement plan.

7. As amended, the order would permit applicants to waive the CDSC for redemptions: (a) Following the death or disability,
as defined in section 72 (m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b)
in connection with distributions permitted to be made under the Code from an individual retirement account (``IRA''),
or other retirement and tax-deferred plans; (c) of shares purchased by active or retired officers, directors or trustees,
partners, and employees of the Funds, by the Distributor or affiliated companies, by members of the immediate families
of such persons, and by dealers having a sales agreement with the Distributor, or any trust, pension, or profit sharing
plan for the benefit of such persons; (d) by New York Life or an affiliate thereof; (e) in connection with redemptions
of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (f)
by accounts established with an initial purchase order of $1 million or more; (g) effected by separate accounts or
advisory accounts managed by New York Life or an affiliated company; (h) by tax-exempt employee benefit plans resulting
from the adoption of any law or regulation pursuant to which continuation of the investment in the Funds would be improper;
(i) effected by registered investment companies in connection with the combination of the investment company with
a Fund by merger, acquisition of assets or by any other transaction; (j) by any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality;
department, authority or agency thereof, and by trust companies and bank trust departments that are holding shares
in a fiduciary capacity; (k) made for the purpose of funding a loan to a participant in a tax-qualified retirement plan
permitted to make such loans; (l) on transfers to (i) other funding vehicles sponsored or distributed by New York Life
or an affiliated company, or (ii) guaranteed investment contracts, regardless of sponsor, within a retirement plan;
(m) made to meet required distributions by a charitable remainder trust under section 664 of the Code; and (n) by living
revocable trusts. Applicants believe that these proposed waivers are appropriate because they involve the redemption
of shares sold at little or no selling expense to the Funds or the Distributor.

8. In addition to the CDSC waivers described above, no CDSC will be charged in connection with the exercise of an exchange
privilege whereby an investor exchanges shares of a Fund for shares of another Fund subject to a CDSC. In such a case,
the Fund will add the period for which the shares of the original Fund were held to the holding period of the shares acquired
in the exchange for purposes of determining what, if any, CDSC is applicable in the event that such acquired shares
are redeemed following the exchange. In the event of redemptions of shares after exchanges, as investor will be subject
to the CDSC of the Fund with the longest CDSC period or highest CDSC schedule which may have been owned by him, whichever
results in the greatest payment. All exchanges will be effected in accordance with the provisions of section 11(a)
and rule 11a-3.

9. Applicants also propose to provide a pro-rata credit for and CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares
followed by a reinvestment effected within a set number of days, not to exceed 365, of the redemption. The credit will
be paid for by the Distributor, not by the Funds.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



Applicants believe that the implementation of the CDSC in the manner and under the circumstances described above
would be fair and in the best interests of shareholders of the Funds. Accordingly, applicants believe that the granting
of the order requested herein would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.



Applicants' Condition



Applicants agree that, as a condition of granting the requested relief, they will comply with the provisions of proposed
rule 6c-10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule currently is
proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Matlack Systems, Inc., Common
Stock, $1.00 Par Value; Common Stock Purchase Rights) File No. 1-10105</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.



Matlack Systems, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock and common stock purchase rights
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock and common stock purchase rights
commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 9, 1993 and concurrently therewith such stock
was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not believe that dual trading of its securities on both the NYSE and Amex would be advantageous, but
rather, that such a dual listing might fragment the market for the common stock.

Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

(Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).



Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 


Applicants' Representations


A. The Multi-Class Arrangement


1. North American Funds is a registered open-end diversified management investment company, organized as a Massachusetts
business trust. It currently has the following portfolios. Global Growth Fund, Growth Fund, Growth and Income Fund,
Asset Allocation Fund, Strategic Income Fund, Investment Quality Bond Fund, U.S. Government Securities Fund, National
Municipal Bond Fund, California Municipal Bond Fund, and Money Market Fund (together with the investment portfolios
of the Other Funds, the ``Series''). NASL Financial is a wholly-owned subsidiary of North American Security Life
Insurance Company, a Delaware stock life insurance company. NASL Financial serves as the distributor (the ``Distributor'')
of the Fund's shares and as the investment adviser (the ``Adviser'') to the Fund. 
2. The Series currently offer a single class of shares at net asset value plus, in the case of all Series except the Money
Market Fund, a front-end sales charge. The sales charge is waived for share purchases totalling more than $100,000
and less than $1 million, but such shares are subject to a CDSC.
 Share purchases totalling $1 million or more are not subject to a sales charge or any CDSC. Pursuant to the Fund's rule
12b-1 distribution plan, shares of each Series (except for the Money Market Fund) currently are subject to a
distribution fee of up to 1.00% of their average annual net assets, depending upon the Series. 




3. Applicants propose to offer three classes of shares initially, designated as ``Class A'' shares, ``Class B'' shares,
and ``Class C'' shares. Applicants propose to reclassify the existing class of shares of certain of the Series as Class
A shares and the existing class of shares of certain of the other Series as Class C shares. Each reclassified share will
bear the identical distribution and service fees after such reclassification as it did before the reclassification,
and would not be subject to any increase in such fees or to any new or increased redemption charges as a result of the reclassification.
The Fund in the future may create an unlimited number of classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from the Class
A, Class B, and Class C shares only in accordance with the characteristics described in the application. 
4. Class A shares (except for the Money Market Fund and except as described in the next sentence) will be offered at net
asset value plus a front-end sales load, and will be subject to a maximum distribution fee of up to .10% and a service
fee of up to .25% of their respective average annual net assets. Class A shares of the National Municipal Bond Fund and
the California Municipal Bond Fund will be subject to a service fee of up to .15% of their respective average annual
net assets and will not be subject to any distribution fee. Except with respect to certain shares reclassified as Class
A shares and subject to the Existing CDSC, Class A shares will not be subject to any CDSC arrangement. 
5. Class B shares will be offered for purchases of $250,000 or less. Class B shares will be sold at net asset value, subject
to a CDSC, described below. Class B shares of each Series (except for the Money Market Fund) will be subject to a distribution
fee of up to .75% and a service fee of up to .25% of their average net asset value.
6. Class C shares will be sold at net asset value. Except with respect to certain shares reclassified as Class C shares
and subject to the Existing CDSC, it is anticipated that Class C shares will not be subject to a front end sales load or
CDSC. Class C share of each Series (except for the Money Market Fund) will be subject to a distribution fee of up to .75%
and a service fee of up to .25% of their average net asset value.

7. In the future, the Fund, on behalf of a Series or class thereof, may enter into non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services
agreements (``Shareholder Services Plan'') with certain financial institutions (which may include banks), securities
dealers, and other industry professionals providing for the performance of certain services. In the event that a
Series or class thereof is subject to both a rule 12b-1 distribution plan and a Shareholder Services Plan, services
provided under one plan will augment, rather than duplicate, services provided under the other plan.

8. Each class of a Series will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and will be identical in all
respects except for: (a) The compensation and other arrangements permitted by different distribution plans and
Shareholder Services Plans for each class; (b) voting rights with respect to any matter specifically affecting that
class, including the distribution plan and Shareholder Services Plan for that class and expenses related to the cost
of holding shareholder meetings necessitated by the exclusive voting rights with respect to the distribution plan
of each class (and, if applicable, Shareholder Services Plan), except as provided in condition 16 below; (c) the impact
of any expenses directly attributable to that class, as described in the following paragraph (``Class Expenses'');
(d) any differences in distributions and/or net asset value per share resulting from differences in Class Expenses;
(e) any differences in features for purchasing, redeeming, exchanging, or converting shares of each class and/or
in distribution arrangements for the offer and sale of such shares; and (f) the designation of classes.

9. Class Expenses may include the following: (a) Distribution plan fees (including service fees) or Shareholder
Services Plan fees; (b) transfer and shareholder servicing agent fees and shareholder servicing costs; (c) professional
fees relating solely to a particular class; (d) trustees fees, including independent counsel fees relating solely
to a particular class; (e) printing and postage expenses for materials distributed to shareholders of a particular
class; (f) Blue Sky and SEC registration fees relating solely to a particular class; and (g) shareholder meeting expenses
for meetings of a particular class.

10. Expenses that are attributable to a particular Series but not to a particular class (``Series Expenses'') will
be allocated based on the net assets of each class.

11. Class A shares on which a sales charge has been paid will be exchangeable at net asset value for Class A shares of any
other Series (including the Money Market Fund), but not for Class B or Class C shares. Class B shares will be exchangeable
at net asset value for Class B shares of any other Series (including the Money Market Fund), but not for Class A or Class
C shares. No Class B CDSC will be imposed on shares acquired by exchange where the exchanged shares would not have been
assessed a CDSC upon redemption. Class C shares will be exchangeable at net asset value for Class C shares of any other
Series (including the Money Market Fund), but not for Class A or Class B shares. In the future, applicants may permit
exchanges of shares of any class of a Series for shares of the same class of other open-end investment companies sponsored
by the Adviser or the Distributor that hold themselves out as related companies for purposes of investment and investor
services. Applicants will comply with rule 11a-3 as to any exchanges.

12. All Class B shares, other than those purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, will
automatically convert to Class A shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes six years after
the end of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. All Class C shares, other than
those purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, will automatically convert to Class A
shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes not later than ten years after the end of the calendar
month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. For purposes of calculating the holding period,
Class B (or Class C, as the case may be) shares will be deemed to have been issued on the sooner of the date on which the issuance
of the Class B (or Class C) shares occurred, or for Class B (or Class C) shares obtained through an exchange or series
of exchanges, the date on which the issuance of the original Class B (or Class C) shares occurred. Shares purchased
through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions in respect of Class B (or Class C) shares will be treated
as Class B (or Class C) shares, except that each time any Class B (or Class C) shares in the shareholders account (other
than those purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions) convert to Class A, an equal


pro rata

 portion of the Class B (or Class C) shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions
also will convert to Class A. The portion will be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Class B (or Class C)
shares converting to Class A bears to the shareholder's total Class B (or Class C) shares not acquired through dividends
and distributions. Of the initial classes of shares, only Class B and Class C will have a conversion feature (additional
classes created in the future also may have a conversion feature).

B. The CDSC Arrangement



1. The Fund proposes to implement a CDSC arrangement for Class B shares (the ``Class B CDSC''). If Class B shares are
redeemed within six years after the end of the calendar month in which a purchase order was accepted, a CDSC will be imposed
by applying a specified percentage ranging from 1% to 5% to the lesser of the aggregate net asset value of the shares
at the time of purchase, or the aggregate net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. The existing schedule
may be modified in the future, and other schedules with different percentages and periods may apply to different classes
created in the future. Any variations in the CDSC schedule will be set forth in the applicable prospectus. Any change
in the terms of the CDSC would not affect shares already issued unless the change resulted in terms more favorable to
the holders of such shares.

2. No Class B CDSC will be imposed on (a) redemptions of shares held for more than six years after the end of the calendar
month in which the purchase order was accepted, (b) amounts representing an increase in the value of a shareholder's
account due to increases in the net asset value per share, or (c) shares acquired through reinvestment of income dividends
or capital gains distributions. In determining the rate of any applicable CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption
is made first of shares that are not subject to the Class B CDSC and then of shares held for the longest period of time.
This will result in the CDSC being imposed at the lowest possible rate.

3. Applicants may waive the Class B CDSC in the following instances: (a) Retirement distributions to participants
or beneficiaries from (i) retirement plans qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (``Code''),
(ii) Code section 403(b)(7) plans, (iii) deferred compensation plans under Code section 457, and (iv) other employee
benefit plans, following retirement, termination of employment, as the result of a loan made by a retirement plan
that permits loans, as the result of the hardship of a plan participant (to the extent permitted by the Code), and/or
the attainment of age 591/2 of a plan participant (if such payments are made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan
where the payments do not exceed the then applicable effective maximum free withdrawal amount, annually of the value
of the account); (b) distributions from IRAs prior to and/or following the attainment of age 591/2 (if such payments
are made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan where the payments do not exceed the then effective maximum free
withdrawal amount, annually of the value of the account); (c) redemptions made following the death or disability
(as defined in the Code) of a shareholder; (d) distributions and redemptions made automatically and periodically
pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan where the payments do not exceed the then effective maximum free withdrawal
amount, annually of the value of the account; (e) a tax-free return of excess contributions made to any retirement
plan; (f) the combination of the Fund or any Series of the Fund with any other investment company by merger, acquisition
of assets, or otherwise; and (g) redemptions effected pursuant to the Series' right to liquidate a shareholder's
account if the aggregate net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the then applicable effective minimum
account size. If any of the waiver categories are offered and subsequently discontinued, appropriate disclosure
will be made in the applicable prospectus and investors who purchased their shares prior to such change will continue
to be entitled to such CDSC waivers. In addition, if a Fund waives or reduces a CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be
uniformly applied to all shares in the specified category.

4. A shareholder will be credited with any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of any Class B shares followed by
a reinvestment in Class B shares of such Series or another Series within a time period specified in the current prospectus
of the Fund, currently anticipated to be 90 days after such redemption. The credit will be paid by the Distributor.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the Fund might
be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g), the issuance and sale of which
would be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).

2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Fund to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Fund to facilitate both the distribution of its securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the
method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks. 

3. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b-1
plans (and any Shareholder Services Plans adopted in the future) in the manner described is equitable and would not
discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, applicants assert that such arrangements should not
give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially
identical. 

4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of
the Act was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Fund. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Fund's existing assets
or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the multi-class arrangement suggests that
it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares. 



Applicants' Conditions 



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of the Series, and be identical
in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Series will relate
solely to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate payments made under the distribution plans and any Shareholder
Services Plans; (b) the method of allocating certain Class Expenses which are limited to (i) transfer and shareholder
servicing agent fees and shareholder servicing costs, (ii) professional fees relating solely to one class, (iii)
trustees fees, including independent counsel fees, relating solely to one class, (iv) printing and postage expenses
for materials distributed to current shareholders, (v) Blue Sky and SEC registration fees, (vi) shareholder meeting
expenses, and (vii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to
one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (c) the fact that the class will vote separately
with respect to any matter specifically affecting that class, including without limitation rule 12b-1 distribution
plans and Shareholder Services Plans, except as provided in condition 16; (d) the different exchange privileges
of the classes of shares; (e) designation of each class of shares of the Series; and (f) certain classes that impose
a rule 12b-1 fee may be able to convert to a class with a lower rule 12b-1 fee.

2. The trustees of the Fund, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the system of the offering
of the various classes of shares. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees regarding deliberations of the trustees
with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class arrangement for any Series will reflect in detail
the reasons for the trustees' determinations that the system is in the best interests of that Series and its shareholders.


3. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes of outstanding
shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and Distributor of the Fund will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and Distributor at its own cost
will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.


4. The trustees of the Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In such statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class
of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related
to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.


5. Dividends paid with respect to each class of shares of a Series, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution plan fees
or Shareholder Services Plan fees and Class Expenses (listed in condition 1) applicable to a class will be borne exclusively
by that class.


6. Any Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.


7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to the applicants, a copy of which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
The Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor, on an ongoing basis, the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and based on that review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports,
following request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff
upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the SEC's Division of Investment Management,
limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant
Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the
expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on
policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS
No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA
from time to time.


8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the classes of shares. This representation has been concurred with the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert.


9. The prospectus of the Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to
one particular class of shares over another.

10. The Series will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services,
fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Series will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholders
reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related
to the Series as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Series' per share data, however, will be prepared
on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Series. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature
describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for
publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Series' net asset value and public offering price will present
each class of shares separately.
11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Fund to agree to conform to these
standards.
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
of the Fund with respect to the multi-class arrangement will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the
trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the trustees.
13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that may be made pursuant to the rule 12b-1 distribution
plans or a Shareholder Service Plan in reliance on the exemptive order.
14. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees of the Fund including a majority of the independent
trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet
Class Expenses shall provide to the trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report
of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
15. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.
16. If the Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plans (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a Shareholder Services Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target
Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless
the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall take such
action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class or
shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares.
If deemed advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing
Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all
material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. A New Target Class
or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this
condition shall be effected in any manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation.
In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New
Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the Adviser and Distributor. Purchase Class
shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum
payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase
Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release
No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Pulitzer Publishing Company,
Common Stock, $.01 Par Value) File No. 1-9329</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.



Pulitizer Publishing Company (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Chicago Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''). 

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:


According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolution on October 20,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the CHX. According to the Company, the decision of the
Board followed a study of the matter, and was based on the following:

(1) The Company's Common Stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') thus a market will
continue to be made in the issue; and 
(2) The Company is of the opinion that the volume of trading on the CHX is not substantial enough to warrant the continuation
of the dual listing. In the months of June and July 1993, the CHX executed four trades in the issue (4/10 of one percent
market share) for a total of 1,000 shares (6/100 of one percent market share).

Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Rand Capital Corporation,
Common Stock, $.10 Par Value) File No. 1-8205</DOCTITLE>


February 1, 1994.


Rand Capital Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'').
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
According to the Company, it has determined to voluntarily withdraw from listing and registration on the BSE the shares
of Common Stock based on the fact that such shares are currently listed and registered on NASDAQ and, therefore, the
listing on the BSE is duplicative, provides no significant advantages to the Company or its stockholders and is an
unnecessary expense.
Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

January 28, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or the ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS

: SAFECO Life Insurance Company (the ``Company''), SAFECO Separate Account C (the ``Separate Account'') and PNMR
Securities, Inc. (``PNMR''), collectively, the ``Applicants.''




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS:

 Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) thereof.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF THE APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Account which serves as a funding medium for certain individual flexible premium and individual single premium deferred
variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'') offered by the Company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations




1. The Company is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Washington on January 23, 1957.

2. Concurrent with the filing of the amendment to this application, the Separate Account filed an amended Form N-4
with the Commission, to register as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. The Separate Account currently will
be divided into subaccounts which will invest in shares of the portfolios of SAFECO Resource Series Trust or Scudder
Variable Life Insurance Fund.

<DOCNO> FR940207-2-00183 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940207-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. The Contracts will be distributed through PNMR, an affiliate of the Company, that is a broker-dealer registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.


4. The Contracts will be individual flexible premium and individual single premium deferred variable annuity contracts.
The Contracts provide for accumulation of Contracts values and payment of monthly annuity payments on a fixed and
variable basis. Certain of the Contracts will qualify for federal tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue
Code (``Qualified Contracts'') and certain of the Contracts will not (``Non-Qualified Contracts'').


5. The minimum initial and subsequent purchase payment for the flexible premium Qualified Contracts is $50. The minimum
initial purchase payment for the flexible premium Non-Qualified Contracts is $2,000, with a minimum subsequent
purchase payment of $250. The minimum initial purchase payment for the single premium Non-Qualified Contract is
$25,000; the minimum subsequent purchase payment is $2,500, with additional purchase payments allowed within a
six-month period following the remitting of the initial purchase payment.


6. Contract owners may transfer all or a portion of their interests in a subaccount to another subaccount of the Separate
Account. Such transfers may be made without charge, at any time prior to the date upon which annuity payments begin,
provided that there have been no more than twelve transfers made in a Contract year. If more than twelve transfers are
made in a single Contract year, the Company reserves the right to deduct a transfer charge from the amount which is transferred
which will equal the lesser of $10 or 2% of the amount transferred.


7. The minimum partial transfer amount is the lesser of $500 or the Contract owner's entire interest in the subaccount,
unless the Contract owner is participating in the automatic transfer program which provides for pre-establish automatic
transfers of at least $250 from a subaccount. No partial transfer will be made if the Contract owner's remaining Contract
value in the subaccount would be less than $500 after the transfer (unless the Contract owner is participating in the
automatic transfer program).






8. When the Contract value is less than $50,000, the Company will deduct an annual administration maintenance charge
of $30 from the Contract value on the last day of each Contract year and in the event of a full withdrawal. This charge
is designed to reimburse the Company for general administrative expenses which it incurs in the establishment and
maintenance of the Contracts and the Separate Account. Prior to the annuity date, this charge is not guaranteed, and
may be changed for future years; in no event may it exceed $35 per Contract year. Applicants represent that the charge
has not been set a level greater than its cost, and contains no element of profit.


9. In addition, relying on Rule 26a-1 of the 1940 Act, the Company deducts an asset-related administration charge
on each valuation date, at an annual rate of 0.15% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Account. This
charge is designed to cover the shortfall in revenues from the annual administration maintenance charge, and will
not increase. The Company does not intent to profit from this charge.


10. For each withdrawal (whether partial or full) after the first in any Contract year, the Company deducts a withdrawal
charge that equals the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn. The withdrawal charge is an administrative charge,


not 

a sales charge, and is used to pay for administrative expenses incurred by the Company in connection with withdrawals
after the first in any Contract year. No withdrawal charge is deducted when the Contract owner is participating in
the systematic withdrawal program or is exercising a settlement option.


11. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge. Instead, a full or partial withdrawal of a Contract prior
to the annuity date is subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDCS''). The CDSC is a declining charge which
is graded down 1% per year from 8% to 0% over eight years.


12. The Company assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risks arise from the contractual
obligation to make annuity payments for the life of the Annuitant, and to waive the CDSC in the event of the death of the
Contract owner. The expense risk assumed by the Company is that the actual expenses involved in administering the
Contracts may exceed the amount recovered from the annual administration maintenance charge and the asset-related
administration charge. To compensate it for assuming these risks, the Company deducts a mortality and expense risk
charge on each valuation date, at an annual rate of 1.25% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Account.
Approximately 0.90% of the 1.25% charge represents mortality risks and 0.35% represents expense risks.


13. Applicants state that if the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs, the loss
will be borne by the Company. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be a profit
to the Company. The mortality and expense risk charge is guaranteed by the Company not to increase.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions


1. Applicants request an exemption from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent relief is necessary
to permit the deduction from the Separate Account of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts.
2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act, as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust
and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds
of all payments (other than the sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under
arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such
reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services.
3. Applicants submit that the Company is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and
expense risks, and represent that the charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable variable annuity
contracts. Applicants state that these representations are based upon an analysis of the mortality risks, taking
into consideration such factors as: the guaranteed annuity purchase rates; the expense risks, taking into account
the existence of charges against Separate Account assets for other than mortality and expense risks; the estimated
costs, now and in the future, for certain product features; and industry practice with respect to comparable variable
annuity contracts. The Company will maintain at its principal office, and make available to the Commission, a memorandum
setting forth in detail the products analyzed and the methodology and results of this analysis.
4. Applicants acknowledge that the CDSC may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the
Contracts, and that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit
may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. In such circumstances a portion of the mortality
and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the costs relating to distribution of the Contracts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed
distribution financing arrangements made with respect the Contracts will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract
owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by the Company at its principal
office and will be available to the Commission.
5. Applicants represent that the Separate Account will invest only in underlying mutual funds that undertake, in
the event they adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such
plan formulated and approved by a board of directors or board of trustees, a majority of the members of which are not
``interested persons'' of such funds within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.


Conclusion


Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the
standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard, Applicants assert that the exemptions are necessary and
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the policies and purposes
of the 1940 Act.



For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order to amend previous orders (the ``Prior Orders'') that permitted the Shearson Funds to
(a) issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities and (b) assess and,
under certain circumstances, waive a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on redemptions of shares. The
present order is necessary because of the sale of the assets of Shearson to Primerica Corporation and Primerica's
subsidiary, Smith Barney.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.





Applicants' Representations



1. Each of the Funds is an open-end management investment company. Several of the Funds consist of multiple investment
portfolios or series, each of which has separate investment objectives and policies.

2. On March 12, 1993, Shearson Lehman Brothers (``Shearson'') entered into an asset purchase agreement with Primerica
Corporation and Primerica's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Smith Barney. The agreement provided for the sale
to Smith Barney and its designated affiliates of substantially all the assets of Shearson and the SLB Asset Management
Divisions of Shearson (the ``Transaction''). Upon the closing of the Transaction on July 31, 1993, Smith Barney became
the sponsor and distributor or underwriter of the Shearson Funds, which were formerly sponsored and distributed
or underwritten by Shearson. Shearson's corporate successor, Lehman Brothers, continues to serve as the distributor
of the Lehman Funds. (Smith Barney, Shearson, and Lehman Brothers are referred to as the ``Distributors.'')

<TEXT>
 

3. The investment advisory services that had formerly been provided to the Shearson Funds by Shearson or its subsidiaries
is now provided by Smith Barney or one of its investment advisory affiliates. Prior to the Transaction, Shearson served
as investment adviser to the Shearson Funds through Shearson Asset Management and Shearson Lehman Advisors, which
were investment advisory groups of the Asset Management Group of Shearson. Shearson Lehman Investment Strategy
Advisors Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shearson. Upon the closing of the Transaction, Shearson Asset Management
became a separate division of SBA called the Smith Barney Shearson Asset Management Division, and Shearson Lehman
Investment Strategy Advisors Inc. became the Strategy Advisers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBA. Also, upon the
closing of the Transaction, Shearson Lehman Advisors became a separate division of MMC called the Greenwich Street
Advisors Division. SBA and MMC are subsidiaries of Smith Barney.
4. The Prior Orders permitted the Shearson Funds to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the
same portfolio of securities and assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares.
 At the request of Shearson and Smith Barney, the Commission's Division of Investment Management informed Shearson
and Smith Barney that the Division would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action against them
if the Shearson Funds operate under the terms of the Prior Orders until the earlier of (a) the date the Prior Orders are
renewed by the Commission pursuant to a renewal order specifying Smith Barney and its subsidiaries or affiliates
as applicants or (b) June 8, 1994.
 Accordingly, applicants request an order that would continue and renew the exemption granted to the Shearson Funds
and grant the same exemptions to the other applicants.





5. Applicants request that relief be extended to any other investment company, or portfolio thereof, that is principally
underwritten by Smith Barney or Lehman Brothers that (a) is or becomes part of the same ``group of investment companies,''
and (b) offers shares that are identical in all material respects to the shares described in the application. (Such
funds are also the ``Funds.'')


A. The Variable Pricing System


1. Pursuant to the Prior Orders, applicants (other than the Smith Barney Fund, Smith Barney, Smith Barney Advisers,
and LBGAMI) implemented multiple distribution arrangements (the ``Variable Pricing System'') and amended arrangements
(the ``Amended Variable Pricing System''). Under the Amended Variable Pricing System, each of the Shearson Funds
could (a) Sell shares with a front-end sales load and a plan of distribution adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 under
the Act (``Rule 12b-1 Plan'') (``Class A shares''), (b) sell shares subject to a CDSC and a Rule 12b-1 Plan
(``Class B shares''), (c) sell shares without either a sales charge or a distribution or service fee for purchase by
investors specified below (``Class C shares''), (d) sell shares without a front-end load or CDSC but subject to a Rule
12b-1 Plan (``Class D shares''), and (e) establish one or more additional classes to be sold with different specified
sales load and service and distribution fee structures (``Additional Classes''). In addition, the Prior Orders
permitted the various classes to bear specified expenses (``Class Expenses'') that are directly attributable only
to a specific class.
2. Class C shares may be purchased by (a) Employee benefit and retirement plans of a Fund's distributor and its subsidiaries
or affiliates, (b) certain unit investment trusts (``UITs'') sponsored by a Fund's distributor and its subsidiaries
and affiliates,
 and (c) if authorized by a Fund's board (i) employees of a Fund's distributor and its subsidiaries and affiliates and
(ii) directors, general partners, or trustees of any investment company for which the distributor, its subsidiaries
and/or affiliates serve as distributor and, in each (i) and (ii), their spouses and minor children.




3. Applicants may offer an Additional Class subject to a non-rule 12b-1 administrative support services plan
between a Fund or the Fund's distributor and an organization in which the organization agrees to provide services
to their clients who may beneficially own shares of the Fund (such agreements are ``Plan Agreements''). The provision
of services under the Plan Agreements would augment or replace (and not be duplicative of) the services provided by
a Fund's investment adviser, transfer agent, and administrator.

<PARENT> FR940207-2-00084 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Under the Amended Variable Pricing System, all expenses incurred by a Shearson Fund are allocated among the various
classes of shares based on the net assets of the Shearson Fund attributable to each class, except that each class' net
asset value and expenses reflect the expenses associated with that class's Rule 12b-1 Plan or Plan Agreement
(if any), including any costs associated with obtaining shareholder approval of the Rule 12b-1 Plan and any
Class Expenses. Expenses of a Shearson Fund allocated to a particular class are borne on a 

pro rata

 basis by each outstanding share of that class. Applicants request an exemption to permit the Funds to allocate expenses
among the classes subject to the terms and conditions of the order permitting the Amended Variable Pricing System.


 

B. The CDSC 

 

1. The Prior Orders permit the imposition of a CDSC in connection with the redemption of Class B shares of the Shearson
Funds and on certain redemptions of Class A shares sold pursuant to a complete waiver of the front-end sales load applicable
to large purchases, if the shares are redeemed within one year of the date of purchase. Applicants request a renewal
and continuation of the Prior Orders to permit the Funds to impose a CDSC. 

 

Applicants' Legal Analysis 

 

1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities.
The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves.
The proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund, since all such shares
will participate in all of the Fund's appreciation, income, and expenses in the manner described above.

2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of
shares. Applicants submit that the reasons set forth in the Prior Orders with respect to the CDSC similarly apply with
the present request.


Applicants' Conditions


A. The Variable Pricing System


1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a Rule
12b-1 Plan or non-rule 12b-1 plan agreement providing for a service and/or distribution fee and any other
costs relating to obtaining shareholder approval of the Rule 12b-1 Plan for that class or an amendment to its
Rule 12b-1 Plan; (c) different Class Expenses for each class of shares which are limited to: (i) Transfer agency
fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses
related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current
shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) Commission registration fees
incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the
shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares;
and (vii) fees of members of the governing boards incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d)
except as described in condition 6 below, voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares (

e.g., 

the adoption, amendment, or termination of a Rule 12b-1 Plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in
rule 12b-1; (e) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares; and (f) the fact that certain
classes will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above
that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated
until approved by the Commission.
2. Any Plan Agreement will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that the holders of shares
issued pursuant to a Plan Agreement will not receive the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.
3. The members of the governing boards of each Fund, including a majority of the independent board members, shall have
approved the Amended Variable Pricing System prior to the implementation of the Amended Variable Pricing System
by that particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the members of the governing boards of each of the Funds regarding
the deliberations of their members with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Amended Variable Pricing
System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Amended Variable Pricing System is in the best interests
of both the Funds and their respective shareholders.
4. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and
any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the governing board of the affected Fund,
including a majority of the independent board members. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the governing board, and the governing board
shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures
were made.
5. On an ongoing basis, the members of the governing boards of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities
under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests
of the various classes of shares. The members of the governing boards of each Fund, including a majority of the independent
board members, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any conflicts that may develop. The
Advisers, Smith Barney Advisers, LBGAMI, and the Distributors will be responsible for reporting any potential or
existing conflicts to the members of the governing boards. If a conflict arises, the Advisers, Smith Barney Advisers,
LBGAMI, and the Distributors at its own costs will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered
management investment company.

6. If a Fund implements any amendment to its Rule 12b-1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the class of shares (``Target Class'') into which the class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase
Class'') will convert under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The members of the governing
board shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted
into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they
existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert
into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the members of the governing board to implement the foregoing, such
action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical
to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target
Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges
or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the members of the governing board reasonably
believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 5 above, any additional cost associated
with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by
the Advisers and Smith Barney Advisors and the Distributors. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation
of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material
features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an
effective registration statement.

7. The members of the governing boards of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements of distribution and
shareholder servicing revenues and expenditures for each respective class of shares (``Statements'') complying
with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the Statements, only expenditures
properly attributable to the sale or servicing of one class of shares will be used to support the rule 12b-1 or
servicing fee charged to shareholders of that class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of
a specific class of shares will not be presented to the members of the governing boards to support any fee charged to
shareholders of that class of shares. The Statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be
subject to the review and approval of the independent board members in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, and on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the Rule 12b-1 Plans or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plans relating to a particular class will
be borne exclusively by each respective class and except that any Class Expenses will be borne by the applicable class
of shares.

9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent
Examiner''). The Independent Examiner has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of
the Commission, stating that the methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and allocations
will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute
Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based
upon this review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being
made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the
Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect
to these reports, following a request by the Funds that the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by
the Commission's staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant,
the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant
Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``special purpose'' report on the ``design of
a system,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the several classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the several classes of shares and this representation will be concurred with by the Independent
Examiner in the initial report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner,
or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred
to in condition (9) above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective measures if the Independent Examiner or
appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 
 
11. The prospectuses of the Funds will include a statement to the effect that a financial consultant and any other person
entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares of the Funds may receive different levels of compensation
for selling one particular class of shares over another in a Fund. 
 
12. The Distributors will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be
sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform
to these standards. Applicants' compliance standards will require all investors eligible to purchase Class C shares
of a Fund offering such shares to invest in Class C, rather than in shares of any other class of the Fund. 
 
13. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the members
of the governing boards of the Funds with respect to the Amended Variable Pricing System will be set forth in guidelines
which will be furnished to the members of the governing boards as part of the materials setting forth the duties and
responsibilities of the members of the governing boards. 
 
14. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares other than Class C shares
in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Class C shares
will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for Class C shares will disclose the existence
of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will disclose the existence of Class C
shares and will identify the persons eligible to purchase shares of such class. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expense and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in each shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except Class C. Advertising materials reflecting the
expenses or performance data for Class C will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase Class C shares.
The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset
values and public offering prices will present each class of shares, except Class C shares, separately.
 
15. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
Rule 12b-1 Plans or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 
 
16. Purchase Class shares will convert to Target Class shares on the basis of the relative net asset value of the two
classes without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will
be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26
of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and
service fee to which they were subject prior to conversion. 
 


B. The CDSC 
 


1. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release
No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as the rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

Statutory Debarment Under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given of which persons have been statutorily debarred pursuant to  127.7(c) of the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120-130).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 38(g)(4)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. 2778, prohibits export licenses to be issued
to a person, or any party to the export, who has been convicted of violating certain U.S. criminal statutes, including
the AECA. The term ``person,'' as defined in  120.14 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR),
means a natural person as well as a corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other
entity, organization or group, including governmental entities. The ITAR, specifically  126.7(e), defines
the term ``party to the export'' to include the president, the chief executive officer, and other senior officers
and officials of the license applicant; the freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the license applicant;
and any consignee or end-user of any item to be exported. The statute permits certain limited exceptions to this prohibition
to be made on a case-by-case basis. 22 U.S.C. 2778(g)(4).




The ITAR,  127.7, authorizes the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs to prohibit
certain persons convicted of violating, or conspiring to violate, the AECA, from participating directly or indirectly
in the export of defense articles or in the furnishing of defense services. Such a prohibition is referred to as a ``statutory
debarment,'' which may be imposed on the basis of judicial proceedings that resulted in a conviction for violating,
or of conspiring to violate, the AECA. See 22 CFR 127.7(c). The period for debarment will normally be three years from
the date of the most recent conviction. At the end of the debarment period, licensing privileges may be reinstated
at the request of the debarred person following the necessary interagency consultations, after a thorough review
of the circumstances surrounding the conviction, and a finding that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate
any law enforcement concerns, as required by the AECA, 22 U.S.C. 2778(g)(4).

Statutory debarment is based solely upon a conviction in a criminal proceeding, conducted by a United States court.
Thus, the administrative debarment procedures, as outlined in the ITAR, 22 CFR part 128, are not applicable in such
cases.

The Department of State will not consider applications for licenses or requests for approvals that involve any person
or any party to the export who has been convicted of violating, or of conspiring to violate, the AECA during the period
of statutory debarment. Persons who have been statutorily debarred may appeal to the Under Secretary for International
Security Affairs for reconsideration of the ineligibility determination. A request for reconsideration must be
submitted in writing within 30 days after a person has been informed of the adverse decision. 22 CFR  127.7(d).

Environmental Impact Statement: Kern County, CA 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that a Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a
proposed transportation project in Kern County, California. The Tier 1 EIS is intended to satisfy requirements for
environmental evaluation of route location and right-of-way acquisition for corridor protection. Prior to facility
construction, Tier 2 project-specific environmental document(s) will be prepared.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), will prepare a Tier 1 Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) to identify a route and protect a corridor for Route 58 between Interstate 5 and State Route
99, a distance of 32.2 kilometers (20 miles), in Kern County and the City of Bakersfield. Existing Route 58 within the
project limits is a two-lane conventional highway from I-5 to Allen Road, a four-lane conventional highway
from Allen Road to SR 99, and a four-lane freeway east of SR 99. Existing development along the present roadway alignment
constrains opportunities to upgrade to freeway standards and to accommodate additional travel modes. The existing
facility operates at Level of Service (LOS) C to E, and is expected to decline to LOS D to F by year 2010. Additional capacity
is needed to meet future travel demand in the transportation corridor.





Alternatives under consideration are: (1) The ``No-Project'' alternative; (2) a Transportation Systems Management
alternative providing low cost, incremental improvements; (3) a Mass Transit Alternative providing commuter/light
rail and or bus transit; (4) the Seventh Standard alternative, a 32.2 kilometer (20 mile) corridor parallel to Seventh
Standard Road; (5) the Rosedale Highway alternative, a 29 kilometer (18 mile) corridor primarily parallel to and
approximately 0.4 kilometer (one-fourth mile) from Rosedale Highway; and (6) the Kern River alternative, a 24.1
kilometer (15 mile) corridor north of the Kern River and Stockdale Highway. The roadway alternative used for route
planning purposes and right-of-way corridor definition consists of an eight-lane freeway with an 18.3 meter (60-foot)
median and 3.1 meter (10-foot) shoulder. This corridor width would also accommodate a six-lane freeway with capacity
for a transit or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) facility. Access control and interchanges with existing highways and
local streets are included in determining the corridor examined.
