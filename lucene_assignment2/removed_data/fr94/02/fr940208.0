Food Stamp Program; Technical Amendments Concerning Disabled in Group Homes and Income Exclusion for Plans for Achieving
Self-Support



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule finalizes provisions of the proposed rule published on December 21, 1992 concerning certain provisions
of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 that dealt with disabled persons in group
homes and income exclusions for Plans for Achieving Self-Support. This final rule expands the food stamp eligibility
of certain blind and disabled individuals residing in group homes and excludes income of an SSI recipient necessary
for the fulfillment of a Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS).


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 



Executive Order 12778



 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: 

(1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and
7 CFR 273.15; 

(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules
related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); 

(3) for retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8.




Executive Order 12372. 



The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR part 3105, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983; or 48 FR 54317,
December 1, 1983, as appropriate), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires
intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



This final rule has also been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub.
L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has
certified that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
changes would affect food stamp applicants and recipients and State and local agencies which administer the Food
Stamp Program. 



Paperwork Reduction Act



This final rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB). 



Background 



The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-237, enacted December 13,
1991) (the FACT Act) contained several technical amendments to the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief
Act (Pub. L. 101-624). A proposed rule dealing with these technical amendments was published at 57 FR 60489 on
December 21, 1992 and provided the public with 60 days to comment on the proposed provisions. A total of five comments
were received regarding this proposed rule. Four State agencies and one public interest group commented on the provisions
of the proposed rulemaking. The concerns raised by the commenters are discussed below. For a full explanation of the
provisions of this rule, the reader should refer to the preamble of the proposed rule. 



Expanded Opportunity for Using Food Stamps to Pay for Meals in Certain Group Homes

Under current regulations, many, but not all, blind or disabled persons living in a group home may be certified for
food stamps. The reasons for this are discussed in detail in the proposed rule. The Department proposed to amend the
regulations to expand the provisions governing the eligibility of blind or disabled persons living in group homes
to include all persons defined as blind or disabled under Section 3 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C.
2012) (the Act). This expansion was authorized by section 901 of the FACT Act which amended section 3(g)(7) and 3(i)
of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2012 (g) and (i)) to expand eligibility to receive food stamps and to use them to purchase meals provided
by certified group living arrangements, to all individuals who meet the Act's definition of ``disabled'' contained
in section 3(r)(2)-(7) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2012 (r)(2)-(7)). 

The Department received three comments, all supporting the proposal. Two of the three commenters requested clarifications
about the rule. One of these two commenters requested that the provision be expanded to clarify whether the provisions
regarding eligibility of individuals residing in group homes applied to homes with less than four residents and group
homes not required to be licensed by the State. This provision does not modify the eligibility criteria of the group
home in which eligible individuals may reside; rather, it addresses the eligibility criteria of certain residents
of a group home. Thus, the commenter's concern is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. 

The second commenter requesting clarification wished to know how participation of residents in group homes would
be accomplished in an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) issuance system. The specifics of EBT interface in group
homes, drug/alcoholic treatment programs, shelters for battered women and children, and other specialized arrangements
need to be addressed during the development of a State agency's EBT system. Therefore, we are not addressing this concern
in this final rule. 

Accordingly, the Department is adopting as proposed the definitions of ``Eligible foods'' and ``Group living arrangement''
at 7 CFR 271.2. The Department is also adopting as proposed the provisions at 7 CFR 273.1(e)(1)(iii) and 273.11(f)
so that disabled or blind persons as (defined in 7 CFR 271.2) may apply for and receive food stamps and use their food
stamps to pay for meals provided by a group living arrangement. 



Exclude Plans for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) from Income 



Under 7 CFR 273.9(c) of the food stamp regulations, certain items are excluded from income in determining food stamp
eligibility and calculating benefits. Section 903 of the FACT Act and the provisions of Public Law 102-265 (making
technical corrections to the FACT Act) require that funds provided for a PASS plan be excluded from income for food
stamp purposes. The PASS program is designed to help Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients become self-supporting.
The plans, which must be approved by the Social Security Administration (SSA), permit an individual to set aside a
specified amount of money to be used or deposited into a special account for an approved purpose. The Department proposed
to amend the regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(c) to exclude PASS funds from income in determining food stamp eligibility
and benefits. The Department received four comments on this provision, three from State agencies and one from a public
interest group. Two commenters supported the provision; two commenters opposed the provision. 

One State agency opposed the provision because the State agency does not know how to identify income for a PASS account
and thus believes that there is a potential for error in excluding such income. The State agency believes that it is
necessary to establish a way for such income to be reported as PASS income before such income can be excluded. The exclusion
is required by statute; therefore, the Department must require that such income be excluded. It is the household's
responsibility to report and verify that such income is necessary for fulfillment of its PASS on order for the income
to be excluded. The household should be able to provide such verification because the SSA approves the individual's
PASS in writing, identifying the amount of income that shall be set aside each month to fulfill the PASS. Further, SSA
requires that the household provide for clear identification of the funds that are to be set aside. Eligibility workers
should ask SSI recipients during the interview whether they have a PASS.

Section 903 of the FACT Act and Pub. L. 102-265 provide for a 
food stamp exclusion for amounts necessary for the fulfillment of 
a PASS. In the proposed rule, the amendatory language for 7 CFR 
273.9(c) 

Income exclusions

 was: ``Income of an SSI recipient 
which has been determined necessary for the fulfillment of a plan 
for achieving self-support (PASS) * * *.'' The second commenter 
objected to the phrase ``which has been determined'' in the 
regulatory amendment. The commenter objected to the language 
because it believes that the phrase unnecessarily complicates the 
issue because the language in Section 903 of the FACT Act 
specifies exclusion of income necessary for fulfillment of a 
PASS. The Department has adopted the commenter's suggestion and 
deleted the phrase ``which has been determined'' from the final 
rule. Other than this deletion, the rule at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(17) is 
adopted as proposed. 



Implementation and Effective Dates 



The provisions extending food stamp eligibility to all blind or 
disabled persons (as defined by the Food Stamp Act) who live in 
certain group living arrangements and to include meals served to 
these blind or disabled persons as eligible for purchase with 
food stamps were effective and had to be implemented no later 
than February 1, 1992 in accordance with the provisions of the 
FACT Act and with a December 27, 1991 memorandum to all Regional 
Administrators of the Food and Nutrition Service. 

Also in accordance with that memorandum and the provisions of the 
FACT Act, the income exclusion for PASS accounts is effective on 
the earlier of: (1) December 13, 1991, the date of enactment of 
the FACT Act, (2) October 1, 1990, for food stamp households for 
which the State agency knew, or had notice, that a household 
member had a PASS, or (3) beginning on the date that a fair 
hearing was requested contesting the denial of an income 
exclusion for amounts provided for a PASS. State agencies are 
not required to do file searches for cases relating to PASS 
households unless the question of an income exclusion for PASS 
had been raised with the State agency prior to December 13, 1991.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Rule Concerning Disclosures of Energy Consumption and Water Use Information About Certain Home Appliances and Other
Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule revision.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission's Energy and Water Use Rule requires that Table 1, in  305.9, which sets forth the
representative average unit energy costs for five residential energy sources, be revised periodically on the basis
of updated information provided by the Department of Energy (``DOE'').



This document revises the table to incorporate the latest figures for average unit energy costs as published by DOE
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 29, 1993.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 19, 1979, the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule, then called the Appliance Labeling Rule (44
FR 66466), in response to a directive in section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (``EPCA''), 42 U.S.C.
6201.
 The rule requires the disclosure of energy efficiency or cost information on labels and in retail sales catalogs for
eight categories of appliances, and mandates that these energy costs or energy efficiency ratings be based on standardized
test procedures developed by DOE. The cost information obtained by following the test procedures is derived by using
the representative average unit energy costs provided by DOE. Table 1 in  305.9(a) of the rule sets forth the
representative average unit energy costs to be used for all requirements of the rule. As stated in  305.9(b),
the Table is intended to be revised periodically on the basis of updated information provided by DOE.





On December 29, 1993, DOE published the most recent figures for representative average unit energy costs. Accordingly,
Table 1 is revised to reflect these latest cost figures as set forth below.

The dates when use of the figures in revised Table 1 becomes mandatory in calculating cost disclosures for use in reporting,
labeling and advertising products covered by the Commission's rule and/or EPCA are as follows:



For 1994 Submissions of Data Under  305.8 of the Commission's Rule



The new cost figures must be used in all 1994 cost submissions. For convenience, the annual dates for data submission
are repeated here:




Fluorescent lamp ballasts: March 1

Clothes washers: March 1

Water heaters: May 1

Furnaces: May 1

Room air conditioners: May 1

Dishwashers: June 1

Central air conditioners: July 1

Heat pumps: July 1

Refrigerators: August 1

Refrigerator-freezers: August 1

Freezers: August 1



For Labeling and Advertising of Products Covered by the Commission's Rule



Using 1994 submissions of estimated annual costs of operation based on the 1994 DOE cost figures, the staff will determine
whether to publish new ranges. Any products for which new ranges are published must be labeled with estimated annual
cost figures calculated using the 1994 DOE cost figures. If such new ranges are published, the effective date for labeling
new products will be ninety days after publication of the ranges in the 

Federal Register

. Products that have been labeled prior to the effective date of any range modification need not be relabeled. Advertising
for such products will also have to be based on the new costs and ranges beginning ninety days after publication of the
new ranges in the 

Federal Register

.



Energy Usage Representations Respecting Products Covered by EPCA but not by the Commission's Rule Manufacturers
of products covered by section 323(c) of EPCA, but not by the Energy and Water Use Rule (clothes dryers, television
sets, kitchen ranges and ovens, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, pool heaters and space heaters) must use the 1994
representative average unit costs for energy in all representations beginning May 9, 1994.



List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 305



Advertising, Energy conservation, Household appliances, Labeling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.



PART 305_[AMENDED]



Accordingly, 16 CFR part 305 is amended as follows:




1. The authority citation for part 305 continues to read as follows:







Authority: 

42 U.S.C. 6294.




2. Section 305.9(a) is revised to read as follows:

contact with food. This action is in response to a petition filed by Hoechst Celanese Corp.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 17, 1993 (58 FR 48659), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 3B4393) had been filed by Hoechst
Celanese Corp., 500 Washington St., Coventry, RI 02816. The petition proposed that  178.3297 

Colorants for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.3297) be amended to provide for the safe use of 

N

-[4-(aminocarbonyl)phenyl]-4-[[1-[[(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1

H

-benzimidazol-5-yl)amino]carbonyl]-2-oxopropyl]azo]benzamide (C. I. Pigment Yellow 181) as a colorant in all
polymers intended for use in contact with food.


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe and that  178.3297(e) should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 10, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This regulation revises the Agency's current regulation implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Other
regulatory provisions regarding law enforcement records, fees for processing requests, and Executive Order No.

2. Sections 503.1 through 503.6 are revised to read as follows:



 503.1



Introduction and definitions.



(a) Introduction. The FOIA and this part apply to all records of the United States Information Agency, including all
of its foreign posts. As a general policy, USIA follows a balanced approach in administering the FOIA. We recognize
the right of public access to information in the possession of the Agency, but we also protect the integrity of the Agency's
internal processes. This policy calls for the fullest possible disclosure of records consistent with those requirements
of administrative necessity and confidentiality which are recognized by the Freedom of Information Act.

(b) Definitions_

Access Appeal Committee 

or 

Committee

, means the Committee delegated by the Agency Director for making final Agency determinations regarding appeals
from the initial denial of records under the FOIA. This Committee also reviews final appeal denials of documents made
by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) for its records.



Agency

 or 

USIA

 means the United States Information Agency. It includes all components of USIA in the U.S. and all foreign posts abroad
(known as the U.S. Information Service or USIS). (See 22 CFR part 504, chapter V_Organization.)



Commercial use

, when referring to a request, means that the request is from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose
that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request
is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to which the records
will be put. The identity of the requester (individual, non-profit corporation, for-profit corporation), or the
nature of the records, while in some cases indicative of that purpose or use, is not necessarily determinative. When
a request is from a representative of the news media, the request shall be deemed not to be for commercial use.



Department

 means any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation,
any independent regulatory agency, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal Government. A private
organization is not a department even if it is performing work under contract with the Government or is receiving Federal
financial assistance. Grantee and contractor records are not subject to the FOIA unless they are in the possession
and control of USIA.

Duplication 

means the process making a copy of a record and sending it to the requester, to the extent necessary to respond to the
request. Such copies include paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials, and magnetic tapes, cards and discs.



Educational institution 

means a preschool, elementary or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education,
or institution of professional or vocational education.



FOIA

 means section 552 of title 5, United States Code, as amended. 



Freedom of Information Officer 

means the USIA official who has been delegated the authority to release or withhold records and assess, waive, or reduce
fees in response to FOIA requests.



Non-commercial scientific institution 

means an institution that is not operated substantially for purposes of furthering its own or someone else's business,
trade, or profit interests, and that is operated for purposes of conducting scientific research whose results are
not intended to promote any particular product or industry.



Post 

or 

USIS 

means all overseas offices of the USIA.



Records 

means any handwritten, typed or printed documents (such as memoranda, books, brochures, studies, writings, drafts,
letters, transcripts, and minutes) and documentary material in other forms (such as punchcards; magnetic tapes,
cards, or discs; paper tapes; audio or video recordings; maps; photographs; slides, microfilm; and motion pictures).
It does not include objects or articles such as exhibits, models, equipment, and duplication machines or audiovisual
processing materials. Nor does it include books, magazines, pamphlets, or other reference material in formally
organized and officially designated USIA libraries, where such materials are available under the rules of the particular
library.



Representative of the news media 

means a person actively gathering news for an entity organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public.``News''
means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. News media entities
include television and radio broadcasters, publishers of periodicals (to the extent they publish ``news'') who
make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public, and entities that may disseminate
news through other media (e.g., electronic dissemination of text). Freelance journalists shall be considered representatives
of a news media entity if they can show a solid basis for expecting publication through such an entity. A publication
contract or a requester's past publication record may show such a basis.



Request 

means asking in writing for records whether or not the request refers specifically to the Freedom of Information Act.



Review 

means examining the records to determine which portions, if any, may be released, and any other processing that is
necessary to prepare the records for release. It includes only the first examination and processing of the requested
documents for purposes of determining whether a specific exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a
record.



Search 

means looking for records or portions of records responsive to a request. It includes reading and interpreting a request,
and also page-by-page and line-by-line examination to identify responsive portions of a document. However, it does
not include line-by-line examination where merely duplicating the entire page would be a less expensive and a quicker
way to comply with the request.



 503.2



Making a request.



(a) 

How to request records. 

All requests for documents shall be made in writing. Requests should be addressed to the United States Information
Agency, Freedom of Information Officer, GC/FOI, room M-301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547. Write the
words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' on the envelope and letter.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Details in your letter. 

Your request for documents should provide as many details as possible that will help us find the records you are requesting.
If there is insufficient information, we will ask you for more. Include your telephone number(s) to help us reach you
if we have questions. If you are not sure how to write your request or what details to include, you may call the FOIA Office.
The more specific the request for documents, the faster the Agency will be able to respond to your requests.
(c) 

Requests not handled under FOIA. 

We will not provide documents requested under the FOIA and this part if the records are currently available in the National
Archives, subject to release through the Archives, or commonly sold to the public by it or another agency pursuant
to statutory authority (for example, records currently available from the Government Printing Office or the National
Technical Information Service). Agency records that are normally freely available to the general public, such as
USIA World, are not covered by the FOIA. Also requests from Federal departments and court orders for documents are
not FOIA requests, nor are requests from Chairmen of Congressional committees or subcommittees.
(d) 

Referral of requests outside the agency. 

If you request records that were created by or provided to us by another Federal department, we may refer your request
to or consult with that department. We may also refer requests for classified records to the department that classified
them. In cases of referral, the other department is responsible for processing and responding to your request under
that department's regulation. When possible, we will notify you when we refer your request to another department.
(e) 

Responding to your request_

(1) 

Retrieving records. 

The Agency is required to furnish copies of records only when they are in our possession and control. If we have stored
the records you want in a records retention center, we will retrieve and review them for possible disclosure. However,
the Federal Government destroys many old records, so sometimes it is impossible to fill requests. The Agency's record
retention policies are set forth in the General Records Schedules of the National Archives and Records Administration
and in USIA's Records Disposition Schedule, which establish time periods for keeping records before they may be destroyed.
(2) 

Furnishing records. 

The Agency is only required to furnish copies of records which we have or can retrieve; we are not compelled to create
new records. For example, if the requested information is maintained in computerized form and we can, with minimal
computer instructions, produce the information on paper, we will do so_if this is the only way to respond to a request.
We are not, however, required to write a new computer program in order to print documentary material in a format you
might prefer. 
On the other hand, we may decide to conserve government resources and at the same time supply the records you need by
consolidating information from various records rather than copying them all. The Agency is required to furnish only
one copy of a record. If we are unable to make a legible copy of a record to be released, we will not attempt to reconstruct
it. Rather we will furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in our reply or on the copy. If material exists
in different forms, we will provide the record in the form that best conserves government resources. For example,
if it requires less time and expense to provide a computer record as a paper printout rather than on tape, we will provide
the printout.


 503.3

Availability of agency records.


(a) 

Release of records. 

If we have released a record or part of a record to others in the past, we will ordinarily release it to you also. This principle
does not apply if the previous release was an unauthorized disclosure. However, we will not release it to you if a statute
forbids this disclosure and we will not necessarily release it to you if an exemption applies in your situation and
did not apply or applied differently in the previous situations.
(b) 

Denial of requests. 

All denials are in writing and describe in general terms the material withheld and state the reasons for the denial,
including a reference to the specific exemption of the FOIA authorizing the withholding or deletion. The denial also
explains your right to appeal the decision and it will identify the official to whom you should send the appeal. Denial
letters are signed by the person who made the decision to deny all or part of the request, unless otherwise noted.

<PARENT> FR940208-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Unproductive searches.

 We make a diligent search for records to satisfy your request. Nevertheless, we may not be able always to find the records
you want using the information you provided, or they may not exist. If we advise you that we have been unable to find the
records despite a diligent search, you will nevertheless be provided the opportunity to appeal the adequacy of the
Agency's search. However, if your request is for records that are obviously not connected with this Agency or your
request has been provided to us in error, a ``no records'' response will not be considered an adverse action and you
will not be provided an opportunity to appeal.
(d) 

Appeal of denials. 

You have the right to appeal a partial of full denial of your FOIA request. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing
and address it to the official identified in the denial letter. Your appeal letter must be dated and postmarked within
30 calendar days from the date of the Agency's denial letter. Because we have some discretionary authority in deciding
whether to release or withhold records, you may strengthen your appeal by explaining your reasons for wanting the
records. However, you are not required to give any explanation. Your appeal will be reviewed by the Agency's Access
Appeal Committee which consists of senior Agency officials. When the Committee responds to your appeal, that constitutes
the Agency's final action on the request. If the Access Appeal Committee grants your appeal in part or in full, we will
send the records to you promptly or set up an appointment for you to inspect them. If the decision is to deny your appeal
in part or in full, the final letter will state the reasons for the decision, name the officials responsible for the
decision, and inform you of the FOIA provisions for judicial review.


 503.4

Time limits.


(a) 

General. 

The FOIA sets certain time limits for us to decide whether to disclose the records you requested, and to decide appeals.
If we fail to meet the deadlines, you may proceed as if we had denied your request or your appeal. Since requests may be
misaddressed or misrouted, you should call or write to confirm that we have the request and to learn its status if you
have not heard from us in a reasonable time.
(b) 

Time allowed. 

(1) We will decide whether to release records within 10 working days after your request reaches the appropriate area
office that maintains the records you are requesting. When we decide to release records, we will actually provide
the records at that time, or as soon as possible after that decision, or let you inspect them as soon as possible thereafter.
(2) We will decide an appeal within 20 working days after the appeal reaches the appropriate reviewing official.
(3) The FOI Officer or appeal official may extend the time limits in unusual circumstances for initial requests or
appeals, up to 10 working days. We will notify you in writing of any extensions. ``Unusual circumstances'' include
situations where we: Search for and collect records from field facilities, records centers or locations other than
the office processing the records; search for, collect, or examine a great many records in response to a single request;
consult with another office or department that has substantial interest in the determination of the request; and/or
conduct negotiations with submitters and requesters of information to determine the nature and extent of non-disclosable
proprietary materials.



 503.5

Records available for public inspection.


(a) To the extent that they exist, we will make the following records of general interest available for your inspection
and copying:
(1) Orders and final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions in adjudications. (See  503.8(e)
of this part for availability of internal memoranda, including attorney opinions and advice.)

<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Statements of policy and interpretations that we have adopted but have not published in the 

Federal Register

.

(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect the public. (We will not make available, however,
manuals or instructions that reveal investigative or audit procedures as described in  503.8 (b) and (g) of
this part.)

(4) In addition to such records as those described in paragraph (a) of this section, we will make available to any person
a copy of all other Agency records, unless we determine that such records should be withheld from disclosure under
subsection (b) of the Act and   503.8 and 503.9 of this part.

(b) Before releasing these records, however, we may delete the names of people, or information that would identify
them, if release would invade their personal privacy to a clearly unwarranted degree. (See  503.8(f).)

(c) This Agency does not publish an FOIA index because it is impracticable to do so.



 503.6



Restriction on some agency records.



Under the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1461, as amended), the USIA is prohibited
from disseminating within the United States information about the U.S., its people, and its policies when such materials
have been prepared by the Agency for audiences abroad. This includes films, radio scripts and tapes, video tapes,
books, and similar materials produced by the Agency. However, this law does provide that upon request, such information
shall be made available at USIA for examination only by representatives of the press, magazines, radio systems and
stations, research students or scholars and available for examination only to Members of Congress.

Iowa Permanent Regulatory Program




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 OSM is announcing the approval of a program amendment submitted by Iowa as a modification to the State's permanent
regulatory program (hereinafter, referred to as the ``Iowa program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment pertains to exemptions for coal extraction incidental to the extraction of other
minerals, restriction of financial interests of State employees, exemption of coal extraction incident to government-financed
highway or other construction, protection of employees, initial regulatory program, areas unsuitable, permits
for operations and exploration, small operator assistance, bonding and insurance, permanent program performance
standards, inspection and enforcement, blaster certification, and contested cases and public hearings. The amendment
is intended to revise the State program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards, clarify ambiguities,
and improve operational efficiency.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Background on the Iowa Program




On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of Interior conditionally approved the Iowa program. General background information
on the Iowa program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Iowa program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5885). Subsequent actions concerning Iowa's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 915.15 and
915.16.




II. Submission of Amendment




From October 1, 1983, to December 20, 1989, a number of changes were made to Federal regulations concerning surface
coal mining and reclamation operations. During this time period, pursuant to Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17,
OSM notified Iowa in four separate 732 letters dated December 12, 1988, (Administrative Record No. IA-336);
May 11, 1989, (Administrative Record No. IA-340); November 28, 1989, (Administrative Record No. IA-347);
and February 7, 1990, (Administrative Record IA-349), that the State rules must be amended to be consistent
with the revised Federal regulations.




By letter dated November 23, 1992 (Administrative Record No. IA-372), Iowa submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Iowa submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying the outstanding
732 notifications from OSM and the required program amendments OSM placed on its program in a November 6, 1991, rulemaking
action (56 FR 56578) at 30 CFR 915.16(a) of the Federal regulations.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the January 14, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 4376) and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period ended on February 16, 1993. The public hearing
scheduled for February 8, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. 




During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns related to Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) 27-40.1(3),
General; 27-40.3(207), General; IAC 27-40.4(10), Full water year; IAC 27-40.21(207), Areas designated
by an Act of Congress; IAC 27-40.31(207), Requirements for permits and permit processing; IAC 27-40.32(207),
Revision, renewal, and transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights; IAC 27-40.34, Permit application_minimum
requirements for legal, financial, compliance, and related information; IAC 27-40.39(1), Requirements
for permits for special categories of mining; IAC 27-40.61(1), Permanent program performance standards_general
provisions; IAC 27-40.63, Permanent program performance standards_surface mining activities; IAC 27-40.67,
Permanent program performance standards_coal preparation plants not located within the permit area of a mine; IAC
27-40.73(2)g, Enforcement; IAC 27-40.74, Civil penalties; and IAC 27-40.75, Individual civil
penalties. OSM notified Iowa of the concerns by letter dated May 10, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA-381).






Iowa responded in a letter dated July 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA-383), by submitting revised language
for the proposed amendment to address the concerns raised by OSM. On July 21, 1993, OSM published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 38991) announcing receipt of revised language for the proposed amendment and inviting public comment on its
adequacy. The public comment period ended August 5, 1993. By letters dated August 20, 1993 (Administrative Record
No. IA-388), and August 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA-389), Iowa provided OSM with additional
information to clarify and correct three editorial errors. These clarifications are discussed in the appropriate
findings to follow. 



III. Director's Findings



1. Provisions Not Discussed 



Iowa proposes revisions to its rules that involve minor editorial and word changes, and recodification. Iowa also
proposes to revise its current incorporation by reference of OSM's regulations from those in effect as of July 1, 1987,
to those in effect as of July 1, 1992.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Director finds that these proposed revisions, unless specifically discussed below, are no less effective than
the Federal regulations and is approving them.



2. Provisions Not Discussed That Are Substantively the Same as the Counterpart Federal Regulations



Iowa proposes revisions to rules that contain language that is the same or similar to the counterpart Federal regulations,
replace Federal references and terms with appropriate State references and terms, or add specificity without adversely
affecting other aspects of the program regulation. The Director, therefore, finds that these proposed revisions
to Iowa's regulations are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations. These
revisions are as follows (Federal regulation counterparts are indicated in brackets): IAC 27-40.4(207) and
40.4(6), concerning the permanent regulatory program and the exemption for coal extraction incidental to the extraction
of other minerals [30 CFR Part 702]; IAC 27-40.4(7)(f)(2), concerning the impact of a request for administrative
review by persons adversely affected on an exemption determination [30 CFR 702.11(f)(2)]; IAC 27-40.4(8)(3),
concerning the impact of a petition for administrative review on a decision to revoke an exemption [30 CFR 702.17(c)(3)];
IAC 27-40.31(15), concerning a permittee's right to appeal for administrative review [30 CFR 773.21(c)];
IAC 27-40.33(1) and (2), concerning general content requirements for permit applications [30 CFR 777.11(a)(3)
and 777.14(a)]; IAC 27-40.35(1) and (3), Vegetation information and land use [30 CFR 779.19(a) and (b)]; IAC
27-40.35(9), Climatological information [30 CFR 779.18]; IAC 27-40.35(13), Identification of public
roads [30 CFR 779.24(h)]; IAC 27-40.51(5), concerning soil productivity levels required for release of performance
bonds on prime farmlands [30 CFR 800.40(c)(2)]; IAC 27-40.73(2)g, concerning notification of owners and controllers
of a permit upon issuance of a cessation order [30 CFR 843.11(g)]; IAC 27-40.74(6), concerning procedures to
prepare a request for a hearing on a violation [30 CFR 845.19]; IAC 27-40.74(7), concerning procedures for determining
final assessment of a violation [30 CFR 845.20]; and IAC 27-40.75(3), concerning final order and opportunity
for review of a penalty assessment [30 CFR 846.17(b)(1)].



3. Iowa Code Chapter 207



In the letter dated July 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA-383), submitting revised language for the proposed
amendment in response to OSM concerns, Iowa notified OSM that the Iowa Code has been reorganized in an attempt to achieve
more logical groupings by agency and function in the Code. Therefore, Iowa Code chapter 83 is now Iowa Code chapter
207. Iowa indicated that no substantive changes were made to the statute. All references to Iowa Code chapter 83 in
the Iowa Administrative Code have been revised to read Iowa Code chapter 207. OSM approves the recodification based
upon its understanding that no substantive changes were made to the statute.



4. Provisions Adopting Suspended Federal Regulations



Iowa proposes to adopt by reference several Federal regulations or portions thereof that are suspended. In its cover
letter dated July 8, 1993, Iowa indicated it's intention to adopt the suspension rule announcements located at the
end of the sub-Parts to the Federal regulations as published in the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, the
Director considers any proposed Iowa rule adopting a suspended Federal regulation noted in the 30 CFR as of July 1,
1992, to also be suspended in the State program. Therefore, the Director finds that with this clarification, these
proposed State rules are no less effective than the Federal counterpart regulations and is approving them. The following
is a list of the proposed Iowa rules adopting suspended Federal regulations as noted in the July 1, 1992, 30 CFR and the


Federal Register

 notices that explain the Federal suspensions.

5. Required Program Amendments



Iowa submitted proposed revisions in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR 915.16(a) of the Federal regulations
that OSM placed on the Iowa program in the November 6, 1991, final rule 

Federal Register 

notice (56 FR 56578, 56594). The Director finds that the following proposed State regulations satisfy the required
program amendments and are no less effective than the Federal regulations indicated in each required program amendment,
and the Director is approving them [the codified required amendments at 30 CFR 915.16 are indicated in brackets]:
IAC 27-40.11(2), by deleting from incorporation by reference the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 710.12 and by
insuring that the appropriate State citations are substituted for incorporated Federal citations, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(2)];
IAC 27-40.13(207), by deleting from incorporation by reference subparagraphs (1) through (5) from the Federal
regulation at 30 CFR 716.1(a), [30 CFR 915.16(a)(3)]; IAC 27-40.21(5) and (7), by specifying that the general
word substitutions for ``Act'' and ``Secretary'' at rule IAC 27-40.1(207) do not apply to the incorporated
30 CFR 761.3 and by removing the incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 761.12(c), [30 CFR 915.16(a)(4)]; IAC 27-40.51(5)
by insuring that the phrase ``and Part 823 of this chapter'' is incorporated in its rule, [915.16(a)(7)]; IAC 27-40.61(1)
through (4) by requiring that the performance standards and design requirements of Iowa's approved program be followed
and by deleting the reference to ``Parts 818 through 828'' and replacing it with ``Parts 819, 823, 827, and 828,'' [30
CFR 915.16(a)(8)]; IAC 27-40.63 (207) and 27-40.64 (207) by providing design criteria for the construction
or modification of coal mine waste refuse piles, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(9)]; IAC 27-40.63 (207) by incorporating
by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.104 and .105 that define thick and thin overburden, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(11)];
IAC 27-40.66(207) by deleting from its incorporation by reference the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 823.11(a)
thereby requiring that prime farmland occupied by all coal preparation plants, support facilities and roads that
are a part of the surface mining activities meet the applicable prime farmland performance standards, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(12)];
IAC 27-40.67(2) by deleting from incorporation by reference subchapters 30 CFR 827.13(a)(1) through (3) that
deal with interim performance standards that are not applicable to the Iowa program, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(14)]; IAC
27-40.72(3)b by requiring that the name of the person who is or may be adversely affected shall not be disclosed
unless confidentiality had been waived or disclosed, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(15)]; IAC 27-40.73(2)c by referencing
the appropriate counterpart rule to section 521(a)(5) of SMCRA, which is Iowa Code Section 207.14(6), [30 CFR 915.16(a)(16)];
IAC 27-40.73(6)e by referencing the State statute that establishes procedural requirements for formal adjudicatory
hearings, which is Iowa Code Chapter 17A, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(17)]; IAC 27-40.73(6)g by referencing Iowa Code
section 207.14 which contains provisions corresponding to section 521(a)(4) and 525 of SMCRA, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(18)];
IAC 27-40.74(5), (6), and (7) by replacing the current rules with rules that are substantively the same as the
corresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 845.18, .19, and .20 thereby: (1) providing rule specific procedures for conducting
informal settlements; (2) providing that the proposed penalty amount be put in escrow prior to the commencement of
the assessment conference; and (3) providing escrow account handling provisions, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(19)]; IAC 27-40.82(1)
by deleting 30 CFR 955.1 and .2 regarding certification of blasters since they are not applicable to the State, [30
CFR 915.16(a)(20)]; and IAC 27-40.99(1)d. and (2) by deleting the reference to Iowa Code section 207.14, subsection
4, and instead referring to Iowa Code section 17A.15(3), the provision that establishes procedures for appealing
the decision of an administrative law judge, [30 CFR 915.16(a)(21)].

Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendments as identified above from the Iowa program
and as codified at 30 CFR 915.16.



6. IAC 27-40.1 (3) and (4), IAC 27-40.35, IAC 27-40.37, IAC 27-40.38, IAC 27-40.63, and
IAC 27-40.64, Authorization of Land Surveyors



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.1 (3) and (4) by deleting from 30 CFR 779.25(b), 780.14(c), 780.25(a)(1)(i),
780.25(a)(3)(i), 783.25(b), 784.16(a)(1)(i), 784.16(a)(3)(i), 816.46(b)(3), 816.49(a)(2), 816.49(a)(10)(ii),
816.151(a), 817.46(b)(3), and 817.151(a), as incorporated by reference into the State program, specific language
which allows land surveyors to prepare and certify certain cross-sections, maps, and plans. Iowa also proposes,
at IAC 27-40.37 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 783), IAC 27-40.38 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 784), IAC 27-40.63
(incorporating 30 CFR Part 816), and IAC 27-40.64 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 817), to make similar changes to
the incorporated language which allows land surveyors to prepare and certify certain cross-sections, maps, and
plans.

Section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations allow land surveyors to prepare and certify such cross-sections,
maps, and plans only to the extent allowed by the State. Thus, this option is discretionary to the State regulatory
authority and Iowa's decision not to allow land surveyors to perform such duties does not render Iowa's program inconsistent
with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Iowa, in a previous program amendment submittal, received approval from the
Director on November 6, 1991, to prohibit land surveyors from performing design and certification tasks in other
locations of its program (56 FR 56578, 56584).

In Iowa's July 8, 1993, response to OSM's May 10, 1993, concerns on this amendment, some of the Federal regulations
incorporated by reference at IAC 27-40.1 (3) and (4) included similar, but slightly different language from
the language the State proposed to delete.

Therefore, Iowa submitted an editorial clarification to OSM in a letter dated August 20, 1993 (Administrative Record
No. IA-388), to clarify the exact language that the State proposed to delete from the incorporated Federal provisions.
Consequently, the Director finds Iowa's proposed revisions at IAC 27-40.1 (3) and (4), IAC 27-40.35 (incorporating
30 CFR Part 779), IAC 27-40.37 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 783), IAC 27-40.38 (incorporating 30 CFR Part
784), IAC 27-40.63 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 816), and IAC 27-40.64 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 816),
and IAC 27-40.64 (incorporating 30 CFR Part 817), to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and
is approving the revisions.



7. IAC 27-40.1(5), Registered, Professional Engineer



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.1(5) by deleting the words ``registered, professional engineer''
from its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Parts 779, 780, 783, 784, 816, and 817. Iowa proposes to replace the deleted
phrase with the phrase ``professional engineer, registered with the State of Iowa.'' This proposed change insures
that professional engineers meet State registration requirements.

The Director finds the proposed revision at IAC 27-40.1(5) to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations
and is approving it.



8. IAC 27-40.3(207), General



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Iowa, at IAC 27-40.3(207), proposes to revise its rules by deleting 30 CFR 700.12, dealing with petitions to
initiate rulemakings, from its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 700. OSM, in its May 10, 1993, issue letter
(Administrative Record No. IA-381) to Iowa, expressed concern that, by deleting the incorporation of 30 CFR
700.12, Iowa would be left without any rule to provide procedural requirements pertaining to such petitions. In a
letter dated July 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA-383), Iowa supported its decision to delete 30 CFR 700.12
by explaining that the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship promulgated rules to provide procedural
requirements for petitions to initiate rulemaking at IAC 21-3. The Iowa rules at IAC 21-3, in turn, adopt
the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, Chapter X, that set forth procedures for handling petitions for rulemaking.
Iowa submitted both the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, Chapter X, and IAC 21-10 for OSM's review.
Iowa further explained in its July 8, 1993, letter that rule IAC 21-3.5(17A) addresses petitions received for
related entities and that ``[w]hile the Division has its own rulemaking authority separate from the Secretary of
Agriculture, the Division is an entity of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship * * * .
Any petitions received relative to the coal regulatory program will be so forwarded.'' OSM understands Iowa's explanation
to mean that any petitions received by the Secretary of Agriculture relative to the coal regulatory program will be
forwarded to the Division for processing in accordance with IAC 21-3 and the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure,
Chaper X.
Upon review of IAC 21-3 and the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, the Director finds them to be no less effective
than the Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 700.12 and is approving them. With regard to Iowa's proposed revision
at IAC 27-40.3(207), to delete the incorporation of 30 CFR 700.12 of the Federal regulations, the Director finds
this deletion acceptable so long as Iowa amends this rule to clearly identify IAC 21-3 as governing procedures
regarding petitions for initiating rulemaking. Thus, the Director is requiring Iowa to further amend its rules at
IAC 27-40.3 by clearly identifying IAC 21-3 as governing procedures regarding petitions for initiating
rulemaking.


9. IAC 27-40.4(9), Definition for ``Previously Mined Area''


Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.4(9) by deleting the Federal definition for ``previously mined
area'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and inserting in lieu thereof the following:



``Previously mined area'' means land previously mined on which there were no surface coal mining operations subject
to the standard of the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-87, as amended); all highwalls
created after August 3, 1977, and all fully reclaimed sites are excluded from this definition.



Iowa's proposal is in response to a required amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) (November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 56594)),
that required the State to provide a definition for ``previously mined area'' that excludes all highwalls created
after August 3, 1977, and all fully reclaimed sites. The Director finds that Iowa's proposal satisfies the required
amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) and the Director is, therefore, approving the proposed definition.
Since the required amendment was promulgated at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1), however, on January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3466), OSM
issued a new definition for ``previously mined area.'' The new definition provides as follows: ``

Previously mined area 

means land affected by surface coal mining operations prior to August 3, 1977, that has not been reclaimed to the standards
of 30 CFR chapter VII.''

This definition limits the applicability of 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106 to those areas mined prior to August 3, 1977,
that are either unreclaimed or reclaimed to lesser standards than those prescribed by SMCRA, while also ensuring
that areas mined prior to that date that have been fully and satisfactorily reclaimed pursuant to SMCRA's standards
will not be redisturbed and then reclaimed under the less stringent requirements of 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106. According
to the preamble discussion for the definition of ``previously mined area,'' under the definition, unreclaimed or
partially reclaimed areas mined prior to August 3, 1977, would continue to qualify for the partial highwall elimination
exemption of 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106, but would be otherwise held to full compliance with the reclamation standards
of 30 CFR chapter VII. In such instances, the operator would be required to eliminate the highwall to the maximum extent
technically practical, and to demonstrate the stability of the remaining highwall remnant.
As stated above, Iowa's proposed definition explicitly excludes all highwalls created after August 3, 1977, and
all fully reclaimed sites. It is not explicitly clear, however, that the proposed Iowa definition is consistent in
all respects with the newly-promulgated Federal definition. For example, under the Federal definition, in order
for land to qualify as a ``previously mined area,'' the land must both: (1) have been affected by surface coal mining
operations prior to August 3, 1977; and (2) not have been reclaimed to the standards of 30 CFR chapter VII.

<PARENT> FR940208-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

By comparison, under the State proposal, the key consideration in determining whether an area of land qualifies as
previously mined area, is whether the previous surface coal mining operations there were ``subject to the standards
of the [SMCRA] * * *'' To the extent the State proposal relies upon whether an area of land was subject
to the standards of SMCRA, it is similar to the previous Federal definition of ``previously mined area,'' promulgated
on May 8, 1987 (52 FR 17526, 17529).

As discussed in the preamble to the promulgation of the current Federal definition of ``previously mined area,''
the 1987 Federal definition of that term was remanded by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.


See National Wildlife Federation

 v. 

Lujan

, 733 F. Supp. 419, 438-442 (1990). The Court found that the 1987 definition did not conform to the requirements
of SMCRA to the extent it relied upon any date other than the date of SMCRA's enactment_August 3, 1977. 

Id.

Therefore, although the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27-40.4(9) satisfies the previous required
amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) and is approving it, the Director is requiring Iowa to further amend its definition
of ``previously mined area'' at IAC 27-40.4(9) to be explicitly no less effective than the current Federal definition
at 30 CFR 701.5. The Director will modify the required amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) in accordance with this finding.



10 IAC 27-40.21(207), Definition for ``Valid Existing Rights''



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.21(207) by incorporating by reference the definition for ``valid
existing rights'' (VER) at 30 CFR 761.5 as it existed on July 1, 1992. Paragraphs (a) and (c) of the definition were suspended
on November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952, 41954-41955). In that suspension notice, OSM stated the following with regard
to Federal Programs and the Indian Lands Program:




 * * * Suspending the rule has the effect of undoing the improper promulgation and leaving in place the
VER test in use before the 1983 definition was promulgated. That test was the 1979 test, including the ``needed for
and adjacent'' test, as modified by the August 4, 1980, suspension notice which implemented the District Court's
February 1980 opinion in In Re: Permanent (I)

 (the 1980 test) * * * Under the 1980 test, a demonstration of both property rights and that the person
either had made a good faith effort to obtain all permits necessary to mine or that the coal is both needed for and adjacent
to an ongoing surface coal mining operation is sufficient to establish VER.

Accordingly, OSM will make VER determinations in Federal program States and on Indian lands using the 1980 test. OSM
will make VER determinations on a case-by-case basis after examining the particular facts of each case, and will consider
property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which by that date had made a good faith effort to obtain
all permits, as one class of circumstances which would invariably entitle the property owner to VER. VER would also
exist when there are property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which can demonstrate that the coal
is both needed for an immediately adjacent to a mining operation in existence prior to August 3, 1977.




As discussed in Finding no. 4 of this document, Iowa has indicated its intention to adopt the suspension notices located
at the end of the federal regulations published in the Code of Federal regulations. Thus, as applied to the definition
of VER, the Director interprets Iowa's adoption of the Federal definition to include the above-quoted language language
from the November 20, 1986, preamble. The Director will notify Iowa of any change in the Federal regulation in accordance
with 30 CFR 732.17(d) and may in the future require Iowa to modify its regulatory program to remain consistent with
the Federal provision. In the meantime, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed adoption by reference of the definition
for VER at 30 CFR 761.5.



11. IAC 27-40.31(2), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.31(2) by requiring that the words ``and the scale of the map'' be
added at the end of the last sentence of 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1)(ii), as incorporated by reference into the State program.
In addition, Iowa proposes to add the following paragraph to 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1)(ii), as incorporated by reference
into the State program:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The legal description shall include popular township, county, township, range, section, and the United States Geological
Survey map identification by property owners. Section lines shall be marked and the sections shall be identified
on the map. The total acreage of the proposed permit area shall be given to the nearest acre.




While the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1) do not require such detailed information, in accordance with
section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use
and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent
than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion
to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations
for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State
provisions shall not construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving
Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.31(2).


12. IAC 27-40.31(9), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing


Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.31, to add paragraph (9) that specifies that the general word substitution of the
term ``Act'' with the term ``Iowa Code chapter 207'' found at IAC 27-40.1(2) does not apply to 30 CFR 773.15(b),
as incorporated by reference into the Iowa program.
The incorporated Federal regulation, 30 CFR 773.15(b), requires that no permit be issued if any surface coal mining
and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant
``is currently in violation of the Act or any other law, rule or regulation referred to in [30 CFR 773.15],'' as indicated
by any available information, including the list of violation notices submitted in the application. Among the specified
violations are:




Federal and State failure-to-abate cessation orders, unabated Federal and State imminent harm cessation orders,
delinquent civil penalties issued pursuant to section 518 of the Act, bond forfeitures where violations upon which
the fortfeitures were based have not been corrected, delinquent abandoned mine reclamation fees, and unabated violations
of Federal and State laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in
connection with any surface coal mining operation. . . .




The preamble to the Federal regulation dated October 3, 1988 (53 FR 38868, 38886, clarifies that all unabated violations
are included, no matter when they were issued:




The Act requires regulatory authorities to consider past conduct in the permitting process. . . . In
view of [sections 507(b)(4), (b)(5), and 510(c)] of the Act, it is clear that Congress both contemplated and authorized
holding applicants accountable for past violations.




Furthermore, permit denial is based on violations of any State or Federal program. As explained in the preamble to
30 CFR 778.14(c) dated September 28, 1983 (48 FR 44344, 44389), the reference to ``the Act'' in SMCRA section 510(c),
on which these Federal regulations are based, includes all State and Federal programs approved under SMCRA. 

See also 

(53 FR 38868, 38882-38883) October 3, 1988. Therefore, in the context of the State's incorporation by reference
of the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b), the term ``Act'' must be understood to have the same meaning that it has
under the Federal program.
The Director therefore finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.31(9) to be consistent with SMCRA and the
Federal regulations and is approving it.


13. IAC 27-40.31 (13) and (14), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing


a. 

Time frame for permit application objections. 

Iowa proposes to revise its rule at IAC 27-40.31 that addresses comments and objections on permit applications
by adding a paragraph (13) that would replace the phrase ``a reasonable time established by the regulatory authority''
in incorporated 30 CFR 773.13(b)(1) with the phrase ``60 days of the notification.'' This would allow those public
entities identified at 30 CFR 773.13(b)(1) 60 days to submit written comments or objections with respect to the effects
of the proposed mining operations on the environment within their areas of responsibility. OSM interprets the phrase
``60 days of the notification'' to mean 60 days from the date of 

receipt 

of the notification required to be given to specific public entities under 30 CFR 773.13(a)(3).

The allowance of 60 days from the date of receipt of the notification of an application for a permit action for the governmental
entities identified at 30 CFR 773.13(a)(3) to submit written comments or objections is a reasonable time frame and
is consistent with the time frames allowed for in SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds this proposed revision to be
no less effective than the Federal regulation in meeting SMCRA's requirements and is approving it.

b. 

Reapplication requirements

. Iowa proposes to revise its rule at IAC 27-40.31(14), dealing with the review of permit applications, to require
that the following sentence be added at the end of incorporated 30 CFR 773.15(a)(2): ``In case willful suppressing
or falsifying of any facts or data is identified, the division may require the applicant to reapply for the same area.''

Iowa's proposed revision conflicts with SMCRA, the Federal regulations, and other provisions of the Iowa program.
Section 510(b)(1) of SMCRA and section 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1) of the Federal regulations provide that no application
for a permit or permit revision shall be approved unless the application affirmatively demonstrates and the regulatory
authority finds in writing on the basis of information set forth in the application or from information otherwise
available which will be documented in the approval, and made available to the applicant, that the permit application
is accurate and complete and that all the requirements of this Act and the State or Federal program have been complied
with. Counterpart State provisions to section 510(b)(1) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1) can be found in the Iowa program
at section 207.9(2)(a) of the Iowa Code and IAC 27-40.31 (incorporating 30 CFR 773.15 by reference).

Thus, under SMCRA, the Federal regulations, and the Iowa program, in the event willful suppressing or falsifying
of any facts or data is identified, the regulatory authority would have no discretion and would be required to deny
the permit. Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed added language at IAC 27-40.31(14) to be less stringent
than SMCRA, less effective than the Federal regulations in meeting SMCRA's requirements, and inconsistent with
approved Iowa program. Accordingly, the Director is not approving it.

The Director also notes that under the Federal, as well as the State, program, anyone who knowingly makes any false
statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make any statement, representation, or certification
in any application, record, report, plant, or other document filed or required to be maintained under the program,
is subject to criminal penalties, including imprisonment.

14. IAC 27-40.32, Revision; Renewal; and Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights



a. 

Revisions and amendments

. Iowa proposes to revise its rule at IAC 27-40.32(1) by adding an introductory provision that explains that
the term ``revision'' is used to describe ``a change to a permit that constitutes a significant departure from the
original permit. Any change to an Iowa permit that does not constitute a significant departure from the original permit
is called an ``amendment'' to the permit in the context of these rules.'' The introductory provision continues by
requiring that the public notice, public participation, and notice of decision requirements of 30 CFR 773.13, 773.19(b),
and 778.21 apply to all revisions.

Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27-40.32(1) by clarifying that ``[s]ignificant departures, including incidental
boundary revisions, shall be treated as revisions.'' Significant departures include any change in the permit area,
mining method or reclamation procedure, which would, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, significantly
change the effect the mining operations would have on either those persons impacted by the permitted operation or
on the environment. At IAC 27-40.32(3), Iowa clarifies that, unless it qualifies as an incidental boundary
revision, any change in permit area must be treated as a new permit application.

<TEXT>
 

At IAC 27-40.32(1), Iowa also proposes to add a sentence to the end of the State's substitute paragraph (b) for
30 CFR 774.13(b) that requires ``[a] change which does not constitute a significant departure from the original permit
will be processed as an amendment to the permit[.]''
Iowa proposes to add a new paragraph (6) at IAC 27-40.32 that modifies its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR
774.13(a) by adding the following at the end of the incorporated Federal regulation:




The ``revision'' is a significant departure in mining and reclamation operations defined at subrule 40.32(1)(b)(2)(i),
and it requires a public notice. The division uses the term ``amendment'' for an insignificant revision, and it does
not require a public notice.




The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 774.13 do not address permit ``revisions'' versus ``amendments'' specifically,
however, 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) requires the regulatory authority to create guidelines establishing the scale or extent
of revisions for which all the permit application information requirements and procedures of 30 CFR Chapter VII,
Subchapter G, including the public notice, public participation, and notice of decision requirements of 30 CFR   773.13,
773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21, shall apply. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) also specify that such
requirements and procedures shall apply ``at a minimum to all significant permit revisions.''
There are four concerns regarding Iowa's proposed changes to its program. First, Iowa has language in its program,
at IAC 27-40.32(2), that provides, in part:




Any application for a revision which proposes 

significant alterations 

in the operations described in the materials submitted in the application for the original permit under Part 3 of these
rules or in the conditions of the original permit, shall, at a minimum, be subject to the requirements of Part 9 of these
rules and must provide replacement documentation fully describing changes to be made in the same detail as required
in the original permit (emphasis added).




By comparison, the proposed language at 27-40.32 (1) and (6) described above refers to 

significant departures 

and significant departures appear to only be required to provide public participation and public notice. Therefore,
it appears that Iowa is proposing a two-tiered system for revisions: an all-inclusive revision, referred to as a significant
alteration, which requires full replacement documentation and adherence to the requirements of Part 9, and a subset
to the significant alteration, referred to as a significant departure, which only requires public participation
and notice.
Second, the preamble to the Federal rules at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) dated September 28, 1983, (48 FR 44344, 44377) makes
it clear that all revisions to the permit, whether they be significant or insignificant, or in Iowa's case a revision
or an amendment, must be approved by the regulatory authority and incorporated into the permit.




Under the final rule, the regulatory authority will establish the guidelines for revisions. However, all revisions
must be approved and incorporated into the permit since they are changes to that document. The permit and all public
copies of it should reflect all revisions approved by the regulatory authority so that all interested persons, including
inspectors, the operator, and the public, will have an accurate copy of the permit. The permit is the document which
authorizes the operator to mine and must be accurate.




The first paragraph of proposed IAC 27-40.32(1) seems to require that any change to a permit be approved by the
regulatory authority, either by amendment or revision. At a later section of proposed IAC 27-40.32(1), however,
Iowa states that:




[(b)](2) A revision or amendment to a permit shall be obtained:

(i) For changes in the surface coal mining or reclamation operations described in the original application and approved
under the original permit, 

when such changes constitute a departure from the method or conduct of mining and reclamation operations contemplated
in the original permit 

(emphasis added).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00039 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Thus, in one portion of the proposal Iowa seems to require, like the Federal regulations, that all changes to a permit
be approved by the regulatory authority. However, in another portion of the proposal, Iowa seems to require such regulatory
authority approval only for a particular type of change to a permit. Moreover, Iowa does not insure that all revisions
(significant departures and amendments) be incorporated into the permit and all public copies of the permit.

Third, the Federal regulations set forth criteria for approval at 30 CFR 774.13(c) that govern all permit revisions,
whether significant or nonsignificant. Iowa has, at proposed 27-40.32(207), incorporated by reference the
Federal provision at 30 CFR 774.13(c) into the Iowa program. However, in the context of the Iowa program, the term ``permit
revision'' only includes significant revisions. Thus, the Federal regulations require that the criteria at 30 CFR
774.13(c) govern the approval of 

all

 revisions, while the State proposal requires that such criteria govern only the approval of significant revisions.

Finally, Iowa has not outlined what permit application standards and procedures apply to amendments. The preamble
to 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) dated September 28, 1983 (48 FR 44344, 44377), clearly requires the regulatory authority to
establish guidelines as to what requirements will apply to nonsignificant revisions (i.e. amendments) to the permit.

In light of the concerns outlined above, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rules at IAC 27-40.32(1) and 32(6)
to be inconsistent with and less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving them to the extent
that these proposed rules attempt to distinguish between permit amendments and revision.

b. 

Permit review.

 Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27-40.32(1) and .32(1)(b)(2)(ii) in response to a required program amendment placed
on the Iowa program at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(5). This required program amendment directed Iowa to require that the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21 apply, at a minimum, to all significant permit revisions
and that the division may, at any time, as well as at midterm review, require reasonable revisions or modifications.

Iowa, at IAC 27-40.32(1), proposes to require that 30 CFR 773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21 apply, at
a minimum, to all significant permit revisions. However, since the Director is not approving Iowa's proposed distinction
between permit amendments and revisions, this proposed language does not work in the context of the existing rules
at IAC 27-40.32(1). Therefore, the Director is not approving the proposed language at IAC 27-40.32(1).

Iowa, at IAC 27-40.32(1)(b)(2)(ii), proposes to require that the division may, at any time, as well as at midterm
review, require reasonable revisions or modifications. Therefore, the Director finds that Iowa has adequately
addressed this portion of the required program amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(5) and is approving the proposed language
at IAC 27-40.32(1)(b)(2)(ii).

The Director will amend the required program amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(5) in accordance with this finding.

c. 

Incidental boundary revisions.

 Iowa proposes to add a requirement to IAC 27-40.32(3) that incidental boundary revisions (IBR's) shall be considered,
on demonstration by the operator, for an area in which the proposed mining operations are contiguous to the approved
permit. OSM interprets the proposed language to mean that before an area of land can be added to a permit as an IBR, it
must be contiguous to the approved permit.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 774.13(d) do not specifically require that lands subject to an IBR be contiguous
to the approved permit area. However, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover,
the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations
on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provisions exists. Section 505(b)
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal
program. Therefore, the Director finds that the reproposed rule at IAC 27-40.32(3) is not inconsistent with
SMCRA or the Federal regulations and is approving it.

d. 

Permit renewal exclusion. 

Iowa proposes to add a new paragraph (8) at IAC 27-40.32 that would exclude the need for a permit renewal if the
Division determines that the phase II bond was released over the entire permit area before the expiration of the permit
term. This proposed language is similar to OSM's final rule at 30 CFR 773.11(a) published in the April 5, 1989, 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 13814), that establishes that a permittee need not renew the permit if no surface coal mining operations will
be conducted under the permit and solely reclamation activities remain to be done.

However, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 773.11(a) continues by requiring that obligations established under a
permit continue until completion of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, regardless of whether the authorization
to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired or has been terminated, revoked, or suspended. Iowa incorporates
by reference, at IAC 27-40.31(207), that portion of 30 CFR 773.11(a) which requires that obligations established
under a permit continue until completion of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, regardless of whether
the authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired or has been terminated, revoked, or suspended.
Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27-40.32(8) to be no less effective than the Federal
regulation and is approving it.

e. 

Permit application information. 

Iowa proposes to add a new paragraph (9) at IAC 27-40.32 that modifies its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR
774.15(b)(2)(i) to require that, in addition to the application information required by the Federal provision for
a permit renewal, an applicant must also provide information concerning the ``current status of the mine plan, other
details and the time table_if different from the one previously approved_for the remaining phases of the operation
and reclamation plans.''

While the corresponding Federal regulation does not require this additional information, in accordance with section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental
controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed
under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land
use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal
counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed
to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC
27-40.32(9).



15. IAC 27-40.34(3), Permit Application_Minimum Requirements for Legal, Financial, Compliance, and Related
Information



Iowa proposes to add, at IAC 27-40.34, a paragraph (3) that specifies that the general word substitution of the
term ``Act'' with the term ``Iowa Code chapter 207'' at IAC 27-40.1(2) does not apply to 30 CFR 778.14(c), as incorporated
by reference into the Iowa program, regarding minimum information requirements about violations that must be included
in any permit application. As discussed in Finding No. 12 of this document, references to ``the Act'' in the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 778.14(c) and section 510(c) of SMCRA include, in addition to SMCRA and its implementing regulations,
all State and Federal programs approved under SMCRA. 

See e.g. 

(48 FR 44344, 44389) September 28, 1983. 

See also 

(53 FR 38868, 38882-38883) October 3, 1988.

Thus, 30 CFR 778.14(c) requires information regarding violations received pursuant to SMCRA or any State or Federal
law, rule, or regulation enacted or promulgated pursuant to SMCRA. In addition, 30 CFR 778.14(c) requires information
regarding violations received pursuant to any non-SMCRA Federal law, rule, or regulation, or any non-SMCRA State
law, rule, or regulation which was enacted pursuant to Federal law, rule, or regulation, which pertains to air or water
environmental protection and which were received in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation.
Therefore, in the context of the State's incorporation by reference of the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 778.14(c),
the term ```Act'' must be understood to have the same meaning that it has under the Federal program.

The Director finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.34(9) to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations
and is approving it.



16. IAC 27-40.35 (10) and (11), Climatological Information



a. 

Rain gauge identification 

Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27-40.35(10) by adding a paragraph (c) to the incorporated Federal regulation at
30 CFR 779.18 that would provide as follows:




Location of the rain gauges nearest to the permit area, preferably in the same watershed as the permit itself, shall
be marked on a map, and these shall be described in the text as well, along with the period of available record at these
gauges.




While the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 779.18 do not require this information, in accordance with
section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use
and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent
than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion
to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations
for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State
provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving
Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 

27-40.35(10).



b. 

Climatological impact description. 

Iowa proposes to revise IAC 

27-40.35(11) by adding a paragraph (d) to the incorporated Federal regulation at 30 CFR 779.18 that would provide
as follows:




A brief descrition shall be provided about the impact of the climatological factors on operation and reclamation
plans, specifically what part of the year would be more conducive than others to various mining and reclamation operations.




While the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 779.18 do not require this information, in accordance with
section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use
and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent
than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion
to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations
for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State
provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving
Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 

27-40.35(11).

a. 

Hydrologic area. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.35(12), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 779.24(g) by deleting
the phrase ``defined by the regulatory authority.'' Iowa further proposes to add the following sentence at the end
of incorporated 30 CFR 779.24(g): ``Hydrologic area'' is the area that consists of the permit area and the adjacent
area.'' Thus, the Iowa proposal would require permit applications to include maps showing, among other things, the
locations of water supply intakes for current users of surface water flowing into, out of, and within the permit and
adjacent area.
Iowa adopts by reference at IAC 27-40.4(207), the term ``adjacent area'' as it is defined at 30 CFR 701.5. The
definition for ``adjacent area'' includes the area outside the permit area where resources, determined according
to the context in which 

adjacent area

 is used, are or reasonably could be expected to be adversely impacted by proposed mining operations, including probable
impacts from underground workings. In explaining the meaning of the term ``adjacent area,'' OSM stated in the 

Federal Register 

notice dated April 5, 1983 (48 FR 14814, 14818-14819), that:



The term ``adjacent area'' is intended to refer to an area of variable size in which specified resources could be adversely
impacted by mining operations. The size of the adjacent area could vary on a case-by-case basis depending upon whether
impacts on water, fish and wildlife, cultural resources, or others are being considered  * * * .


* * * * *


* * *  The area determined to be within the ``adjacent area'' must be defined within the context
of the particular resource being evaluated and often will depend upon local conditions. * * * Thus,
the adjacent area may differ from case to case depending upon the factors under consideration. This can best be resolved
by the regulatory authority within the context of the particular requirement of the regulatory program and the conditions
within the particular State, region, or locale where the proposed mining operation is located.



Thus, Iowa's proposed revision ensures that permit application maps will illustrate the locations of all water supply
intakes for current users whose surface water supply will or could reasonably be expected to be adversely affected
by the proposed mining operations. Accordingly, the Director finds IAC 27-40.35(12) to be consistent with
SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations, and is approving it.
b. 

Section and section line identification. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.35(14), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 779.24(1) by inserting
the following at the beginning of the regulation: ``Section lines and section identification, and any * * *.''
Thus, as revised by the State, the incorporated provision would require that permit applications include maps showing,
among other things, ``[s]ection lines and section identification, and any other relevant information required
by the regulatory authority.''
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 779.24(1) simply allows the regulatory authority to require other information.
While the corresponding Federal regulations 30 CFR 779.24(1) do not require the information regarding section lines
and section identification, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover,
the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations
on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b)
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal
program. Therefore, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.35(14).


18. 

IAC 27-40.36(3), Surface Mining Applications_Minimum Permit Requirements for Reclamation and Operation
Plan and IAC 27-40.38(8), Underground Mining Permit Applications_Minimum Permit Requirements for Reclamation
and Operation Plan



Iowa proposes to add the following new language at IAC 27-40.36(3) and 27-40.38(8), which deal with minimum
requirements for reclamation and operations plans for surface and underground mining permit applications, respectively:




The determination of probable hydrologic consequence (PHC) made pursuant to these rules as part of a permit application
shall address all proposed mining activities associated with the permit area for which authorization is sought as
opposed to addressing only those activities expected to occur during the term of the permit.



In a November 6, 1991, rulemaking (56 FR 56578, 56584-56578), OSM requested that Iowa clarify how it intended
to implement 30 CFR 780.21(f) and 784.14(d) regarding PHC determinations. The State proposal satisfies the concerns
OSM expressed in Finding No. 15 of the November 6, 1991, 

Federal Register 

document. Accordingly, the Director finds the State proposals at IAC 27-40.36(3) and 27-40.38(8) to
be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving them.

a. Water quality measurement. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.36(5), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 780.21(a) by adding the
following sentence at the end of the regulation: ``The methodology for measurement of the quantity of both surface
water and groundwater shall also be described.'' OSM interprets this to mean that such measurement methodologies
must be described in the permit application, although the State proposal does not explicitly so provide. The Federal
regulation at 30 CFR 780.21(a) requires that all water-quality analyses performed shall be conducted according
to the methodology in the 15th edition of ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' or the methodology
in 40 CFR Parts 136 and 434 but the regulation does not specify that the methodology for measurement of the quantity
of both surface water and groundwater shall also be described.

However, section 30 CFR 777.13(a) requires all technical data submitted in the application be accompanied by, among
other things, a description of the methodology used to collect and analyze the data. Iowa incorporates 30 CFR 777.13(a)
at IAC 27-40.33(207). Hence, the addition of this proposed language simply reiterates the need for a description
of the methodology used. Therefore, The Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.36(5).

b. 

Water information requirements. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.36(6), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 780.21(d) by deleting
the phrase ``may be required by the regulatory authority'' and replacing it with the phrase ``is required.'' The deleted
phrase provided the State with discretion whether to require actual surface and groundwater information be provided
when modeling techniques, interpolation or statistical techniques are included in the permit application. Iowa,
by removing this phrase, will now require the actual surface and groundwater information to be included in all permits
applications.

The Director finds that this is a matter left to the discretion of the State regulatory authority under the Federal
regulations. Accordingly, the Director finds this proposed revision at IAC 27-40.36(6) to be no less effective
than the Federal regulations and is approving it.



20. IAC 27-40.37(4), Cross Sections, Maps, and Plans



Iowa proposes to revise its rule at 27-40.37(4) to correct a typographical error. The current language provides
that the first sentence in incorporated 30 CFR 783.24, dealing with informational requirements for underground
mining permit applications, is changed to read ``The permit application shall include cross sections at a vertical
exaggeration of 10:1, maps at a scale of 1:2400, and plans showing. . . .'' The State provision thus
specifies more detailed requirements for cross sections and maps than are specified in the Federal regulations at
30 CFR 783.25(a). This State provision, along with IAC 27-40.35(a), the parallel State provisions for surface
mining permit applications, was approved by OSM on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 56579-56580), as a provision
that added specificity to the Iowa program without adversely affecting other aspects of the program.

Iowa, in its July 8, 1993, submission proposed to correct the provision to require cross sections with a vertical exaggeration
of 1:10, instead of 10:1. However, in revising the provision, Iowa inadvertently created another typographical
error by requiring cross sections with a vertical exaggeration of 10:11:10. Consequently, Iowa, in a letter dated
August 20, 1993, submitted an editorial clarification to is revised rule to clarify that the provision requires cross
sections with a vertical exaggeration of 1:10. OSM understands Iowa's intent to exaggerate the vertical scale of
a relief map or cross section in order to make the map or section more clearly perceptible. Therefore, in Iowa's case,
the scale of vertical representation is exaggerated 10 times compared to the horizontal.

The Director finds this proposed revision to be no less effective than the Federal requirement and is approving it.


21. IAC 27-40.39(8), IAC 27-40.67.1, and IAC 27-40.67(3), Coal Preparation Plants Not Located
Within the Permit Area of a Mine



Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27-40.39(8) to require that the following clarifying sentence be added to incorporated
30 CFR 785.21(a): ``An off-site processing plant operated in connection with the mine but off the mine site will be
regulated without regard to its proximity to the mine.'' Iowa also proposes to add a rule at IAC 27-40.67(1) that
would delete the Federal regulation 30 CFR 827.1 from Iowa's incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 827. Finally,
Iowa proposes to add a rule at IAC 27-40.67(3) that states ``[p]roximity shall not be the decisive factor in deciding
to regulate an offsite processing plant.''
These proposed rule changes are in response to, and satisfy, required program amendments placed on Iowa's program
at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(6) and (13) in a November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 56594-56595), rulemaking action.
These proposed rule changes are also in accordance with OSM's latest clarification of its position regarding regulation
of off-site coal preparation plants. In a final rule 

Federal Register

 notice published on January 8, 1993, (58 FR 3466, 3468) OSM stated its position as follows:




OSM's position on the proximity issue, as clarified today in this final rule, is that surface mining regulatory authorities
may consider geographic proximity as a factor in determining whether off-site coal processing facilities operate
in connection with a mine as long as proximity is not the decisive factor. To allow proximity to be the decisive factor
would render ``in connection with'' equivalent to ``at or near.'' That is not the Secretary's intent.




Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rules at IAC 27-40.39(8), IAC 27-40.67(1), and IAC 27-40.67(3)
to be consistent with the Federal program and is approving them. The Director will amend 30 CFR 915.16(a) by removing
the required program amendments at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(6) and 30 CFR 915.16(a)(13).


22. IAC 27-40.51(7), Bond Release Application


Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.51(7) to modify 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2), as incorporated by reference
into the Iowa program, by deleting the phrase ``Within 30 days after an application for bond release has been filed
with the regulatory authority, the permittee shall submit a copy of an advertisement placed'' and inserting in its
place the following: ``After an application for bond release is deemed complete by the division, an advertisement
shall be placed by the permittee within 30 days of the date of notification of completeness.'' In addition, Iowa proposes
to add the following sentence after the first sentence of 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2), as modified: ``The permittee shall
submit a copy of the advertisement to the division within 30 days of the last publication.''
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2) do not require a permittee to obtain a ``notification of completeness''
prior to placing an advertisement announcing an application for bond release. Under the Federal regulations, the
advertisement is placed within 30 days after the application has been filed with the regulatory authority. Iowa proposes
to delay the advertisement until it can verify that the application is complete.
While the concept of requiring a permittee to obtain a notification of completeness prior to placing the advertisement
is not considered less effective than the Federal program, the implementation of this concept would render Iowa's
program less effective than the Federal program because of the inherent contradiction this revision would create
in the State rules regarding applicable time limits for the processing of bond release applications.

That is, the Iowa proposal retains the provision of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2) that requires the
regulatory authority to notify the involved parties of its decision on the bond release application ``[w]ithin 60
days from the filing of the bond release application * * *'' However, under the proposed revision,
once an application is submitted, and allowance is made for: (1) The permittee obtaining a notice of completeness;
(2) the permittee's 30-day time frame for placing the newspaper advertisement; (3) the running of the advertisement
of four successive weeks; and (4) the permittee's 30 day time frame for submitting a copy of the advertisement to the
regulatory authority, it would be virtually impossible for the regulatory authority to ever comply with the 60-day
notification requirement of 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2). Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at 27-40.51(7)
is less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2) and is not approving it. 



 23. IAC 27-40.63(207) and (2), Contemporaneous Reclamation, Backfilling and Grading Time and Distance Requirements



Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.63(207), to incorporate by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 816
as they were in effect on July 1, 1992. This would include the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 816.101 concerning backfilling
and grading time and distance requirements. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 816.101 was suspended on July 31, 1992
(57 FR 33874), in compliance with a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal dated April 16, 1992, entered by the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in 

National Coal Association and American Mining Congress 

v. 

U.S. Department of the Interior, et al.

, Civil No. 92-0408-CRR. The impact of this suspension is that all coal mining operations are subject to
the State-specific contemporaneous reclamation rules currently in effect.

In addition, Iowa, at IAC 27-40.63(2), proposes to delete the last sentence of 30 CFR 816.100, concerning contemporaneous
reclamation, from its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 816, and replace it with the requirement that:




Contemporaneous reclamation shall not exceed 180 days following coal removal and shall not be more than four spoil
ridges behind the pit being worked, the spoil from the active pit being considered the first ridge. The regulatory
authority may grant additional time for rough backfilling and grading if the permittee can demonstrate, through
a detailed written analysis under 30 CFR 780.18(b)(3), that additional time is necessary.




Since the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.100 only contains one sentence, the Director interprets Iowa's intent to
be a complete deletion of the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.100.

The State's proposed substitute language for 30 CFR 816.100 is substantively the same as the language found in the
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.101 (a)(2) and (b). The combination of the State's proposed substitute language
for 30 CFR 816.100 and the incorporation of 30 CFR 816.101, will provide the Iowa program with backfilling and grading
time and distance performance standards.

Iowa's deletion of 30 CFR 816.100 which requires backfilling, grading, topsoil replacement, and revegetation to
occur as contemporaneously as practicable on all lands disturbed by surface mining activities, does not render Iowa's
program less effective than the Federal program because contemporaneous reclamation requirements are found elsewhere
in the Iowa program.

As discussed above, the Iowa program contains time and distance performance standards for backfilling and grading.
Moreover, the contemporaneous reclamation requirement for revegetation, incorporated by reference by Iowa at
IAC 27-40.63(207), is provided for at 30 CFR 816.113.

With regard to the requirement of 30 CFR 816.100 that topsoil replacement occur as contemporaneously as practicable
with mining operations, while there is no specific State counterpart provision, logic maintains that if revegetation
is completed contemporaneously, topsoil replacement, which must be done prior to revegetation, is also contemporaneous.
Nevertheless, the Director finds that, in order to be no less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.100, Iowa must amend its program to explicitly require that topsoil replacement occur as contemporaneously
as practicable with mining operations.

Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27-40.63(2) to be no less effective than the Federal
program and is approving it. The Director also finds that Iowa's incorporation of the Federal regulation at 30 CFR
816.101 does not render its program less effective than the Federal program and is approving it. However, the Director
is requiring Iowa to further amend its program to explicitly require that topsoil replacement occur as contemporaneously
as practicable with mining operations.



24. IAC 27-40.63(207) and 27-40.64(207), Design Criteria for the Construction or Modification of Coal
Mine Waste Refuse Piles



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.63(207) and 27-40.64(207) by incorporating by reference
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 816 and 817, including 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83, as they existed on July 1, 1992.

Iowa's current rules, approved by the Director in a November 6, 1991, rulemaking (56 FR 56578), incorporate the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83 as they existed on July 1, 1987, including the editorial notes at the end of these
regulations. These editorial notes state that 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83 are suspended insofar as they ``permit the
construction of coal refuse piles using lifts of greater than 2 feet thickness.'' The Director, in the same November
6, 1991, rulemaking, placed a required program amendment on Iowa's program at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(10). This required
program amendment directed Iowa to amend its rules to provide design criteria, specifically, for lift thickness
and long-term stability. Iowa has chosen, instead, to incorporate the current Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.83
and 817.83, as reinstated on June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21764, 21765-21766), that do not impose specific design criteria
for lift thickness and long-term stability, but instead impose performance standards to assure stability.

The Director finds that Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.63(207) and 27-40.64(207) regarding design
criteria for the construction or modification of coal mine waste refuse piles is no less effective than the Federal
regulations and is approving them. Consequently, the Director is removing the required program amendment at 30 CFR
915.16(a)(10).



25. IAC 27-40.63(9), Impoundment Inspections



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at 27-40.63(9) by adding the following sentence to 30 CFR 816.49(a)(10)(i),
as incorporated by reference into the State program: ``Yearly inspection of the impoundments shall be done in the
second quarter of each calendar year, and the inspection report shall be submitted to the Division with the second
quarter water monitoring report.'' The Division, by adopting this revision, is fixing the time of the yearly inspections.

The corresponding Federal regulation requires a yearly inspection but does not set a specific time that the yearly
inspection must be conducted. Therefore, the State regulatory authority is implicitly given the discretion to provide
for such specific time frames. Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.63(9) to
be no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulation and is approving it.

26. IAC 27-40.63(12), Disposal of Noncoal Mine Wastes



Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.63(12) by deleting 30 CFR 816.89, dealing with disposal of noncoal
mine wastes, from the State's incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 816 and inserting, in lieu thereof, the following:




(a) Noncoal mine wastes including, but not limited to, grease, garbage, abandoned mining machinery, lumber and other
combustible materials generated during mining activities shall be placed and stored in a controlled manner in a landfill
permitted by the Iowa department of natural resources (DNR) pursuant to 561 IAC 101, 102, and 103. Lubricants, paints,
and flammable liquids may not be buried in the State of Iowa but, along with and (sic) other toxic wastes, must be disposed
of in the legally prescribed manner. Iowa law prohibits final disposal of noncoal wastes within the permit area.

Pending final disposal at a permitted DNR facility, noncoal mine waste shall be placed and stored in a controlled manner
in a designated portion of the permit area so as to ensure that leachate and surface runoff do not degrade surface or
ground water, that fires are prevented and that the area remains stable and suitable for reclamation and revegetation
compatible with the natural surroundings.

Noncoal mine waste shall at no time be deposited in a refuse pile or impounding structure.

No excavation for or storage of noncoal mine waste shall be located within eight feet of any coal outcrop or coal storage
area.

(b) Final disposal of noncoal mine wastes shall be in a designated, State-approved solid waste disposal site permitted
by the Iowa department of natural resources pursuant to 561 IAC 101, 102, and 103.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, any noncoal mine waste defined as ``hazardous'' under section
3001 of the resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-580 as amendment) and 40 CFR Part 261 shall
be handled in accordance with the requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA and any implementing regulations.




The State proposal differs from the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.89 in several respects. First, Iowa's proposed
rule makes it clear that, in Iowa, lubricants, paints, and flammable liquids may not be buried and must be disposed
of in the legally prescribed manner. This difference between the State and the Federal provisions does not render
the State program less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulation since the Federal provision
at 30 CFR 816.89(b) explicitly provides that operation of a disposal site shall be conducted in accordance with all
local, State, and Federal requirements.

Second, Iowa's proposed rule also makes it clear that there can be no final disposal of noncoal wastes within the permit
area. Instead, final disposal of noncoal mine wastes must be in a landfill permitted by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources. This provision of the Iowa program is no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal
counterpart provisions since the Federal provision at 30 CFR 816.89(b) requires that final disposal of noncoal mine
waste shall be in a designated disposal site in the permit area 

or 

a State-approved solid waste disposal area.

Third, at subsection (c), the Iowa proposal requires that any noncoal mine waste defined as ``hazardous'' under section
3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Federal regulations at 40 CFR Part 261 shall be handled
in accordance with the requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA and any implementing regulations. This portion of the Iowa
proposal is substantively similar to a former Federal provision that existed at 30 CFR 816/817.89(d). 

See

 (48 FR 43994, 44006) September 26, 1983. The Federal provision was suspended on November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952, 41962)
to implement the decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 

In re: Permanent Surface Min. Regulation Litigation, 

620 F. Supp. 1519, 1538 (D.D.C. 1985). The court remanded the rule because OSM failed to comply with the public notice
and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.   500-706, in promulgation
of the Federal provision.
OSM subsequently deleted 30 CFR 816/817.89(d) in the 

Federal Register 

notice dated December 17, 1991 (56 FR 65612, 65635-65636). As discussed in the December 17, 1991, 

Federal Register 

notice, in deleting the provision, OSM reasoned that Congress had assigned permitting, inspection, and enforcement
responsibilities under RCRA to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and that SMCRA did not require OSM or the
State regulatory authorities to assume such responsibilities. It was further reasoned that Congress would not appropriate
funds to OSM or State regulatory authorities for this task. With the deletion of this requirement, OSM stated that
it would continue ``consistent with its jurisdiction under the Act, to coordinate its regulatory program with EPA
to facilitate the implementation of RCRA regulations.'' However, OSM's action does not prohibit or prevent a State
regulatory authority from choosing to assume such responsibilities in coordination with EPA. Under section 505(b)
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental
controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provision
exists. Section 505(b) and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent
with the Federal program.
Because there is no Federal counterpart provision to the paragraph (c) of proposed IAC 27-40.63(12), OSM evaluated
Iowa's proposal based upon its consistency with section 515(b)(14) of SMCRA. Section 515(b)(14) of SMCRA generally
requires that all debris, acid-forming materials, toxic materials, or materials constituting a fire hazard, are
to be treated or buried and compacted or otherwise disposed of in a manner designed to prevent contamination of ground
or surface waters. Because Iowa's proposal here provides for the handling and disposal of ``hazardous'' noncoal
mine wastes in a manner designed to prevent contamination of ground or surface waters, i.e., pursuant to the provisions
of subtitle C of RCRA, the Director finds that Iowa's proposed provision at paragraph (c) of proposed IAC 27-40.63(12)
is not inconsistent with section 515(b)(14) of SMCRA and is approving the provision.
In summary, then, the Director finds that Iowa's proposed revisions at IAC 27-40.63(12) are consistent with
SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving them. The Director, by way of this notice, is requesting that Iowa
correct a typographical error in its rule in the phrase ``along with and other toxic wastes.'' The word ``and'' should
be corrected to read ``any.''




27. 

IAC 27-40.68, Special Permanent Program Performance Standards_In Situ Mining


Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.68, to delete the incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 828, dealing with performance
standards for in situ mining operations, and to reserve IAC 27-40.68. Therefore, in situ mining operations
are prohibited in Iowa and the State cannot approve any such operations since there are no rules to govern such operations.
In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion
to impose land use and environmental control and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that
are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11
dictate that such provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director
is approving the proposed revision at IAC 27-40.68.


28. IAC 27-40.71(4), State Regulatory Authority_Inspection and Enforcement, and 27-40.74(3), Civil
Penalties


Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.71(4) and IAC 27-40.74(3), to delete from its incorporation by reference
of 30 CFR 840.11(g)(3)(ii) and 845.15(b)(2) the phrase ``sections 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) or 521(c) of the Act''
and replace it with ``Iowa Code sections 207.15, 207.15, 207.14 and 207.14,'' respectively.
The proposed State substitute citations are not exact counterpart provisions to the provisions of SMCRA referenced
at 30 CFR 840.11(g)(3)(ii) and 845.15(b)(2).

Iowa, in a letter dated August 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA-389), proposed to editorially clarify
its program at IAC 27-40.71(4) by providing alternate State substitute citations that are the exact counterparts
to the Federal provisions cited at 30 CFR 840.11(g)(3)(ii). Therefore, the Federal Citations at sections 518(e),
518(f), 521(a)(4) and 521(c) of SMCRA are proposed to be replaced by Iowa Code subsections 207.15(6), 207.15(7),
207.14(3), and 207.14(8), respectively.

The Director finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.71(4) to be no less effective than the Federal counterpart
regulation and is approving it. However, the Director finds that the State proposal at IAC 27-40.74(3) is less
effective than its Federal counterpart provision. The Federal provision at 30 CFR 845.15(b)(2) refers to very specific
enforcement procedures that the regulatory authority should take under particular circumstances. In contrast,
the State proposal at IAC 27-40.74(3) merely refers to the statutory sections of the Iowa program dealing with
enforcement in general. Therefore, the Director is not approving the proposed revision at IAC 27-40.74(3).
Iowa is required to amend its program by providing the same specific editorial citation corrections at IAC 27-40.74(3)
as it did at IAC 27/40.71(4). 



29. IAC 27-40.74(207) and (8), Use of Civil Penalties for Reclamation 



Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.74(207), to incorporate 30 CFR Part 845 as in effect on July 1, 1992. This incorporation
by reference includes 30 CFR 845.21 which deals with the use of Federal funds collected from civil penalties by OSM
for reclamation. The Director recognizes that 30 CFR 845.21 deals with the disbursement of money collected by the
United States from the assessment of civil penalties and does not have application within the State program.

Iowa also proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27-40.74 by adding a paragraph (8) which provides as follows:




Use of civil penalties for reclamation. In accordance with Iowa Code section 207.10(6), the division may expend funds
collected from civil penalties to perform reclamation work on sites where the bond has been forfeited and additional
funds are needed to complete the reclamation of the site.




The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 845.21 address only how the Federal government is to allocate its funds. Therefore,
Iowa has discretion as to how it spends its monies collected from civil penalties.

Accordingly, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27-40.74(8) not to be inconsistent with the Federal
program and is approving it.



30. IAC 27-40.74(5)a., Procedures for Assessment Conference



Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.74(5)a. to revise its rule by changing the number of days that a person who was issued
a notice of assessment has to provide written request for an assessment conference to review the proposed assessment.
Iowa proposes to increase the timeframe from 15 days from the date the notice of assessment was mailed to 30 days from
the date the notice of assessment was mailed.

The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 845.18 allows the person to request an assessment conference within 30 days from the
date that the proposed assessment is received

. Since the number of days within which a person may request an assessment conference is a procedural matter, Iowa's
proposal must be evaluated from the point of view of its similarity to the Federal rules in affording rights and remedies
to persons. 

See

 (46 FR 53376) October 28, 1981.

The Director finds that the time difference between the date of mailing versus the date of receipt is minor enough to
be considered similar and, therefore, finds the proposed revision at IAC 27-40.74(5) to be no less effective
than the Federal regulation and is approving it.



31. IAC 27-40.75(207), Individual Civil Penalties 



Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.75(207), to incorporate by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 846
as in effect on July 1, 1992, dealing with individual civil penalties. Some exceptions to this incorporation by reference
are proposed and are discussed below.

a. 

Scope.

 Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.75(1), to delete from incorporation by reference, the Federal regulation at 30
CFR 846.1, Scope. This provision merely states that Part 846 covers assessment of individual civil penalties (ICP's)
under section 518(f) of the Act. It does not set out any separate substantive requirement relating to ICP's. The Director,
therefore, finds that the proposed revision at IAC 27-40.75(1) does not render Iowa's program less effective
than the Federal program and is approving it.

b. 

Violation, failure or refusal

. Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.75(2), to delete paragraphs (1) and (2) from the definition of ``violation, failure
or refusal'' at 30 CFR 846.5, and insert in lieu thereof, substitute paragraphs (1) and (2). Iowa's proposed language
is substantively similar to the deleted Federal language except that, where the Federal regulation provides the
specific statutory cite of section 518(b) of the Act as being excepted from failure or refusal to comply with orders,
Iowa substitutes a general reference to Iowa Code section 207.15.

As explained in the preamble to the final rule for 30 CFR 846.5 (53 FR 3664, 3666, February 8, 1988), the specific exception
for orders issued pursuant to section 518(b) of the Act in the definition of violation, failure or refusal is required
by section 518(f) of SMCRA:




Section 518(f) specifically prohibits the Secretary from assessing penalties for failure to comply with an order
incorporated in a civil penalty decision rendered under section 518(b), presumably because it would be counter-productive
to assess an individual civil penalty for the nonpayment of the original civil penalty assessed against the corporate
permittee.




Both section 518 of SMCRA and the State counterpart provision at Iowa Code section 207.15 cover more than just the original
civil penalty assessed against the corporate permittee. Accordingly, Iowa's proposal to completely exempt 

all

 orders issued under Iowa code section 207.15 is less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal rule
because section 518(f) exempts only one particular type of order issued under section 518. The Director is not approving
Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27-40.75(2) to the extent that Iowa's proposed rule provides for the exemption
of all orders issued under Iowa Code section 207.15.

c. 

Service

. Iowa proposes, at IAC 27-40.75(4), to delete from its incorporation by reference the Federal regulation at
30 CFR 846.17(c), dealing with service of civil penalty assessments, and insert in lieu thereof the following:




Service. For purposes of this section, service is sufficient if it would satisfy Division III of the Iowa rules of civil
procedure for service of an original notice and petition.




Iowa provided OSM with a copy of the service requirements from the Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure
for review (Administrative Record No. IA-383).

Upon review, the Director finds that the Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure for service of an original
notice and petition provision is the State counterpart provision to rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The Director notes that Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure, unlike 30 CFR 846.17(c), does not appear
to normally allow service to be performed on the individual to be assessed an individual civil penalty by certified
mail. Proposed State alternatives to procedural rules contained in the Federal regulations are evaluated ``from
the point of view of their similarity to the Secretary's rules in affording rights and remedies to persons'' (46 FR
53376, October 28, 1981). The Director finds that the State proposal affords additional procedural rights and remedies
to persons by not allowing service by certified mail. Accordingly, the Director finds that Division III of the Iowa
Rules of Civil Procedure is not inconsistent with the Federal program and is approving it. The Director also finds
that the IAC 27-40.75(4) incorporation of Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure does not render its
program less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 846.17(c) and is approving it as well.



IV. Public and Agency Comments



Public Comments



For a complete history of the opportunity provided for public comment on the proposed amendment, please refer to ``

Submission of Amendment.

No other agencies commented on the proposed amendment.



State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Comments (ACHP)



30 CFR 732.17(h)(4) requires that all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties be provided to the
SHPO and ACHP for comment. Comments were solicited from these offices. No comments were received from SHPO or ACHP.



V. Director's Decision



Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the proposed amendment submitted by Iowa on November 23, 1992,
and revised on July 21, 1993, with the exception of those provisions found to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal
regulations and identified in the codified portion of this notice under 30 CFR 915.16(b).

The Director is not approving certain provisions of the Iowa amendment for reasons set forth in Findings: no. 13b,
IAC 27-40.31(14), concerning willful suppressing or falsifying of facts in permit applications: no. 14a,
IAC 27-40.32(1), concerning guidelines for permit revisions and amendments; no. 22, IAC 27-40.51(7),
concerning bond release applications, no. 28, IAC 27-40.71(4), concerning enforcement procedures; and no.
31b, IAC 27-40.75(2), concerning the definition of violation, failure or refusal.

The Director is approving but requiring Iowa to further amend its regulations as discussed in Findings: no. 8, IAC
27-40.3(207), concerning petitions to initiate rulemaking; no. 9, IAC 27-40.4(9), concerning the definition
of ``previously mined area;'' and no. 23, IAC 27-40.63(207) and (2), concerning contemporaneous reclamation,
backfilling and grading time and distance requirements.

The Director is approving the Iowa proposed rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form
to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 915 codifying decisions concerning the Iowa program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency
of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

VI. Effect of Director's Decision


Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not excercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the oversight
of the Iowa program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by
OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives, and other materials, and will require the
enforcement by Iowa of only such provisions.


VII. Procedural Determinations


Compliance with Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


Compliance With Executive Order 12866


This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.


Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule is being published to terminate the offering of 2-Percent Depository Bonds and amend by removal Part
348 from Title 31 of the CFR, effective immediately.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No. 21-75, dated July 10, 1975, provides for the offering
and issuance of 2-Percent Depository Bonds.


Two Percent Depositary Bonds are acceptable to secure deposits of Federal funds with, and the faithful performance
of duties by, depositaries and financial agents, as designated in Part 348. The bonds have been offered to such depositaries
and financial agents in an amount not to exceed the amount of their qualification.
All outstanding 2-Percent Depositary Bonds have been redeemed by the Department of the Treasury. Depositaries and
financial agents are receiving payments for expenses incurred in handling Federal funds through arrangements not
involving 2-Percent Depositary Bonds. The offering of 2-Percent Depositary Bonds will terminate effective upon
publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

.
Because all outstanding 2-Percent Depositary Bonds have been redeemed, part 348, which governs these securities,
is unnecessary and, therefore, should be removed from title 31 of the CFR concurrent with termination of the offering.
Special Analysis: Because this amendment relates to the terms and conditions of special purpose Treasury securities,
the notice and public procedures, and the delayed effective date requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act
(5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)) are inapplicable. It has been determined that the rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory
action'' for purposes of Executive Order No. 12688. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

) do not apply to this rule.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans California State Implementation Plan Revision San Joaquin Valley
Unified Air Pollution Control District 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing the approval of a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on May 18, 1993. The revision concerns a rule from the following District: San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution
Control District (SJVUAPCD). This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The
intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance
with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rule controls VOC emissions
from non-assembly line motor vehicle and mobile equipment refinishing operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval
of this revision into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for
national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


On May 18, 1993 in 58 FR 28944, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SJVUAPCD's Rule 460.2,
Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Refinishing Operations. Rule 460.2 was adopted by SJVUAPCD on September 19, 1991.
The rule was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on January 28, 1992.
This rule was submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment
areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA
guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for
the above rule and nonattainment area is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) cited above. 
EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPR cited above.
EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provision and
evaluation has been provided in 58 FR 28944 and in the technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region IX
office
(Rule 460.2-TSD dated December 23, 1992).



Response to Public Comments


On March 22, 1993, EPA published a direct-final rulemaking notice in the 

Federal Register

 approving SJVUAPCD Rule 460.2, and one comment was received from the Flexible Packaging Association (FPA). Because
of that comment, EPA published a withdrawal of the direct-final notice on May 18, 1993 and on the same day proposed approval
of Rule 460.2 providing a 30-day public comment period (58 FR 28944)
The comment from the FPA has been evaluated by EPA and a summary of the comment and EPA's response is set forth below.


Comment

: The FPA commented that they believe capture efficiency (CE) test protocols which require the use of a temporary total
enclosure (TTE) are excessively expensive and not technically justified, compared to ``nonenclosed mass balance
tests''. FPA is currently running side by side comparison testing in cooperation with EPA. FPA believes that a requirement
to use the TTE method prior to an evaluation of this testing is premature.


Response

: EPA's interim policy on the implementation of CE protocols is to refrain from listing the lack of a CE test protocol
as a rule deficiency while EPA develops and reviews possible alternatives to CE test protocols which use a TTE. However,
EPA has continued to encourage states and local agencies to reference CE test protocols in their regulations where
appropriate and to use EPA's recommended method for measuring CE where noncompliance is suspected. State and local
agencies are free to include CE test protocol requirements in their regulations. 


EPA Action


EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rule for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal
under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D of the CAA. This approval action will
incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions
of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.



Regulatory Process


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table
3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by [Insert date 60 days from the date of publication]. Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce
its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Hazardous Waste Management System: Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste; Amendment




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is amending part 261, appendix IX to reflect changes in ownership
and name for the General Cable Company, Muncie, Indiana, and to delete exclusions that have been terminated. Exclusions
for the following facilities have been deleted: The Envirite Corporation, Thomaston, Connecticut; Pamcor C, Incorporated,
Las Piedras, Puerto Rico; Texas Instruments, Incorporated, Dallas, Texas; Tricil Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee;
Tricil Corporation, Hilliard, Ohio; Tricil Corporation, Muskegon, Michigan; and the William L. Bonnell Company,
Carthage, Tennessee. Today's amendment documents these changes.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In this document EPA is amending appendix IX to part 261 to reflect changes in the status of exclusions for certain facilities.
The petition process under   260.20 and 260.22 allows facilities to demonstrate that a specific waste
from a particular generating facility should not be regulated as a hazardous waste. Based on waste specific information
provided by petitioner, EPA granted exclusions to the following facilities: General Cable Company, Muncie, Indiana
(51 FR 37723, October 24, 1986); Envirite Corporation, Thomaston, Connecticut (51 FR 41323, November 14, 1986),
Pamcor C, Incorporated, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (51 FR 37019, October 17 1986); Texas Instruments, Incorporated,
Dallas, Texas (50 FR 34667, August 27, 1985); Tricil, Nashville, Tennessee (51 FR 41494, November 17, 1986); Tricil,
Hilliard, Ohio (51 FR 41494, November 17, 1986); Tricil, Muskegon, Michigan (51 FR 41494, November 17, 1986); William
Bonnell Company, Carthage, Tennessee (51 FR 37019, October 17, 1986).




On May 17, 1993, the Agency was notified that ownership of the General Cable Company, Muncie, Indiana, had been transferred
to Indiana Steel & Wire Corporation (IS&W). In this notification, IS&W noted that no changes had been
made in the management of EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. F006 and K062 excluded by the Agency and that all conditions of the
exclusion continue to be met. Today's notice documents this change by updating appendix IX to incorporate this change
in name.
EPA is also deleting seven exclusions from appendix IX because these facilities have notified EPA that they have permanently
changed their processes or otherwise ceased operations that generate the excluded waste. The specific facilities,
and the date on which generation of the excluded waste ceased, are given below. Envirite Corporation, Thomaston,
Connecticut, May 31, 1990; Pamcor C. Incorporated, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, October 1, 1992; Texas Instruments,
Incorporated, Dallas, Texas, December 22, 1988; Tricil, Nashville, Tennessee, January 1, 1990; Tricil, Hilliard,
Ohio, June 30, 1991; Tricil, Muskegon, Michigan, September 1, 1992; William Bonnell Company, Carthage, Tennessee,
August 7, 1991. All of the above generators have confirmed in writing that they no longer generate the delisted waste
at their facilities. On October 15, 1993, the Agency notified these facilities of the proposed action and solicited
their comments. No comments were received disputing the Agency's intended action. Therefore, this notice documents
this by deleting these exclusions from part 261, appendix IX. These facilities would need to submit new delisting
petitions if they wish to generate excluded waste at any time in the future.
These changes to appendix IX of part 261 are effective February 8, 1994. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of
1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than six-months when the regulated community
does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. As described above, all affected facilities have ceased
generation of the delisted waste. Therefore, a six-month delay in the effective date is not necessary in this case.
This provides a basis for making these amendments effective immediately upon publication under the Administrative
Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5531(d).

Suspension of Community Eligibility 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 

Federal Register

. 


In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column. 
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.



National Environmental Policy Act 


This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action. 


Regulatory Impact Analysis 


This rule is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, February 17, 1981, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp.,
p. 127. No regulatory impact analysis has been prepared. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October
26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 252. 


Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 


This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195,
3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 309.

Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year)
flood elevations for new buildings and their contents. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base flood elevation determinations are
available for inspection is provided. 


Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 
The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.

The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities. 
The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

action: 

Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 61 of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary
to prevent exceeding the interim specification for pollock in this area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.



The interim specification of pollock total allowable catch in Statistical Area 61 was established by interim specifications
(58 FR 60575, November 17, 1993) as 4,232 metric tons (mt), determined in accordance with  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A).

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 interim specification of pollock in Statistical Area 61 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 3,832 mt, and has set aside the remaining 400 mt as bycatch to support other
anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61, effective
from 12 noon, A.l.t., February 4, 1994, until superseded by the final 1994 specifications in the 

Federal Register

.

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  672.20(g).

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates critical habitat for the Mojave population of the desert
tortoise (

Gopherus agassizii

), a species federally listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Located primarily
on Federal land, and to a lesser extent on State, private, and Tribal lands, this critical habitat designation provides
additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. As
required by section 4 of the Act, the Service considered economic and other relevant impacts prior to making a final
decision on the size and configuration of critical habitat.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Mojave population of the desert tortoise, referred to herein as desert tortoise or tortoise, is one of three species
in the genus 

Gopherus 

found in the United States. The Berlandier's tortoise (

G. berlandieri

) is found in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas. The gopher tortoise (

G. polyphemus

) is found in the hot, humid portions of the southeastern United States. 

G. agassizii

 is relatively large, with adults measuring up to 15 inches in shell length, and inhabits the Mojave, Colorado, and
Sonoran Deserts in the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico. The species is divided into the Sonoran and
Mojave populations. The Sonoran population occurs south and east of the Colorado River in Arizona and Mexico, and
the Mojave population occupies those portions of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts north and west of the Colorado River
in southwestern Utah, northwestern Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California. 

For a thorough discussion of the ecology and life history of the desert tortoise, see the Draft Recovery Plan for the
Desert Tortoise (Mojave Population) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) and the April 2, 1990, final rule listing
the desert tortoise as a threatened species (55 FR 12178). These documents incorporate the majority of current biological
information on the desert tortoise used to develop this rule.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) requires the Service to designate critical habitat to the maximum
extent prudent and determinable concurrently with listing a species as endangered or threatened. On August 20, 1980,
the Service listed the Beaver Dam Slope population of the desert tortoise (

Gopherus agassizii

), in southwestern Utah, as a threatened species and designated 35 square miles of critical habitat (45 FR 55654).
On September 14, 1984, the Service received a petition from the Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense
Council, and Defenders of Wildlife to list the desert tortoise in Arizona, California, and Nevada as endangered.
In September 1985, the Service determined that the listing was warranted but precluded by other listing actions of
higher priority under authority of section 4(b)(3)(iii) of the Act (50 FR 49868). The Service made annual findings
of warranted but precluded from 1985 through 1989 under section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act. On May 31, 1989, the same three
environmental organizations provided substantial new information and petitioned the Service to list the desert
tortoise as endangered throughout its range in the United States under the expedited emergency provisions of the
Act. As a result of the new information, on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32326), the Service listed the Mojave population, excluding
the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah, as endangered by emergency rule. The Mojave population was designated in
the emergency rule as all tortoises occurring north and west of the Colorado River, in California, Nevada, Arizona,
and Utah. The Mojave population was then proposed under normal listing procedures on October 13, 1989 (54 FR 42270),
and listed as threatened on April 2, 1990 (55 FR 12178). 

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate
critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50
CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required
analyses of the impacts of the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently
well known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat. At the time of listing, the Service found that critical
habitat was not determinable because the specific size and spatial configuration of essential habitats, as well
as vital linkages connecting areas necessary for ensuring the conservation of the Mojave desert population throughout
its range, could not be determined without further information. 

On January 8, 1993, several plaintiffs filed a motion in 

Desert Tortoise et al.

 v. 

Lujan et al

., Civ. No. 93-0114 MHP (N.D. Cal.) seeking to stop the transfer of public land to the State of California for construction
of a low-level nuclear waste disposal facility in Ward Valley located in southern California. The plaintiffs contended
that the Service violated the Act by failing to designate critical habitat for the desert tortoise and sought an injunction
prohibiting transfer of the site until critical habitat was designated and a new section 7 biological opinion that
addressed the effects of the transfer on critical habitat was completed.

On January 27, 1993, the Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmental groups sued to compel designation
of critical habitat for the Mojave population of the desert tortoise, alleging that the Secretary had failed to meet
the designation deadline under section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act (

Natural Resources Defense Council

 v. 

Babbitt

, No. C-93-0301 MHP (N.D. Cal.)). Plaintiffs further requested the court to prohibit the Service from
issuing any further biological opinions for the tortoise under section 7 of the Act until critical habitat was designated.


On May 21, 1993, the plaintiffs, in both cases, and the Secretary agreed on a stipulation requiring the defendants
to propose critical habitat for the desert tortoise by August 1, 1993, and to designate critical habitat by December
1, 1993. On July 30, 1993, the plaintiffs agreed to an extension of these deadlines to August 29, 1993, for a proposal
and December 15, 1993, for a final decision. 

On March 30, 1993, the Service announced the availability of the Draft Recovery Plan for the Desert Tortoise (Mojave
Population) (Draft Recovery Plan) (58 FR 16691). The Draft Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) divides
the range of the desert tortoise into 6 recovery units and recommends establishment of 14 Desert Wildlife Management
Areas (DWMAs) within the recovery units. Within each DWMA, the Draft Recovery Plan recommends specific management
actions to effect recovery of desert tortoises. The public comment period on the Draft Recovery Plan closed on June
30, 1993. 

The Service published a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the desert tortoise on August 30, 1993 (58
FR 45748). The August 30 proposal requested comments from all interested parties on the proposed determination and
associated economic analysis. This final rule represents the Service's final decision on this issue. However, the
Service may revise critical habitat in the future if land management plans, recovery plans, or other conservation
strategies that are developed and fully implemented reduce the need for the additional protection provided by critical
habitat designation. 



Definition of Critical Habitat 



Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied
by the species * * * on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation
of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas
outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed * * * upon a determination
* * * that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,''
as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``* * * to use and the use of all methods and procedures which
are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant
to this Act are no longer necessary,'' i.e., the species is recovered and removed from the list of endangered and threatened
species. Section 3 further states that in most cases the entire range of a species should not be encompassed within
critical habitat. 



Role in Species Conservation 



Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should identify
lands that may be needed for a species' eventual recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat is designated
at the time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know exactly what may be needed for recovery. In this
regard, critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. 

The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to recovery, but is one of several measures available
to contribute to a species' conservation. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying
areas that contain essential habitat features (primary constituent elements) regardless of whether or not they
are currently occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the public to the importance of an area in the conservation
of a listed species. 
Critical habitat also identifies areas that may require special management or protection. Critical habitat receives
protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal agency.
The added protection of these areas may shorten the time needed to achieve recovery. Aside from the added protection
provided under section 7, the Act does not provide other forms of protection to lands designated as critical habitat.


Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan, it does not establish numerical population goals,
it does not prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside of critical habitat), nor does it have a direct
effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management recommendations for critical habitat are
more appropriately addressed in recovery plans, management plans, and section 7 consultations. 

In addition to considering biological information in designating critical habitat, the Service also considers
economic and other relevant impacts of designating critical habitat. The Service may exclude areas from critical
habitat when the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat,
provided that the exclusion will not result in the extinction of a species.

Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the conservation of a species. Areas not currently containing
all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may also be essential for the long-term
recovery of the species, particularly in certain portions of its range, and may be designated as critical habitat.
However, not all areas containing the features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to the species'
recovery. Areas not included in critical habitat that contain one or more of the essential elements are still important
to a species' conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act and other conservation laws and regulations.
All designated areas may also be of considerable value in maintaining ecosystem integrity and supporting other species,
although that is not a consideration in designating critical habitat. 

The process of designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise consisted of three steps that are explained in
this document. The first step was to determine the elements and areas essential to the tortoise's conservation. This
step was completed in the proposal process and is summarized in the sections of this rule entitled ``Primary Constituent
Elements'' and ``Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat.'' The second step was to determine the potential costs
of the proposed designation, which was completed in the proposal process and is summarized in this rule in the section
entitled ``Economic Summary of the August 30 Proposal.'' The final step was to consider whether any areas should be
excluded based upon economic and other relevant impacts and to determine the costs associated with the final designation.
This step is discussed in the sections entitled ``Summary of the Exclusion Process,'' ``Effects of the Designation,''
``Economic Impacts of the Final Designation,'' and ``Available Conservation Measures.'' A section on biodiversity
is included to highlight the importance of that issue and its relationship to the desert tortoise. 

Designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised, at any time, when new information indicates that
changes are warranted. The Service may revise critical habitat if land management plans, recovery plans, or other
conservation strategies are developed and fully implemented, reducing the need for the additional protection provided
by critical habitat designation. For example, after the Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan is finalized, land management
agencies may implement increased protection for the desert tortoise. If protection measures are implemented, the
Service may revise its critical habitat designation in the future. With increased protection, some components of
environmental variability threatening tortoise populations (or contributing to the variance of growth rates)
may be reduced, thus lessening the need for large populations. In such an event, a population viability analysis_considering
population trends based on the variance of population growth rates_might suggest that smaller, viable, populations
would require less habitat (i.e., smaller DWMAs and less need for critical habitat designation). Therefore, critical
habitat units (CHUs) could be decreased in size, increased in size, or eliminated based on changes in certain environmental
variables, in land status, or tortoise populations. 



Primary Constituent Elements 



In determining the areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological attributes
that are essential to a species' conservation. In addition, the Act stipulates that the areas containing these elements
may require special management considerations or protection. Such physical and biological features, as stated
in 50 CFR 424.12, include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; 
(2) Food, water, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; 
(3) Cover or shelter; 
(4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and 
(5) Generally, habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical
and ecological distributions of a species.

The Service is required to base critical habitat designations upon the best scientific and commercial data available
(50 CFR 424.12). In designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise, the Service has reviewed its overall approach
to the conservation of the desert tortoise undertaken since its emergency listing in 1989. In addition, the Service
reviewed all available information that pertains to habitat requirements of this species, including material received
during the public comment period from State and Federal agencies, other entities, and members of the public. 

Inherent difficulties in designating critical habitat for wide-ranging threatened species, such as the desert
tortoise, make it unlikely that all habitat within the range of the species would be included in the designation. In
fact, section 3(5)(C) of the Act states that, in most cases, critical habitat should not encompass the entire range
of the species. Based upon the parameters discussed below, the Service determined the appropriateness of including
specific areas. 



Habitat Characteristics 



The Service has determined that the physical and biological habitat features (referred to as the primary constituent
elements) that support nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow are essential to the conservation
of the desert tortoise. These elements were determined from studies on desert tortoise habitat preferences (e.g.,
habitat structure and use, forage requirements) throughout the range of the species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
1993). Desert tortoise habitat consists of the following primary constituent elements: Sufficient space to support
viable populations within each of the six recovery units and provide for movements, dispersal, and gene flow; sufficient
quantity and quality of forage species and the proper soil conditions to provide for the growth of such species; suitable
substrates for burrowing, nesting, and overwintering; burrows, caliche caves, and other shelter sites; sufficient
vegetation for shelter from temperature extremes and predators; and habitat protected from disturbance and human-caused
mortality. 

Designated critical habitat for the desert tortoise encompasses portions of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts that
contain the primary constituent elements and focuses on areas that are essential to the species' recovery. The CHU
boundaries are based on proposed DWMAs in the Draft Recovery Plan. Because the boundaries were drawn to conform with
accepted principles of conservation biology (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993), the areas may contain both ``suitable''
and ``unsuitable'' habitat. The term ``suitable'' generally refers to habitat that provides the constituent elements
of nesting, sheltering, foraging, dispersal, and/or gene flow. 



Ecological Considerations 



The range of the Mojave population of the desert tortoise includes portions of the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert
division of the Sonoran Desert (Colorado Desert) and spans portions of four States. The Mojave Desert is located in
southern California, southern Nevada, northwestern Arizona, and southwestern Utah. It is bordered on the north
by the Great Basin Desert, on the west by the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi ranges, on the south by the San Gabriel and San
Bernardino Mountains and the Colorado Desert, and on the east by the Grand Wash Cliffs and Hualapai Mountains of Arizona.
This area includes parts of Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties in California; the northwestern
part of Mohave County in Arizona; Clark County, and the southern parts of Esmeralda, Nye, and Lincoln Counties in Nevada;
and part of Washington County in Utah. The Colorado Desert is located south of the Mojave Desert, east of California's
Peninsular Ranges, and west of the Colorado River. This area includes Imperial County and parts of San Bernardino
and Riverside Counties, California. 

The desert tortoise is most commonly found within the desert scrub vegetation type, primarily in creosote bush scrub
vegetation, but also in succulent scrub, cheesebush scrub, blackbush scrub, hopsage scrub, shadscale scrub, microphyll
woodland, and Mojave saltbush-allscale scrub. Within the desert microphyll woodland, the desert tortoise occurs
in blue palo verde-ironwood-smoke tree woodland. The desert tortoise also occurs in scrub-steppe vegetation types
of the desert and semidesert grassland complex (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). 

Within these vegetation types, desert tortoises potentially can survive and reproduce where their basic habitat
requirements are met. These requirements include a sufficient amount and quality of forage species; shelter sites
for protection from predators and environmental extremes; suitable substrates for burrowing, nesting, and overwintering;
various plants for shelter; and adequate area for movement, dispersal, and gene flow. Throughout most of the Mojave
Region, tortoises occur most commonly on gently sloping terrain with soils ranging from sand to sandy-gravel and
with scattered shrubs, and where there is abundant inter-shrub space for growth of herbaceous plants. Throughout
their range, however, tortoises can be found in steeper, rockier areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). 

The size of desert tortoise home ranges varies with respect to location and year. Females have long-term home ranges
that are approximately half that of the average male, which range from 10 to 80 hectares (Berry 1986).

Although desert tortoise populations are not generally known to inhabit elevations much above 4,000 feet, tortoise
burrows have been located at 4,800 feet in the Providence and Clark Mountains of the eastern Mojave (Luckenbach 1982;
W. Yumiko, pers. comm., 1992). Reliable sources have recorded desert tortoises at 7,300 feet in Death Valley National
Monument, California (Luckenbach 1982); at 4,800 feet in the Goodsprings Mountains (R. Marlow, pers. comm.) and
the Spring Range, Nevada (C. Stevenson, pers. comm.); at 5,000 feet in the East Pahranagat Range, Nevada (C. Stevenson,
pers. comm.); and at 5,200 feet on the Nevada Test Site (B. Burge, pers. comm.). In addition, numerous anecdotal reports
place desert tortoises as high as 7,000 feet on Mount Charleston, Nevada, and in the Clark Mountains, California.
Fossil remains from the Pleistocene to late Holocene (12,000 to 1,000 years before present) indicate the preferred
habitat of the desert tortoise included elevations far exceeding those of today, perhaps in response to arid climatic
episodes that occurred during this epoch (Morafka and Brussard, in prep.; Schneider and Everson 1989). This fossil
evidence indicates that the species may have spent less than 10 percent of its taxonomic life span in the contemporary
warm creosote bush desert, the remainder having been spent in more mesic, equable, and productive climates and ecosystems.
This implies that contemporary tortoise populations in most of the Mojave region are likely to be vulnerable to adverse
climatic conditions and to regional climate change (Morafka and Brussard, in prep.).

Throughout its geographic distribution, the desert tortoise exhibits trait variations in behavior, ecology, genetics,
morphology, and physiology (Weinstein and Berry 1988, Germano 1989, Lamb 

et al.

 1989, Brussard 1992, Brussard and Britten 1992). For example, three basic shell shapes (phenotypes) are indicative
of desert tortoise populations in distinct geographic areas within their range (Weinstein and Berry 1988). Tortoises
occurring in California and southern Nevada exhibit a boxlike, high-domed shell phenotype; Beaver Dam Slope tortoises
have a short plastron (underside) and a low-domed shell phenotype; and Sonoran Desert tortoises have a pear-shaped,
low-domed shell phenotype (Weinstein and Berry 1988). Furthermore, identification of the three phenotypes parallels
results of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies that also ``type'' desert tortoises into the same three populations
based on genetics (Lamb 

et al.

 1989). It is because of such variability that six recovery units representing six distinct population segments of
the Mojave population have been proposed in the Draft Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). These population
segments should not be confused with subspecies or recognized populations, e.g., the Mojave or Sonoran populations.
The six recovery units within the range of the desert tortoise, as outlined in the Draft Recovery Plan, mirror the biotic
and abiotic variability found in the desert tortoise habitat.

The objective of the Draft Recovery Plan is the recovery and delisting of the Mojave population of the desert tortoise.
Desert tortoise populations have declined substantially throughout the Mojave Region in the last 2 decades, primarily
due to habitat loss. These populations grow slowly, and significant improvement in the status of the Mojave population
will be a very long process, measured in decades or centuries in most parts of the Mojave Region. Nevertheless, delisting
of the desert tortoise may be considered if the following criteria are met:

(1) As determined by a scientifically credible monitoring plan, the population within a recovery unit exhibits a
statistically significant upward trend toward target density or remains stationary at target density for at least
12 years (one-half of a desert tortoise generation);

(2) Enough habitat is protected within a recovery unit and/or the habitat and desert tortoise populations are managed
intensively enough to ensure long-term population viability;

(3) Regulatory mechanisms or land management commitments have been implemented that provide for adequate long-term
protection of desert tortoises and their habitat; and

(4) The population is unlikely to need protection under the Act in the foreseeable future.

Even though the Draft Recovery Plan has not been approved, it represents the best available biological information
on the conditions needed to bring the Mojave population of the desert tortoise to the point where listing under the
Act is no longer necessary (i.e., recovery).

The Service would delist the Mojave population of the desert tortoise if the delisting criteria were met because protection
under the Act would be unnecessary. With the delisting criteria met, the desert tortoise and its habitat would continue
to be protected under other regulatory mechanisms outlined in a final recovery plan. Upon delisting, the interim
protection afforded by the Act in the designation of critical habitat would be eliminated.



Management Considerations



Current and historic desert tortoise habitat loss, deterioration, and fragmentation is largely attributable to
urban development, military operations, and multiple-uses of public land, such as off-highway vehicle (OHV) activities
and livestock grazing. Historically, habitat reduction and fragmentation have not been uniform throughout the
desert tortoise's range, but have been concentrated around populated areas, such as Mohave, Boron, Kramer Junction,
Barstow, Victorville, Apple Valley, Lucerne Valley, and Twentynine Palms, California. Similar patterns are evident
near Las Vegas, Laughlin, and Mesquite, Nevada; and St. George, Utah.

Human ``predation'' (taking desert tortoises out of their natural populations either by death (accidental or intentional)
or by removal) is also a major factor in the decline of the desert tortoise. People illegally collect desert tortoises
for pets, food, and commercial trade. Some immigrants to the United States have collected desert tortoises for medicinal
or other cultural purposes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993).

Desert tortoises are often struck and killed by vehicles on roads and highways, and mortality of desert tortoises
due to gunshot and OHV activities is common in many parts of the Mojave Region, particularly near cities and towns.
In the western Mojave Desert of California, 14.3 percent of the carcasses found on 11 permanent study plots showed
evidence of gunshot (Sievers 

et al.

 1988). At one plot, 28 percent of the carcasses had evidence of gunshot. Loss of tortoises from vandalism has also been
reported in northwestern Arizona. Approximately 10 percent of shell remains from a tortoise study plot near Littlefield,
Arizona, had gunshot wounds.

OHV use in the desert has increased and proliferated since the 1960s (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). As of 1980,
OHV activities affected approximately 25 percent of all desert tortoise habitat in California, as well as substantial
portions in southern Nevada (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Negative effects range from minor habitat alteration
to total denudation of extensive areas. While direct effects are immediate (mortality from crushing, collection,
and vandalism), indirect effects can be either immediate (disruption of soil integrity; degradation of annual plants,
grasses, and perennial plants; and/or destruction of desert tortoise shelter sites), delayed, and/or cumulative
(soil loss due to erosion, soil compaction and its effects on annual and perennial plants, water pollution, and litter
and refuse) (Biosystems Analysis 1991).

Impacts of roads within desert tortoise habitat extend significantly beyond the tracks that are created. Fewer tortoise
signs are found closer to roads, suggesting reduced populations (Nicholson 1978). Thus, well-used OHV areas often
result in depressed tortoise populations extending beyond the immediate boundaries of the directly disturbed habitat.

The use of OHVs appears to have a significant effect on tortoise abundance and distribution. Although road closures
have been implemented in some areas, illegal vehicle route proliferation has also occurred in many areas and can result
in a significant cumulative loss of habitat. Human access increases the incidence of tortoise mortality from collecting,
gunshot, and crushing by vehicles.

Domestic livestock grazing has occurred in desert tortoise habitat since the mid-1800s, with an increase in intensity
near the turn of the century to the mid-1930s (Biosystems Analysis 1991). Possible direct impacts from grazing include
trampling of both tortoises and shelter sites; possible indirect impacts include loss of plant cover, reduction
in number of suitable shelter sites, change in vegetation, compaction of soils, reduced water infiltration, erosion,
inhibition of nitrogen fixation in desert plants, and the provision of a favorable seed bed for exotic annual vegetation
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1991, 1993). Habitat destruction and degradation are especially evident in livestock
watering, bedding, loading, and unloading areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1991).

The degree and nature of impacts from livestock grazing are dependent upon the local ecosystem, grazing history,
seasons of use, stocking rates, annual rainfall, and density of the tortoise population. Desert ecosystems require
decades to recover from disturbances, and desert tortoise populations are incapable of rapid growth, even under
optimum conditions.

Desert tortoises, particularly hatchlings and juveniles, are preyed upon by several native species of mammals,
reptiles, and birds. Domestic and feral dogs are a new source of mortality.

Common raven (

Corvus corax

) populations in the southwestern deserts have increased significantly since the 1940s, presumably in response
to expanding human use of the desert. Sewage ponds, landfills (authorized and unauthorized), power lines, roads,
and other human uses have increased available foraging, roosting, and nesting opportunities for ravens. Over the
last 20 years, raven populations in the western Mojave Desert have increased 1528 percent between 1968 and 1988 (about
15 percent per year) and increased in the Colorado-Sonoran Deserts 474 percent (over 9 percent per year). While not
all ravens may include tortoises as significant components of their diets, these birds are highly opportunistic
in their feeding patterns and concentrate on easily available seasonal food sources, such as juvenile tortoises.
Increased mortality of young desert tortoises (in part due to predation by ravens), combined with drastically lowered
survivorship of adults, is likely responsible for observed catastrophic population declines (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1993).

An upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) is prevalent in captive desert tortoises and has been identified in wild
desert tortoises in many localities in the western Mojave Desert and in limited localities elsewhere. URTD appears
to be spreading and may have been introduced to wild populations through illegal releases of diseased captive desert
tortoises. Wild desert tortoises with signs of URTD are commonly found near cities and towns with concentrations
of captive desert tortoises (Marlow and Brussard 1993). Disease has contributed to high mortality rates in the western
Mojave Desert in the last 4 years (Avery and Berry 1990, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). 
Recent studies have demonstrated 

Mycoplasma agassizii 

sp. nov. as the causative agent of URTD. Predisposing factors, such as habitat degradation, poor nutrition, and drought,
are likely involved in increasing the susceptibility of individual animals to disease (Jacobson 

et al. 

1991). Drought and concomitant poor nutrition have the potential to compromise desert tortoises immunologically
and, therefore, make them more susceptible to URTD and other diseases. Controlling human-related spread of URTD,
improving habitat conditions, and monitoring health status of desert tortoise populations are some of the more important
management tools that can be used in controlling URTD in wild populations of the desert tortoise (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1993). 
A shell disease has also been observed in the Chuckwalla Bench population in the eastern Colorado Desert (Jacobson


et al.

 1992). A variety of mineral and metal deficiencies, as well as various toxicants, are known to cause integumentary
pathology in mammals, suggesting disease or toxicosis may be responsible for these observed shell abnormalities
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Another shell disease, osteopenia, occurs in desert tortoise populations
on the Beaver Dam Slope and may be related to poor nutrition (Jarchow and May 1989). 


Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat 


The maintenance of stable, self-sustaining, and well-distributed populations of desert tortoises throughout
their range is dependent upon habitat quality and its ability to support viable populations. The biological and physical
characteristics of the desert ecosystem that support nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow
are essential for this purpose. The Service based its designation of critical habitat on those areas recommended
for recovery of the desert tortoise in the Draft Recovery Plan. 
The Draft Recovery Plan proposes 14 DWMAs within 6 recovery units within the range of the desert tortoise. The Service
used the DWMAs as the basis for CHUs because: 
(1) The Draft Recovery Plan's conservation strategy is based upon the best available information on desert tortoises
gathered and analyzed over the past 20 years; 
(2) The Draft Recovery Plan represents an in-depth analysis of the conservation needs of the desert tortoise; 
(3) The areas recommended as DWMAs were proposed by experts familiar with the species and its habitat based on the principles
of conservation biology; and 
(4) Use of the DWMAs is consistent with the Service's other conservation efforts (e.g., it has been the focus in section
7 consultations and conservation planning). 
The Service's identification of areas consistent with the proposed DWMAs containing the primary constituent elements
described above was based on the seven principles of conservation biology used in the Draft Recovery Plan: 
(1) Reserves should be well-distributed across a species' native range; 
(2) Reserves should contain large blocks of habitat with large populations of the target species; 
(3) Blocks of habitat should be close together; 
(4) Reserves should contain contiguous rather than fragmented habitat; 
(5) Habitat patches should contain minimal edge to area ratios; 
(6) Blocks should be interconnected by corridors or linkages containing protected, preferred habitat for the target
species; and 
(7) Blocks of habitat should be roadless or otherwise inaccessible to humans. 
Critical habitat is based on the framework of the Draft Recovery Plan. Should a final approved recovery plan vary significantly
from the draft, or significantly change the assumptions underlying this critical habitat designation, then the
Service may reevaluate critical habitat boundaries.

Differences From the Draft Recovery Plan 


Designation of critical habitat does not accomplish the same goals or have as dramatic an effect upon tortoise conservation
as does a recovery plan because critical habitat does not apply a management prescription to designated areas. Because
critical habitat designation is not a management plan, there was not a limitation on the size of the areas designated,
although the designation is consistent with recommendations of the Draft Recovery Plan. 


Adjustments to Legally Described Boundaries 


The regulations require that the Service define ``* * * by specific limits using reference points
and lines as found on standard topographic maps'' those areas designated as critical habitat (50 CFR 424.12 (c)).
After selecting DWMAs as the starting point, the Service made several types of adjustments. To facilitate legal definition,
CHU boundaries were adjusted to adjacent section lines, depending upon the amount and quality of habitat within the
adjacent sections. The boundaries generally follow the 4,100-foot elevation contour line, except where excluding
higher elevations would compromise reserve design principles. When adjacent to cities or towns, critical habitat
boundaries were drawn on 1/2 or 1/4 section lines to remove as much unsuitable habitat as possible. 

In addition to adjusting DWMA boundaries to meet the requirements to define critical habitat boundaries, the Service
made other changes. Some CHUs represent more precisely described desert tortoise habitat within the DWMA boundary,
and thus, encompass a much smaller area. For example, portions of DWMAs were not included in critical habitat if unsuitable
habitat was identifiable on available maps and the exclusion would not affect the size or configuration recommendations
made by the Draft Recovery Plan. Conversely, some critical habitat boundaries were expanded beyond DWMA boundaries
to include additional habitat based on information made available to the Service during preparation of the rule.

In addressing the above factors, the Service considered existing suitable habitat and desert tortoise populations
that were not included in existing DWMAs and areas where additional protection should be considered to reduce the
risk to recovery. When including other areas, the Service considered factors similar to those outlined in the Draft
Recovery Plan on contiguity, shape, habitat quality, and spacing. Areas with minimal fragmentation were selected
over areas with more extensive fragmentation. 
The desert tortoise requires large, contiguous areas of habitat to meet its life requisites. Human activities have
reduced much of the habitat in some areas to small, fragmented, and isolated areas that are not expected to support
viable populations over time. In some cases, those areas were designated as critical habitat when they were needed
to promote future development of large contiguous habitat areas in the future. 


Lands Outside of Critical Habitat 


Not all suitable desert tortoise habitat was included in critical habitat. The Service recognizes the importance
of all lands, but did not incorporate all habitat within CHUs, primarily because most of these lands did not meet the
designation criteria (i.e., were not associated with an area recommended in the Draft Recovery Plan, were too small
to maintain a stable population of tortoises over time, or were already protected). This does not mean that lands outside
of critical habitat do not play an important role in the tortoise's conservation. These lands are also important to
providing nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow habitat for tortoises. 


Previously Protected Areas 


The current management policies of the Desert National Wildlife Range, Joshua Tree National Monument, and the Desert
Tortoise Natural Area provide adequate protection against potential habitat-altering activities because they
are primarily managed as natural ecosystems. The Service considered their relative contribution to the tortoise's
conservation but did not include them in critical habitat because of their current classification. These lands are
essential to the conservation of the species because they provide important links and contain large areas of contiguous
habitat. 
By themselves, these previously protected areas are not large enough and do not contain sufficient population levels
to support viable populations. They will be considered in developing recovery areas for the desert tortoise, in addition
to surrounding public lands with desert tortoise habitat. 


Management Planning 


The Service's intent in designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise is to provide protection for habitat
that contains constituent habitat elements in sufficient quantities and quality to maintain a stable population
of desert tortoises throughout their range. The emphasis for future management will be on maintaining or developing
habitat that has the characteristics of suitable tortoise habitat and to avoid or reduce the adverse effects of current
management practices. 
Although critical habitat is not a management plan, the areas selected for inclusion play a role in maintaining a stable
and well-distributed population of tortoises. Identification of these areas concluded the first step in the designation
of critical habitat for the desert tortoise. 


Economic Summary of August 30 Proposal 


Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data
available and to consider the economic effects and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical
habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusions
outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the
best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such areas as critical habitat will
result in the extinction of the species concerned. 
The economic effects of designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise are the incremental impacts over and
above those impacts that occurred as a result of implementation of management plans, such as Federal land management
plans, habitat conservation plans that have already been implemented, and previous events, including the listing
of the desert tortoise. The economic analysis considers the critical habitat impacts to be those incremental impacts
that are expected as a result of the critical habitat.

The Service analyzed the economic effects of the August 30, 1993, proposal to designate critical habitat (Schamberger


et al.

 1993). A summary of that analysis was provided in the proposed rule (58 FR 45748). That analysis examined how designation
of critical habitat was expected to affect the use of Federal lands or State or private activities with some Federal
involvement, and the economic costs or benefits that would ensue in the four-State area. These were the regional economic
effects of the designation that were over and above those expected to result from previous actions, including the
listing of the desert tortoise as threatened. The economic analysis assumed those values that were in place prior
to critical habitat (e.g., final Bureau of Land Management (BLM) plans, section 7 jeopardy standard, the Clark County
short-term habitat conservation plan, and section 9 prohibitions) as the baseline for this analysis. As a result,
critical habitat effects were those incremental impacts that would occur solely as a result of the critical habitat
proposal above and beyond the effects of these other actions.

The critical habitat covers a broad geographic area in four States and includes Federal, State, private, and Tribal
lands. Because the designation affects only Federal agency actions under section 7, it is assumed that any ensuing
economic impacts of the designation would occur only on Federal lands or on non-Federal lands where there is Federal
involvement. The Service concluded that the impacts on Federal lands would be largely limited to livestock grazing,
mining, and recreational activities that may affect tortoise habitat.

As a result of that analysis, the Service concluded that the August 30 proposal would affect 51 Federal grazing permits
that provide about 59,500 animal unit months (AUMs). The maximum potential reduction in regional employment was
estimated to be 425 jobs (340 direct jobs; 85 indirect jobs). The profitability of ranches in the seven counties is
estimated to fall by $4,470,000 due to critical habitat designation. That is the estimated permanent decrease in
ranch profits, capitalized at 10 percent for a 50-year period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice 

et al.

 (1978). Reduced grazing fees in the seven-county region from Federal allotments was estimated to total $170,000
annually. Half of this amount ($85,000) was returned to the grazing programs for range improvements, the U.S. Treasury
received a maximum 37.5 percent ($63,750) of the fees, and local governments received a minimum of 12.5 percent ($21,250).
The effect of reduced grazing on Federal land is expected to vary among counties. The designation of critical habitat
is not expected to have significant economic effects within any of the seven counties.

Designation of critical habitat will not affect ongoing mining operations, as the ground disturbances typical of
mineral extraction make mine sites unsuitable for tortoise habitat. Expansion of existing mines or development
of new mines will require section 7 consultation with the Service. Most of the CHUs include surface areas on which mining
claims have been filed. The economic impact of critical habitat designation cannot be determined at the present time
due to the uncertainty of economically feasible mineral extraction. Mining claims allow exploration but do not assure
exercise of exploration rights, nor do they ensure economic profits to the owner.

The Service was unable to identify significant economic impacts to recreation activities due to critical habitat
designation.

Conservation of the desert tortoise and its habitat through designation of critical habitat will result in a wide
range of benefits, including recreation values, watershed protection, and others, as well as the values that society
places on conservation of the tortoise and its ecosystem. However, it was not possible to place dollar estimates on
these values.

As a result of this analysis, the Service concluded that the economic impacts that would be incurred from critical
habitat designation would not be significant to either the regional (seven-county) or national economy. The Service
did not recommend any exclusions based on economic effects.

Summary of the Exclusion Process



To determine whether or not to exclude areas from the designation of critical habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2)
of the Act requires determinations of:

(1) The benefits of excluding an area as critical habitat,

(2) The benefits of including an area, and

(3) The effects of exclusions on the probability of species extinction.

This process consists of estimating the benefits of retaining or excluding CHUs, weighing those benefits, and determining
if exclusion of an area or areas will lead to the extinction of the species. If the exclusion of an area or areas from critical
habitat will result in eventual species extinction, then the exclusion would be prohibited under the Act.



Extinction



Critical habitat consists of areas with habitat characteristics that are essential to the conservation of a listed
species. However, the exclusion process focuses upon a threshold for species extinction. Conservation (recovery)
and extinction are separate standards. Recovery and extinction are at opposite ends of a continuum, with the likelihood
of a species' continued survival increasing the closer the species is to the recovery end of the continuum. It may be
more difficult to predict the point at which extinction would be inevitable than to determine where recovery may occur.

Each such determination may be different for different species and may vary over the range of a species. It may be related
to a number of factors, such as the number of individuals, amount of habitat, condition of the habitat, and reproductive
success. Extinction of a wide-ranging species such as the desert tortoise would most likely occur as a result of increased
fragmentation of its habitat (affecting quality). Portions of the species' range would no longer support tortoises
before the species would become extinct. Cumulatively, reductions in range would inevitably lead to the species'
extinction. The focus of the analysis was on those factors that pertain to these issues and included consideration
of the condition and location of habitat.



Criteria and Decision



The Act specifically prohibits consideration of economic effects when listing species as threatened or endangered,
but requires an analysis of the economic and other relevant impacts of designating critical habitat. Therefore,
economic costs and benefits of critical habitat designation were defined as the economic effects that:

(1) Exceed those that resulted from listing the desert tortoise as a threatened species in April 1990; and

(2) Are above those economic effects resulting from the previous implementation of tortoise protection measures
by Federal land management agencies.

In evaluating the designation of critical habitat to determine whether or not to exclude areas because of concerns
over economic effects, the Service used the following process:

(1) Areas were identified that are essential to the conservation of the species based upon the criteria described
in this document; and

(2) An economic analysis was conducted to ascertain the anticipated economic consequences of designating areas
as critical habitat, using the county as the basic level of economic analysis.



Exclusion



After considering the economic and other factors that may be pertinent to any decision to exclude areas from designation
as critical habitat, the Secretary of the Interior has determined that no exclusions are appropriate.



Biological Modifications to Boundaries



Based on information received during the proposal process, the Service refined boundaries of six CHUs based on biological
information that these areas did not contain constituent elements and that deletion of them from critical habitat
would not compromise the function of the CHU or its reserve design. These areas included:

(1) Approximately 2,000 acres in the Chocolate Mountains in the Chuckwalla CHU in California;

(2) Approximately 20,800 acres within and adjacent to the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base in the Ord-Rodman CHU
in California;

(3) Approximately 13,200 acres in the Newberry Mountains in the Piute-Eldorado CHU in Nevada;

(4) Approximately 76,300 acres on both the northern and southern borders of the Mormon Mesa CHU in Nevada;

(5) Approximately 80,757 acres around the Gold Butte-Pakoon CHU in Arizona; and

(6) Approximately 8,100 acres north of St. George, Utah in the Upper Virgin River CHU in Utah.

In addition, based on information and a request submitted from the BLM, the Service included an additional 1,920 acres
on the southern border of the Beaver Dam Slope CHU in Arizona. This request was accommodated because:

(1) It was made by the landowner and will not affect other landowners, 

(2) The proposed inclusion constitutes an insignificant change from the proposed rule, and 

(3) It will allow the BLM's desert tortoise study plots to be included within desert tortoise habitat. 



Effects of the Designation 



The proposed rule for the designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise published on August 30, 1993, identified
12 areas encompassing a total of approximately 6.6 million acres. It included eight CHUs totaling 4.8 million acres
in California, four CHUs totaling 1.3 million acres in Nevada, two CHUs totalling 137,200 acres in Utah, and two CHUs
totaling 417,400 acres in Arizona. This included 5 million acres of BLM land, 247,400 acres of military lands, 151,200
acres of National Park Service land, 170,100 acres of State lands, 1,600 acres of Tribal lands, 1,079,500 acres of
private lands, and 100 acres of Forest Service land. A summary of changes in acreage between the proposed rule and this
final rule are provided in Table 1.

Total Acres Included in Critical Habitat 



As a result of boundary revisions based on new biological information, the Service is designating approximately
199,100 acres less than proposed in the August 30, 1993 proposal. The final rule for the designation of critical habitat
for the desert tortoise identifies 12 areas, encompassing a total of 6.4 million acres. The Service has designated
eight units totaling 4.8 million acres in California, four units totaling 1.2 million acres in Nevada, two units totaling
129,100 acres in Utah, and two units totaling 338,700 acres in Arizona. The final designation encompasses approximately
4,790,600 acres of BLM land, 242,200 acres of military land, 147,200 acres of National Park Service land, 166,200
acres of State land, 1,600 acres of Tribal land, and 1,098,400 acres of private land (see Tables 2 and 3). Three CHU boundaries
span more than one State_Piute-Eldorado (California and Nevada), Gold Butte-Pakoon (Nevada and Arizona), and Beaver
Dam Slope (Nevada, Arizona, and Utah).

Developed areas, such as towns, airports, and roads, and dry lakes, active mining operations, and water bodies will
not be affected by the designation because they will never contain primary constituent elements. To the extent possible,
these areas were deleted from critical habitat. If these areas were found along the periphery of CHUs, boundaries
were redrawn to physically exclude them from the final maps. This was not possible for areas imbedded within individual
units. Acreage totals were adjusted where possible to reflect their exclusion. 
The majority of desert tortoises and suitable desert tortoise habitat (i.e., for nesting, sheltering, foraging,
dispersal, and gene flow) are found on BLM land. Much of the private land included in the critical habitat boundaries
results from checkerboard landownership patterns along railroads. The final designation of critical habitat includes
the areas that contain the best remaining desert tortoise habitat. 


Economic Impacts of the Final Designation 


The economic analysis (Schamberger 

et al.

 1993) provides the Service's conclusions on the potential impacts of the areas selected for final designation as
critical habitat. This analysis served as a decision document in evaluating economic consequences of the action
leading to the final decision to designate critical habitat. 
Consistent with the requirements of section 4 of the Act, the economic analysis reviews the final economic impact
of designating critical habitat. Only these incremental costs and benefits of designation may be considered in determining
whether to exclude lands from designation. The economic analysis examined the costs and benefits of precluding or
limiting specific land uses within portions of critical habitat beyond those restrictions that have already been
implemented either for the benefit of the desert tortoise through the listing process or for some other reason. Incremental
analysis was the appropriate method to use because the designation of critical habitat is the only action for which
the Service now has decision authority. The economic costs of listing the species have already been incurred, and
the economic effects of actions taken by other Federal or State agencies are outside the purview of the Service. The
analysis was cast in a ``with'' critical habitat versus a ``without'' critical habitat framework and measures the
net change in various categories of benefits and costs when the critical habitat designation was imposed on the existing
baseline. The analysis evaluated national economic, or efficiency, costs and benefits that reflect changes in social
welfare. The standard measure of those costs and benefits is economic surplus in the form of economic rents and consumer
surplus. 
The costs of designating an area as critical habitat are the net economic costs of precluding or restricting certain
land uses over the period of analysis. Costs are measured as the difference between the resource's value in its economically
best use without critical habitat and its next best use (opportunity cost) when that use is precluded or restricted
by critical habitat. Economic effects include a mixture of efficiency and equity measures. 
The economic efficiency effects of designation include those that result in changes in social welfare. Regional
economic impacts often represent transfers among people, groups, and/or geographic regions. For simplicity, economic
efficiency effects are referred to as benefits and costs, and distributional effects are cited as economic impacts.
National economic efficiency effects may include, but are not restricted to: 
(1) Net change in aggregate value of capital (e.g., lands) due to critical habitat designation; 
(2) Wage earnings foregone from a significant number of employees permanently displaced through critical habitat
designation; 
(3) Opportunity costs of foregone or precluded economic activities (e.g., curtailed or terminated land development);
and 
(4) Benefits of retaining genetic and biological diversity through specific species protection measures. 
Regional (distributional) economic impacts may include: 
(1) Changes in specific county tax revenues due to changes in land use (e.g., developed real estate versus raw, undeveloped
land); and 
(2) Regional social costs and benefits from factors such as transient unemployment, job training, or redistribution
of existing job-mix categories (e.g., transitioning from underemployment in seasonal range or mine work to full
employment in other sectors). 
The analysis of effects of critical habitat designation combines national economic efficiency effects and regional
(distributional) impacts. These include effects on the net returns of local ranch operations, foregone grazing
fees, compensation to allottees for permanent improvements to land leased from the Federal government for grazing,
changes in total employment, and the portion of grazing fees that would be shared with local governments. 
These consequences are presented in the context of size, relative to the value added, of the seven counties in which
the grazing impacts would be realized. These consequences illustrate the relative magnitude of critical habitat
designation economic effects.

Economic Baseline 


In assessing the economic impacts of the critical habitat designation, the Service has used the expected economic
situation consistent with restrictions that were in place at the time of proposing critical habitat. The principal
land use restrictions that were already in place were the BLM's Management Framework Plans, Resource Management
Plans, and habitat management plans; the BLM's Rangewide Plan; National Park Service land management policies;
military land-use policies; and the listing of the desert tortoise as a threatened species (section 7 jeopardy standard
and section 9 prohibitions). 
Industry (e.g., grazing and mining) and recreation-related effects of designating critical habitat concern primarily
those activities not already affected by earlier decisions. For all activities, however, it is the incremental effects
of avoiding adverse modification of critical habitat and the marginal changes in ensuing benefits and costs that
are the appropriate measures of the effects of critical habitat designation. 
Desert tortoise management and curtailment of the activities that threatened the species began when the BLM established
the Desert Tortoise Preserve in 1973 in the Western Mojave Desert (Brussard 

et al.

 1993). The preserve was expanded and formally designated a Research Natural Area and an Area of Critical Environmental
Concern (ACEC) by 1980 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). In 1988, the BLM published its Rangewide Plan (Spang


et al.

 1988), which is based on the categorization of desert tortoise habitat on BLM land into three categories based on:

(1) Importance of the habitat to maintaining viable populations, 
(2) Resolvability of conflicts, 
(3) Desert tortoise density, and 
(4) Desert tortoise population status (stable, increasing, or decreasing). 
Category 1 lands are the most important to desert tortoises for survival and recovery, and category 3 lands are the
least important. The Rangewide Plan provides management goals and objectives for each form of authorized multiple
use within each of the categories on Federal land managed by the BLM, including livestock grazing, mining, and OHV
activities. All CHUs in this final rule minimally include category 1 and/or 2 habitats. Additionally, CHUs contain
some category 3 habitats, uncategorized habitats, and lands managed by other Federal entities. 
The Service has assumed a distinction exists between the effects of listing the species and the incremental effects
of designating critical habitat. The differences between listing and designation of critical habitat vary within
each CHU based on existing management.

Eight CHUs, or portions thereof, are designated in California (Chemehuevi, Chuckwalla, Pinto Mountain, Piute-Eldorado
(includes Fenner DWMA), Ivanpah, Fremont-Kramer, Ord-Rodman, and Superior-Cronese). All are managed primarily
by the BLM according to guidance provided in the California Desert Conservation Area Plan of 1980, as amended (Desert
Plan), and the 1992 California Statewide Desert Tortoise Management Policy (Tortoise Management Policy). The Desert
Plan defines four classes of land use with differing management goals and prescriptions. Classes include controlled
use (wilderness and areas recommended for wilderness), limited use, moderate use, and intensive use (vehicle travel
restrictions range from designated routes only in limited-use areas to no vehicular restrictions in intensive use
areas). The Tortoise Management Policy designates three categories of desert tortoise habitat in which varying
levels of protection are afforded to the desert tortoise and its habitat. Additional management guidance is provided
in livestock allotment management plans (AMPs), habitat management plans (HMPs) for desert tortoises and other
wildlife species, the East Mojave National Scenic Area Plan, and management plans for specific ACECs. 
The West Mojave Coordinated Management Plan and the Eastern Colorado Desert HMP are BLM management plans currently
in preparation that will have an important effect on desert tortoise management in California. The West Mojave Coordinated
Management Plan will be the basis for a programmatic section 7 consultation for BLM activities in the western Mojave
Desert and may serve as a basis for habitat conservation plan(s) for local governments in the section 10(a)(1)(B)
permit process. The Eastern Colorado Desert HMP will address all BLM activities in the Chuckwalla Bench area and will
provide a framework for a programmatic section 7 consultation. 
The Chuckwalla CHU is managed by the BLM and the Navy (Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range). Parts of the Superior-Cronese
CHU are managed by the Army (National Training Center at Ft. Irwin) and the Navy (China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station).
The Fremont-Kramer CHU includes a portion of Edwards Air Force Base. Portions of the Piute-Eldorado and Ivanpah CHUs
in California are within the boundaries of the East Mojave National Scenic Area, which affords special protection
to the area's natural, scenic, and other values (BLM 1980). 
Several programmatic and other biological opinions have resulted in additional regulation of activities within
desert tortoise habitat in California. Biological opinions have limited grazing of sheep to category 3 habitats.
Programmatic consultations have been completed for land use plans at the Naval Air Weapons Station and the Rand-Fremont
Valley areas. The Service has also completed a biological opinion concerning the on-going mission for the Army's
National Training Center at Ft. Irwin. Programmatic consultations also exist that define standard terms and conditions
for mining operations disturbing less than 10 acres, for non-competitive vehicle races, such as poker runs, which
occur on designated routes in some desert tortoise areas, and for the four OHV management areas within the western
Mojave Desert. 
The Service and the BLM are currently developing a programmatic approach to long-term pipeline maintenance. The
Service and the Navy are also informally consulting on a programmatic consultation for training activities at the
Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) and within the Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range. 
In Nevada, the majority of the desert tortoise habitat is managed by the BLM under the Clark County Management Framework
Plan. The Stateline Resource Area of the Las Vegas District has prepared a draft Resource Management Plan that proposes
designation of ACECs for desert tortoises; however, this document has not yet been finalized. Livestock grazing
in Nevada is restricted to the period of June 15 to March 1, in accordance with the BLM's proposed livestock grazing
program and the Service's biological opinion that analyzed that proposal. However, as of this date, the BLM's decision
to implement this seasonal restriction has been stayed by an Administrative Law Judge. Although Interior Board of
Land Appeals Administrative Law Judges have the authority to review land use decisions made by Interior agencies,
they lack jurisdiction needed to review biological opinions issued by the Service. In southern Clark County, portions
of the Piute-Eldorado CHU are also managed by the National Park Service (Lake Mead National Recreation Area). 
In 1991, the Piute-Eldorado Valley was established as a Tortoise Management Area (TMA), as mitigation for the incidental
take of desert tortoises in the Las Vegas Valley, pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. The Short-Term Habitat
Conservation Plan for the Desert Tortoise in the Las Vegas Valley, Clark County, Nevada (Regional Environmental
Consultants 1991), which described this mitigation, provides land-use control measures for this area. These measures
include prohibition of competitive and commercial events, except in some portions of Eldorado Valley, placing livestock
grazing areas into non-use status, and designation of roads and trails.

The majority of the lands within the Gold Butte-Pakoon and Beaver Dam Slope CHUs in Arizona are managed by the BLM under
the Arizona Strip Management Plan. This plan designates the Beaver Dam Slope ACEC and includes management prescriptions
designed to minimize impacts to desert tortoises and their habitat. All desert tortoise habitat in Arizona is within
the area managed by the Virgin River-Pakoon Basin Habitat Management Plan, a cooperative Sikes Act document written
by the BLM and the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Additionally, desert tortoise habitat occurring in wilderness
areas in Arizona is managed according to the Paiute-Beaver Dam Wilderness Management Plan and the Grand Wash Cliffs
Wilderness Management Plan. Grazing is administered according to the Cedar Wash, Highway, Beaver Dam Slope, Mormon
Well, Littlefield Community, Mesquite Community, Mosby-Nay, Pakoon Springs, Pakoon, Cottonwood, Mud and Cane,
and Tassi Allotment Management Plans. In addition to prescriptions set forth in these allotment management plans,
a Service biological opinion on livestock grazing limited grazing to the period from June 1 to March 15. 
In Utah, the Beaver Dam Slope CHU is primarily managed by the BLM. In the Castle Cliffs allotment, a 3,040-acre exclosure
encompassing the historic Woodbury-Hardy study area and several other important tortoise shelter site areas was
established to serve as a natural study area to enhance the tortoise population. However, the exclosure was never
completely operational or effective in eliminating grazing in the area. The BLM reduced the exclosure to 1,500 acres,
where grazing was completely excluded. The Dixie Resource Area developed a resource management plan for the area,
but the final document was rejected and the process has been reinitiated. Currently, BLM management in the Beaver
Dam Slope CHU is conducted under the Habitat Management Plan adopted in 1980. 
The BLM and the State of Utah are the primary managers of the Upper Virgin River CHU. Smaller amounts of habitat are owned
by private entities and by the Paiute Indians. Several consultations have been initiated regarding grazing, housing
development, horse racing, and energy pipeline developments, for which the Service has prepared draft biological
opinions. Also, Washington County is pursuing development of a habitat conservation plan for the area encompassing
the Upper Virgin River CHU, and the Service is providing guidance for development of this plan. The BLM is pursuing
land exchanges with the State of Utah for consolidation of desert tortoise habitat within the Upper Virgin River CHU
for ease of management and for long-term conservation of the desert tortoise and other desert species. The BLM's Dixie
Resource Area is currently preparing a Resource Management Plan to guide land management on BLM lands encompassing
the Upper Virgin River CHU. Because of the area's small size and its proximity to an expanding urban population center,
the Service has maintained that any significant losses of habitat within this area would likely jeopardize the continued
existence of desert tortoises within the Upper Virgin River Recovery- Unit. 


Limitations of the Analysis 


The regional economy includes the full economic activity of each county in which proposed CHUs are located. CHUs generally
are located in remote areas containing a very small fraction of the human population and total economic activity within
a county. The entire county economy may not be affected by establishing CHUs; thus, the size of the relevant regional
economy may be overstated. Likewise, important activities in rural areas may appear to be insignificant when compared
to the entire regional economy. For example, mining does not appear to be an important employer in the seven counties,
but may contribute to the economic stability of small rural communities that offer few other employment opportunities.



Costs of Critical Habitat Designation 


The following sections summarize the results of the Service's analysis of data and identify the potential costs associated
with the final designation of critical habitat. 


Regional Effects to Livestock Industry 


Public lands in the four States in 1990 furnished nearly 3,000 operators with cattle grazing permits that provided
more than 3 million AUMs (Table 4). The designation of critical habitat may partially or totally affect 51 cattle permits
that provided 59,000 AUMs. Nearly all sheep grazing was eliminated from most CHUs prior to critical habitat designation;
therefore, sheep grazing was not an activity examined in the economic analysis. The effect of CHU restrictions on
the availability of Federal land for grazing varies widely among the States, from 0.6 percent of cattle AUMs in Nevada
to 9.6 percent of cattle AUMs in California. Across the four States, CHUs may affect 1.7 percent of cattle and sheep
grazing AUMs (note these effects apply to the States rather than the seven-county region, for which comparable data
were not available). 
The economic consequences of reduced cattle grazing on Federal lands to establish the proposed CHUs includes three
effects. Ranch profits in the seven counties are estimated to fall by $4,470,000. This amount is the estimated permanent
decrease in ranch profits, capitalized at 10 percent for a 50 year period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice


et al. 

(1978). The Federal government will compensate allottees with a one-time payment estimated at $376,000 for the loss
of permanent improvements to grazing lands (pending BLM administrative decisions of partially affected allotments).
Discontinuing grazing leases will result in an annual reduction of $170,000 in collected grazing fees that are divided
among range improvements, the U.S. Treasury, and local governments. The $170,000 is not a ``net'' annual reduction
in that it does not include the reduced costs of grazing program administration.

Regional Effects of Mining Industry



The Service does not anticipate disruption to current mining operations from designation of critical habitat. The
Service notes that active or previously disturbed mine sites typically do not provide suitable habitat for desert
tortoises. Those areas, such as currently operating mine sites, lacking primary constituent elements are not considered
critical habitat.

Expansion of mining sites on public land would require section 7 consultation to determine whether the expansion
would likely destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. In cases where habitat is likely to be adversely modified,
the Service may recommend reasonable and prudent alternatives, including relocation of roads or recovery of disturbed
mine sites. Mining claims provide rights to explore and develop mineral deposits but there is no assurance that deposits
can be developed economically.

Claims may never be developed if market conditions do not warrant or if reserves prove insignificant. The uncertainty
involved in mining claims and mineral reserves precludes accurate estimation of economic effects from designation
of critical habitat.



Reductions in County Revenues



Potential revenue loss to the seven counties examined in the economic analysis due to reduced use of existing Federal
leases and/or permits is not precisely calculable due to several factors, including (but not limited to):

(1) The aggregate number of leases for grazing that have been issued under section 15 of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934,
and from which a 50 percent revenue-sharing basis exists, as opposed to section 3 permits that carry a basis of 12.5
percent revenue sharing with the affected county;

(2) The final administrative decision by the BLM to partly or completely terminate certain permits/leases for grazing
predicated upon their location, existing ingress/egress to other lands, etc.; and

(3) The percentage mixture of the above two types of permits issued by the BLM and its attendant fee structure.

Although it is known that certain grazing fees in each of the counties will be reduced and/or foregone, it is not possible
to estimate accurately the dollar impact on the specific county level until the BLM has concluded its administrative
decision process. The effect to the seven counties is expected to total approximately $21,000 (the minimum 12.5 percent
local share of the $170,000 grazing fees collected on allotments affected by critical habitat designation).

Net Economic Effect to U.S. Treasury 


The U.S. Treasury's portion of grazing fees collected by the BLM in fiscal year 1989 was insufficient to cover the direct
costs of administering grazing programs in eight BLM districts in the hot deserts of the southwest. According to a
1991 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the BLM collected grazing fees totaling $3.97 million
from the eight BLM desert districts. Half of this amount ($1.98 million) was returned to the grazing programs for range
improvements, the U.S. Treasury received a maximum 37.5 percent ($1.49 million) of the fees, and local governments
received a minimum of 12.5 percent ($496,000). The U.S. Treasury thus received no more than $1.49 million, 53 percent
of the $2.79 million expense for grazing management in the eight BLM districts. According to GAO: 



``Critics of livestock grazing could argue that the costs of managing livestock grazing * * * exceeded
the funds available to the Treasury to offset these management costs. Proponents could counter that * * *
grazing fees more than offset * * * management costs and provided funds for State and county projects
as well as for range improvements. 
No matter how costs are analyzed, the resources currently being spent on range management * * * are
insufficient to perform all essential tasks. [I]nsufficient funding and staffing have been instrumental in the
BLM's inability to restore degraded riparian areas, deal with overstocked grazing allotments, and detect livestock
grazing trespass. Consistent with our findings, the BLM has concluded that its current budget is inadequate to perform
all needed land management tasks throughout the public lands'' (U.S. General Accounting Office 1991).

 

Based on the GAO's findings, the U.S. Treasury may realize a net financial gain from discontinuing or reducing Federal
grazing programs in the hot desert (assuming administrative costs were reduced accordingly and not reassigned).
Although the potential savings to the U.S. Treasury was not evaluated in the Draft Economic Analysis, it is reasonable
to assume that discontinuation of grazing on the public lands designated as critical habitat for the desert tortoise
may contribute to those savings. 


Employment Effects 


Designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise is expected to result in the loss of no more than 425 jobs in
the seven-county region (Table 5). This estimate includes 340 jobs lost directly in ranching and 85 jobs lost indirectly
in other industries. This job loss, due to the reduction of Federal grazing permits in CHUs, is an insignificant proportion
of the 1,535,100 workers employed in the seven counties in 1990. Specific employment losses cannot be estimated for
each county until the BLM decides on how to handle partially affected grazing allotments. This total job loss will
be reduced if there is replacement of affected permits by permits on unaffected lands (Federal or private) or if those
laborers transfer to jobs on unaffected ranch lands. These estimated employment losses will not be permanent for
most laborers, as it is anticipated that over 85 percent will be reemployed within 2 years. 
Critical habitat designation is not expected to result in lost jobs in the mining sector because current mining operations
will not be affected by designation. The impact on future employment in the mining sector cannot be calculated reliably
because of the uncertainty of future expansion and development of claims.

Summary of Potential Impacts 



The economic consequences of designating critical habitat includes reduced ranch profits in the seven counties
of $4,470,000 (this amount is the estimated permanent decrease in ranch profits capitalized at 10 percent for a 50-year
period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice 

et al.

 (1978)). The Federal government will compensate allottees with a one-time payment estimated at $376,000 for the
loss of permanent improvements to grazing lands (pending BLM administrative decisions of partially affected allotments).
Discontinuing grazing will result in an annual reduction of $170,000 in collected grazing fees that are divided among
range improvements, the U.S. Treasury, and local governments. 

Critical habitat designation should result in the loss of fewer than 425 total jobs in the seven counties. These include
340 direct ranching jobs and 85 indirect jobs in other industries. The estimated employment loss will not be permanent
because over 85 percent of laborers will be reemployed within 2 years. 



Benefits of Critical Habitat Designation 



Conservation of the desert tortoise and its habitat through designation of critical habitat may result in a wide range
of benefits. These benefits include preservation of recreation and existence values that will increase the benefits
for most affected activities. Scenic beauty contributes to the quality of desert recreational experiences. Many
of the CHUs are adjacent to or within Wilderness Study Areas or in designated Wilderness Areas. Habitat conservation
will enhance the wilderness values of these adjacent or contiguous areas. Habitat preservation also provides for
improved water quality, scenic and air quality, biological diversity, and other environmental benefits. 

Many of the resource services provided by critical habitat are not marketed. The lack of market prices makes it difficult
to value them in dollar terms, as compared to some cost impacts, such as impacts to livestock grazing. As a result, this
analysis currently focuses on the cost impacts, primarily related to livestock grazing. No comprehensive estimate
of the benefits of designating critical habitat is feasible with available data. Rather, the analysis provides a
discussion of the kinds of benefits that are expected to ensue, with empirical data and examples as available. Existence
values represent an additional category of non-use benefit, albeit one that remains difficult to measure. Furthermore,
society places preservation benefits on endangered species for the option of future recreational use, with the knowledge
that the desert tortoise's natural ecosystem exists and is protected, and the satisfaction from its bequest to future
generations. Many of these benefits are expected to increase in relative value over time. As human activities continue
to reduce desert ecosystems, the remaining areas will become less available and more valuable. Habitat protection
for the desert tortoise clearly benefits other species, as well as the human use and enjoyment of these species. 

Dividing the sum of benefits between the various parts by which gains are generated is a delicate task. If preservation
of a species is accomplished wholly through designating critical habitat, then the full value of benefits could be
attributed to that action. Typically, however, preservation is attained through a set of interactive management
actions, each of which is essential to success and no one of which can be singled out as the sole means by which a species
is preserved (Walsh 1992). Given the information at hand, and without better understanding the network of consequences
from management alternatives, it is not possible to disaggregate the sum of benefits to identify that portion directly
attributable to critical habitat designation. 



Biodiversity Benefits 



Designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise will contribute to the protection of the biotic diversity
of the arid Southwest. The tortoise's habitat includes components that make it useful to a variety of other desert
species whose existence is enhanced through retention of original characteristics of their habitat. Modification
or elimination of activities that would adversely modify the natural ecology of the region will conserve the desert
tortoise, as well as other animal and plant species. 



Recreational Use Benefits 



Direct, non-consumptive recreational use of the desert tortoise (i.e., tortoise watching) occurs, although it
is limited by the desert tortoise's burrowing habits and its relatively dispersed populations. Some recreational
activities may be relocated or restricted due to critical habitat designation, particularly OHV use. 



Intrinsic Values 



Users and non-users of natural resources place value on knowing that resources will exist in the future. Benefits,
which may be substantial, reside in the form of ensured future existence and availability for use and in the ability
to preserve the resource for future generations. By designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise, land managers
will assure the retention of option and bequest values, potentially providing benefits far outside the designated
habitat region.

Long-Term Effects of Critical Habitat Designation 



The analysis of economic impacts of critical habitat designation was based primarily on data that are both current
and calculable. Long-term economic impacts, especially on a county-level basis, explicitly have not been addressed.
For example, although there may be a very low level of temporary unemployment (less than 0.1 percent) of those laborers
on any given Federal allottee's lease/permit, it is normally anticipated that those workers will be reemployed within
2 years or be shifted to other private ranch lands in the short-term. 

A given county's receipt of grazing fees will be based on final administrative decisions by the surface managing agencies
on the number of issued/reissued permits and their percentage revenue sharing base (cited in Schamberger 

et al.

 1993). 

Mining may be impacted over the long term, but only to the extent that surface expansion is limited explicitly to avoid
adverse modification to critical habitat. If such limitations do occur, they would also be predicated on governmental
administrative decision at that time (by the BLM, military, tribal councils), but reasonably would be expected to
be minimal both in percent and dollar-level impacts. 



Available Conservation Measures 



The purpose of the Act, as stated in section 2(b), is to provide a means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered
and threatened species depend and to provide a program for the conservation of listed species. Section 2(c)(1) of
the Act declares that ``* * * all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered
and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this Act.'' 

The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring
Federal agencies to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs and insuring that Federal
actions will not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat); section 9 (prohibition of taking of listed species); section 10 (wildlife research
permits and habitat conservation planning on non-Federal lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants);
land acquisition; and research. Other Federal laws also require conservation of endangered and threatened species,
such as the Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and various other State and Federal
laws and regulations. 

The Service's intent in designating critical habitat is to provide habitat that contains primary constituent elements
in sufficient quantities to maintain viable populations of desert tortoises within the six recovery units. Critical
habitat designation will help reduce the risk associated with the near-term reduction in desert tortoise numbers
and cumulative loss of habitat anticipated from on-going management plans. Critical habitat offers additional
protection through section 7, but it does not replace the management recommendations provided by the Draft Recovery
Plan. Designation of critical habitat will, however, provide regulatory protection and help retain options until
long-term conservation plans are accepted and fully implemented. 



Other Protections 



The States of Nevada, California, Arizona, and Utah have established laws that provide varying levels of protection
for individual desert tortoises. The State of Nevada affords limited protection to the desert tortoise, having established
it as a protected reptile under section 501.110.1(d) of the Nevada Revised Statutes, protected and rare outside of
the urban areas of Clark County (Las Vegas) under section 503.080.2 of the Nevada Administrative Code, and unlawful
to transport across State lines without the written consent of the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Nevada does not
have any laws that regulate the degradation of desert tortoise habitat. 

The California Fish and Game Commission listed the desert tortoise as a State threatened species on June 22, 1989,
amending the California Code of Regulations, section 670.5(b)(4) of title 14. California has also designated the
desert tortoise as its official State reptile. 

The Arizona Game and Fish Commission extended full protection from take to the desert tortoise, effective January
1, 1988, through Commission Order 43: Reptiles. Also prohibited is the sale of desert tortoises and their importation
to the State, as well as the release of captive tortoises into the wild. There is no State authority in Arizona to regulate
the modification of desert tortoise habitat. 

In Utah, the desert tortoise is considered a ``prohibited reptile,'' protecting it from collection, importation,
transportation, possession, sale, transfer, or release because it poses unacceptable disease, ecological, environmental,
or human health or safety risks. No State regulations exist to stop the loss or degradation of desert tortoise habitat
through land development or other actions (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990).

Recovery Planning and Section 7 Consultation 


Recovery planning under section 4(f) of the Act is the ``umbrella'' that eventually guides all of the Act's activities
and promotes a species' conservation and eventual delisting. Because critical habitat designation was based on
recommendations provided in the Draft Recovery Plan, final critical habitat will be incorporated as part of the final
recovery plan for the desert tortoise. The Service has worked closely with the Recovery Team and other efforts to ensure
consistency and will reevaluate the need for critical habitat after completion and implementation of the recovery
plan or at any time that new information indicates that changes may be warranted. The Service may also reassess critical
habitat designation if other land management plans or conservation strategies, which may reduce the need for the
additional protection provided by critical habitat designation, are developed and fully implemented. 
Although critical habitat is not intended as a management or conservation plan, association with the Draft Recovery
Plan leaves the perception that critical habitat is a form of that plan. The Draft Recovery Plan, critical habitat,
and other conservation processes are working with the same land base containing the same specific locations of desert
tortoise populations within recovery units; it is therefore inevitable that these processes overlap. Critical
habitat is based upon the recommendations of the Draft Recovery Plan because it lays out a framework for identifying
and evaluating habitat that is founded on scientific principles. Designation of critical habitat does not offer
specific direction for managing desert tortoise habitat. That type of direction, as well as any change in direction,
will come through administration of other facets of the Act (e.g., section 7, section 10, and recovery planning) or
through development of land management plans addressing the desert tortoise. 
The final DWMA boundaries will be determined by land management agencies, in consultation with the Service, through
a planning process that is coordinated with local government and interested members of the public. The Service intends
that critical habitat for the Mojave desert tortoise population conform to the DWMA boundaries determined through
the recovery planning and implementation process. Because the agency planning process for determining the DWMA
boundaries will not be completed until after critical habitat for the Mojave desert tortoise population is initially
designated, adjustments to critical habitat may need to be made in subsequent rulemaking documents to make critical
habitat correspond to the DWMAs. As soon as the agency planning process for delineating DWMA boundaries is completed,
the Service will consider publishing a proposed rule to effect appropriate adjustments in the critical habitat boundaries
for the affected recovery unit(s).

Section 7 Consultation 


Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out
are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies, and is
in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize
the continued existence of any listed species. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision
of the Act are found at 50 CFR part 402. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if
it determines an action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse
modification of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate
jeopardy and incidental take of the species. 
Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both
the survival and recovery of a species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR
402.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival
and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly state that such alterations include, but are not limited
to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining
the habitat to be critical. 
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy, are directly related.
Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. The closer one is to recovery,
the greater the certainty in the species' continued survival. The terms ``survival and recovery'' are thus related
by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a given period of time. Survival relates to viability.
Factors that influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution throughout the range, stochasticity,
expected duration, and reproductive success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high degree of
certainty for the species' continued viability. 
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species'
conservation, which by definition equates to recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat apply to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species,
thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation
to the goals and recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery,
the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat should provide for the protection
of the critical habitat's ability to contribute fully to a species' recovery. Thus, the adverse modification standard
may be reached closer to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas the jeopardy standard traditionally
has been applied nearer to the extinction end of the continuum. 


Basis for Analysis 


Designation of critical habitat focuses on the primary constituent elements within the defined units and their contribution
to the species' recovery, based on consideration of the species' biological needs and factors that contribute to
recovery (e.g., distribution, numbers, reproduction, and viability). The evaluation of actions that may affect
critical habitat for the desert tortoise should consider the effects of the action on any of the factors that were the
basis for determining the habitat to be critical, including the primary constituent elements of nesting, foraging,
sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow, as well as the contribution of the area to recovery. The Service will focus
on a proposed action's effect on the eventual recovery of the tortoise in a CHU (e.g., the type of activities that led
to the tortoise's listing, such as habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation). The Service would issue an adverse
modification opinion if it determined that a proposed action was likely to preclude recovery of the tortoise in a particular
unit. 
The range of the desert tortoise has been divided into six recovery units in the Draft Recovery Plan. These areas are
based on genetic, morphological, ecological, and physiological differences among the desert tortoises. The designated
CHUs are intended to provide for viable populations of desert tortoises representing this variation in traits. The
basis for an adverse modification opinion should follow the recommendations in the recovery plan for maintaining
viable populations and variation throughout the range. Should the Recovery Team redefine these parameters in the
final recovery plan, then the basis for analysis under section 7 will follow that basis. 
For a wide-ranging species such as the desert tortoise, where multiple CHUs are designated, each unit has both a local
role and a rangewide role in contributing to the conservation of the species. The loss of a single unit may not jeopardize
the continued existence of the species but may significantly reduce the ability of critical habitat to contribute
to recovery. 
Present conditions vary throughout the range of the desert tortoise, with the result that some areas may be less able
to sustain continuing impacts than others at any given time. The level of disturbance a CHU could withstand and still
fulfill its intended purpose is variable throughout the tortoise's range and will need to be reviewed in the context
of its current status, condition, and location. 
Each project will need review as to its impacts at all levels. When determining whether any particular action would
appreciably diminish the value of the habitat for the survival and recovery of the tortoise, the baseline condition
and expected role for the individual unit and those within the same recovery unit must be considered. Among the factors
to be considered are the extent of the proposed action, the present condition of the habitat (e.g., percent of the area
containing the primary constituent elements, degree of fragmentation, size of the unit), the existing density of
desert tortoises in the unit, the expected time to regenerate sufficient habitat to support an effective population
in a particular area, consistency of the action with the intent of the recovery plan, geographic consideration, and
local and regional problems. The analysis should also consider the effect of the action on critical habitat from actions
planned outside the designated area. Analysis of impacts to individual units must consider the effects to the local
area, the recovery unit in which it resides, and the overall range of the listed species.

Consultation Process 


Section 7 consultation for critical habitat will focus on the effects of actions on tortoise habitat whether or not
it is currently occupied. The presence or absence of tortoises will not factor into the determination of actions that
trigger section 7. Any action that may affect critical habitat will trigger section 7 consultation. 
The requirement to consider adverse modification of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration
above and beyond section 7 review necessary to evaluate jeopardy and incidental take. As required by 50 CFR 402.14,
a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines an action may affect a listed species or its critical
habitat. Federal agencies are responsible for determining whether or not to consult with the Service and should consider
a number of factors when determining if a proposed action may affect critical habitat. To the extent possible, agencies
should consult on a programmatic basis. 
The Service will consider the effect of the proposed action on the primary constituent elements along with the reasons
why that particular area was determined to be critical habitat. The trigger to initiate section 7 consultation (under
adverse modification) is any action that may affect any of the five primary constituent elements of critical habitat
or reduce the potential of critical habitat to develop these elements_this is independent from any action that would
affect known individuals. The evaluation should also take into consideration what happens outside of critical habitat
because such projects may also impact habitat within critical habitat. It should also consider what effects the action
may have on other adjacent CHUs, the recovery unit, and the overall range of the desert tortoise. 


Examples of Proposed Actions 


Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief description
and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by
such designation. Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat
as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival
and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying
any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 
Activities that disturb or remove the primary constituent elements within designated CHUs might adversely modify
the tortoise's critical habitat. These activities may include actions that would reduce the area of a recovery unit
below that which can sustain a viable population or provide for movements, dispersal, and gene flow; reduce the quantity
and quality of forage species, either directly or through soil modifications, thereby affecting the tortoise's
nutritional requirements; reduce the suitability of substrates for burrowing, nesting, and overwintering; reduce
the number and availability of burrow sites, caliche caves, and other shelter sites; appreciably modify the function
and/or availability of vegetation to provide shelter from temperature extremes and predators; and increase the
potential for future habitat disturbance and human-caused mortality. 
A number of Federal agencies or departments fund, authorize, or carry out actions that affect lands that the Service
designates as critical habitat. Among these agencies are the BLM, Department of Defense (DOD), Bureau of Mines, Corps
of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, National
Park Service, Federal Highway Administration, and Department of Housing and Urban Development. Federal agencies
and the Service are currently consulting on numerous activities proposed within the range of the desert tortoise.
These activities include Federal land management plans; Bureau livestock grazing operations; road, trail, and
utility construction and maintenance; mining plans of operation; land sales, leases, and exchanges; Federal housing
loans; BLM recreation and public purpose leases; permits for OHV activities; military operations; sand and gravel
operations; rights-of-way; landfills; and a number of smaller actions. The economic analysis provides more details
on specific projects affected by critical habitat designation.

The Service expects that proposed actions that are inconsistent with land management recommendations for DWMA's
in the Draft Recovery Plan would likely be considered to adversely modify critical habitat. Proposed actions that
are consistent with the recommendations within the Draft Recovery Plan would not be likely to result in destruction
or adverse modification of critical habitat. 
Areas designated as critical habitat support a number of existing and proposed commercial and non-commercial activities.
Commercial activities that may affect desert tortoise critical habitat include, but are not limited to, livestock
grazing, sand and gravel extraction, mining, OHV activities, military operations, landfills, rights-of-way,
and utility corridors. Commercial activities not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat include
various site-specific activities such as scenic tours. Conducting desert tortoise surveys would not likely destroy
or adversely modify critical habitat. Non-commercial activities are largely associated with recreation and are
not considered likely to adversely affect critical habitat, provided they do not involve use of vehicles off of designated
roads. Such activities include hiking, camping, hunting, and various activities associated with nature appreciation.
In certain CHUs where more intensive management is needed (e.g., the Upper Virgin River CHU), the effects of recreational
activities will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
Some activities could be considered to be of benefit to desert tortoise habitat and, therefore, would also not be expected
to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Examples of activities that could be of benefit to critical habitat
include protective measures such as some forms of fire suppression and restoration of disturbed areas. Further research
may support or refute any potential benefits from such actions. At this time, they will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis. 
In general, activities that do not remove or degrade constituent elements of habitat for desert tortoises are not
likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Each proposed action would be examined pursuant to section
7 of the Act in relation to its site-specific impacts. Thus, proposed actions may or may not destroy or adversely modify
critical habitat, depending on the type and extent of the action and the pre-project condition of the area in relation
to desert tortoise habitat needs. The involved Federal agencies can assist the Service in its evaluation of proposed
actions by providing detailed information on the habitat configuration of a project area, habitat conditions of
surrounding areas, and information on known locations of desert tortoises. 
The designation of critical habitat does not imply that lands outside of critical habitat do not play an important
role in the conservation of the desert tortoise. Lands outside of critical habitat are important for providing nesting,
sheltering, foraging, gene flow, and dispersal habitat for desert tortoises. Federal activities outside of critical
habitat are still subject to review under section 7 if they may affect the desert tortoise. The Service expects that
management activities outside of critical habitat on Federal lands would be managed as recommended by a final recovery
plan, Federal land management plans, or other valid plans. 


Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives 


In cases where it is concluded that an action would likely result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat, to the extent possible, the Service is required to provide reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed
action in its biological opinion. By definition, reasonable and prudent alternatives allow the intended purpose
of the proposed action to go forward and remove the conditions that would adversely modify critical habitat_alternatives
may vary according to local conditions, project size, or other factors. The Service recommends that the agencies
initiate discussions early enough in the planning process to preserve a greater number of options to reduce impacts.

Under this scenario, if adverse modification was anticipated, examples of possible reasonable and prudent alternatives
that may be provided in a biological opinion include: 
(1) Relocating the planned action to another location, 
(2) Modifying the action to minimize fragmentation, and/or 
(3) Modifying the action to implement land management practices that are known to be compatible with maintaining
primary constituent elements for the desert tortoise. 
For some actions, the Service may propose minor modifications to the project design that may avoid adverse modification
of critical habitat. In the case of a proposed upgrade of a powerline right-of-way corridor, for example, the Service
may recommend that the corridor be expanded on one side of the existing corridor versus the other side to avoid impacts
to habitat where the primary constituent elements are of higher quality. For projects that may result in more severe
impacts, substantial project changes may be necessary. The Service would propose reasonable and prudent alternatives
to the agency's proposed action. Reasonable and prudent alternatives, by definition, would allow the intended purpose
of the project to go forward without adversely modifying critical habitat.

<DOCNO> FR940208-0-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-0-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

No reasonable and prudent alternatives may be available for some proposed actions. For example, due to the size of
a unit or high levels of existing fragmentation, no level of habitat disturbance may be possible without resulting
in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. In these situations, the Service would issue an adverse
modification biological opinion with no reasonable and prudent alternatives. The Service recommends that agencies
initiate discussions at the earliest opportunity to help avoid this type of situation. 
Research on desert tortoises and their habitat may negatively affect critical habitat. Wherever possible, research
should be conducted outside of CHUs, coordinated throughout the listed range of the tortoise, and based upon an approved
long-term strategy. 


Conservation Measures on Non-Federal Lands 


State, private, and Tribal lands have been included within the designation of critical habitat. Critical habitat
designation will not affect non-Federal lands except for actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a
Federal agency. Actions on State and private lands will continue to be subject to section 9 of the Act, requiring an
incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act for any actions that may result in take of desert
tortoises. This provision also will apply to actions on Tribal lands without a Federal nexus. Those with a Federal
nexus will be subject to section 7 consultation under the Act. 
Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and non-intentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners
regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat. The term ``take,'' as defined by the Act, means
to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.
``Harass'' is defined as an intentional or negligent act or omission that creates the likelihood of injury to wildlife
by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns, which includes breeding,
feeding, or sheltering. ``Harm'' in the definition of ``take'' means any action, including habitat modification,
which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation
where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including
breeding, feeding, or sheltering (50 CFR part 17). 
Section 10(a)(1)(B) authorizes the Service to issue permits for the taking of listed species incidental to otherwise
lawful activities, such as housing development. Incidental take permit applications must be supported by a habitat
conservation plan (HCP) that identifies conservation measures that the permittee agrees to implement to conserve
the species. A key element of the Service's review of an HCP is a determination of the plan's effect upon the long-term
conservation of the species. An HCP would be approved and a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit issued if it would minimize
and mitigate the impacts of the taking and would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of
that species in the wild. 
Due to limited Federal involvement, the Service expects that few, if any, formal section 7 consultations would be
initiated for State lands that are included in critical habitat. The States are subject to the ``take'' prohibitions
under section 9 of the Act, however, and may enter into the section 10 HCP process where appropriate. 
Desert tortoises occurring on lands outside critical habitat boundaries are still subject to section 9 prohibitions.
The Service envisions that the role of desert tortoise habitat in the conservation of the species will be addressed
through section 7, the HCP process, the recovery planning process, and other appropriate State and Federal laws.
On these lands, it is expected that recovery goals will be achieved through the use of other conservation mechanisms
available to the Service and other landowners (e.g., land exchanges, conservation and development easements).

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the August 30, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, the Service requested all interested parties
to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of this final rule. The public comment
period was open from August 30, 1993, to October 29, 1993. During that period, the Service conducted three public hearings
on this issue at the following locations: Riverside, California, on October 6, 1993; Las Vegas, Nevada, on October
12, 1993; and St. George, Utah, on October 14, 1993. The Service accepted testimony from the public from 1 to 4 p.m. and
from 6 to 8 p.m on each of those days. The Service announced the dates, times, and locations of the public hearings in
the August 30, 1993, proposed rule (58 FR 45748). Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies,
scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and asked to comment. In addition, the Service
published notices in the Kingman Daily Miner, Las Vegas Review Journal, Las Vegas Sun, Barstow Desert Dispatch, The
Sun, and the Press Enterprise on September 23, 1993, and in the Daily Spectrum on September 16, 1993, announcing the
publication of the proposed rule and the dates, times, and locations of the public hearings. 
During the 60-day comment period, the Service received approximately 270 written comments. In addition, 147 people
testified at the three public hearings. The Service received comments from the BLM, the Bureau of Mines, other Federal
agencies, military installations, State and county agencies, town boards, environmental organizations, the mining
industry, recreational enthusiasts, and the ranching industry. Comments are part of the administrative record
and are available for public review. Issues raised during the public comment period announced in the August 30, 1993,
proposal, whether written or oral, are discussed below. 


Issue 1:

 One respondent requested that the Service adjust the boundaries of CHUs to reflect the boundaries proposed for the
East Mojave National Park, as depicted in Senate Bill 21. 


Service Response:

 The Service cannot assume that the legislation for the East Mojave National Park will pass or what form it will take.
The boundaries proposed for the East Mojave National Park in Senate Bill 21 reflect the balancing of a variety of concerns,
both biotic and abiotic, and should not be expected to resemble boundaries reflecting habitat critical to the recovery
of a single species. Should the East Mojave National Park be established, the Service will reevaluate the designation
of critical habitat, if appropriate. 


Issue 2:

 The Service received several comments regarding the presence of unsuitable habitat within proposed CHUs. Examples
of areas already developed that were included in the proposal were golf courses, buildings, towns, and existing mining
operations. Many stated that these areas should not be included even for the ease of writing legal descriptions. 


Service Response:

 The Service identified large contiguous blocks of tortoise habitat containing the primary constituent elements
that support nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow, primarily on Federal lands. To the extent
possible, the Service adjusted boundaries to exclude peripheral areas that do not support primary constituent elements.
However, it was not possible to exclude all areas of non-habitat via boundary revisions. In some cases, CHUs contain
small towns, farms, or human-made structures. These areas, although physically located within the boundaries of
critical habitat, are not included in critical habitat designation because they do not contain any of the primary
constituent elements of desert tortoise habitat. Areas not currently containing all of the essential features,
but with the capability to do so in the future, may still be needed for the long-term conservation of the species, particularly
in certain portions of the range. 


Issue 3:

 Some respondents stated that the Service should use natural landmarks for critical habitat boundaries and legal
descriptions rather than section lines. Use of section lines instead of natural or human-made boundaries will make
enforcement difficult, if not impossible. One letter stated that, in a majority of cases (according to the BLM), documented
sheep trespasses during the 1993 grazing season occurred where there were ambiguous boundary lines. 


Service Response:

 In designating critical habitat, the Service is required to legally define boundaries. In this effort, the Service
has primarily used section lines. The Service also used major roads to legally define some of the CHUs.

Issue 4: 

Many commenters suggested removing specific areas from the proposal. Such suggestions typically reflected concerns
over inclusion of private lands in the proposal or were based on potentially conflicting uses, especially mining
areas. Some letters provided additional biological information to support site-specific deletions from critical
habitat. 


Service Response: 

The Service has reviewed the individual requests and determined whether the critical habitat boundaries should
be modified to avoid non-tortoise habitat. Where possible, considering restraints of the map scale with which the
Service was working, boundary lines have been modified. Areas suggested for deletion on the basis of perceived land-use
conflicts were deleted if they did not meet the criteria for inclusion or did not provide important benefits to the
species. Areas suggested for deletion because of poor habitat were re-examined in terms of value to tortoises. In
some key areas, habitat currently in poor condition was retained because of its important location and high potential
for contribution to recovery. 


Issue 5: 

A number of commenters stated that critical habitat should not be designated because existing reserved lands, such
as national parks and wildlife refuges, provide sufficient land for the tortoise. 


Service Response: 

The Service determined that the tortoise should be listed as a threatened species in 1990 (55 FR 12178) partly because
insufficient habitat is protected within congressionally protected areas to adequately conserve desert tortoises.
In addition, the Draft Recovery Plan recognizes that areas of sufficient size to support self-sustaining tortoise
populations do not exist in already protected habitats. Critical habitat is primarily designated for areas identified
in the Draft Recovery Plan as necessary for recovery of the desert tortoise. 


Issue 6: 

Many commenters stated that the Service had proposed to designate too much habitat for the desert tortoise. 


Service Response: 

The Service proposed critical habitat designation for those areas that met certain criteria. The proposed and final
designations include at least one CHU within each of the six recovery units outlined in the Draft Recovery Plan. The
size of these areas is based primarily on the requirements to support self-sustaining populations. Land management
agencies, in consultation with the Service, may establish desert wildlife management areas in which the desert tortoise
will receive special consideration. Upon establishment of these areas, the Service may reevaluate the critical
habitat designation. 


Issue 7: 

Several respondents stated that the designation should include other important desert tortoise habitats, especially
the southern portion of Ft. Irwin, Joshua Tree National Monument, the Desert Tortoise Natural Area (DTNA), and the
Desert National Wildlife Range. They stated that Congressional withdrawal of public lands within the DTNA from the
general mining and mineral laws must be renewed after 20 years (year 2000). If mineral extraction is allowed after
that time, designation of the DTNA as critical habitat may be the only way to protect this habitat from the effects of
mining. Some respondents questioned why management plans developed for the DTNA and Joshua Tree National Monument
are sufficient to preclude critical habitat designation, yet the BLM's Conservation Plan of 1980 is ignored. One
letter said that such inconsistencies degrade the Service's contention that the DTNA is protected so well that it
need not be included in the critical habitat designation.

Service Response: 

The critical habitat designation includes the southern 2 mile-strip of Ft. Irwin, which is south of where most existing
military operations have already degraded or eliminated desert tortoise habitat. Joshua Tree National Monument,
the DTNA, and the Desert National Wildlife Range were not included in the designation of critical habitat because
the designation would not afford these areas any additional benefit. The mandates of the Service and the National
Park Service provide for ecosystem management, and those of the BLM are for multiple use of public lands. The DTNA is
managed specifically for the benefit of the desert tortoise as both a research natural area and an Area of Critical
Environmental Concern. The specified areas are considered important for recovery of the desert tortoise in the Draft
Recovery Plan and will be considered in establishing desert wildlife management areas. If, in the future, mineral
extraction or other actions that may adversely affect critical habitat are proposed to be allowed within these areas,
the Service may reevaluate whether additional critical habitat should be designated. 


Issue 8: 

Several people were concerned that critical habitat would restrict access to their private lands or mining operations.



Service Response: 

The Service anticipates being able to work with other Federal agencies to minimize effects on private landowners.
Section 7 consultation requirements on Federal rights-of-way applications may, in some limited cases, result in
additional mitigation requirements or modified access to private lands, but the Service cannot quantify the economic
effects. 


Issue 9: 

A few letters stated that the critical habitat designation should include the Pahrump/Amargosa Valley. 


Service Response: 

The Service based its critical habitat proposal on those areas recommended for recovery in the Draft Recovery Plan.
The Pahrump/Amargosa Valley was not one of those areas, and, therefore, it was not included in the proposed designation.



Issue 10: 

A few respondents requested inclusion of additional areas as critical habitat for the desert tortoise. One letter
suggested that inclusion of previously disturbed areas will provide buffer zones while recovery of the habitat occurs,
thereby minimizing edge effects of incompatible land uses and providing smooth-edged boundaries that are preferable
in minimizing the boundary-to-area ratio. 


Service Response: 

The Administrative Procedure Act requires Federal agencies to provide appropriate notification of proposed actions
prior to making final determinations. Therefore, the Service cannot adopt a final rule that is significantly different
from the proposed rule without first offering the public an opportunity to comment on the differences. Departmental
policy is to waive notice and public comment only in special cases such as emergencies or instances where a proposed
amendment makes only minor technical changes in a rule. The only addition to critical habitat in the final rule for
desert tortoise critical habitat was the inclusion of 3 square miles of BLM land on the southern boundary of the Beaver
Dam Slope CHU in Arizona. This request for inclusion came from the BLM, as the landowner, to ensure that its desert tortoise
study plot was within desert tortoise critical habitat. No other landowners will be affected by this inclusion. Other
requests for inclusions were considered significant and were not requested by the landowner. In order to meet the
court-mandated schedule for designation of critical habitat, the Service was not able to prepare a second proposal
including any of these areas for public review. Such inclusions may be considered during any future reevaluation
of the designated critical habitat boundaries. 


Issue 11: 

The BIA opposes designation of any critical habitat on any tribal lands. The critical habitat proposal included lands
within Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah-Shivwits Band (Paiute-Shivwits) lands. The BIA maintains that formal consultation
under the section 7 jeopardy standard of the Act provides adequate protection for the desert tortoise.

Service Response: 

The Service expects that all landowners, regardless of their status, will comply with the Act and will contribute
to the conservation of the desert tortoise. Low, medium, and high density desert tortoise habitat exists on Utah tribal
lands. Tribal lands were not excluded from final designation because no new biological or economic information was
provided, and tribal lands contain desert tortoise habitat necessary for recovery of the Upper Virgin River Recovery
Unit. This recovery unit is unique in that it contains some of the highest densities of desert tortoises known throughout
the species' range, and it is the smallest recovery unit, requiring more intensive management to ensure long-term
survivability and ultimate recovery of the unit. Desert tortoise habitat necessary for recovery within the Upper
Virgin River Recovery Unit is not distinguished by landownership boundaries, and it includes Federal, State, private,
and Tribal lands. Following Service approval and implementation of a Washington County HCP, the Service will reevaluate
the critical habitat boundaries and may propose to modify critical habitat, if appropriate. 


Issue 12: 

The Service received several comments concerning the Washington County HCP process, an effort that has been on-going
for more than 2 years. The final critical habitat designation should reflect the final Desert Habitat Preserve, to
be proposed under a Washington County HCP. 


Service Response: 

Washington County, Utah, is preparing an HCP under section 10 of the Act, as part of its application for a permit to take
desert tortoises incidentally. To issue a section 10(a) permit, the Service must determine that, to the maximum extent
practicable, the applicant will minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking. The mitigation for the Washington
County permit includes establishment of a Desert Habitat Preserve, primarily for desert tortoise survival and recovery.
Washington County has not yet submitted an application for a section 10(a) permit or an HCP to the Service. This final
designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise reflects in large part the habitat conservation planning
process to date that, if successful, will result in a desert habitat preserve of sufficient size and configuration
to provide for survival and recovery of desert tortoises in this recovery unit. If the Service approves a Washington
County HCP and issues a permit to take desert tortoises incidentally, the Service may reevaluate critical habitat,
and propose revisions, if appropriate. 


Issue 13: 

The designation of critical habitat will create ``dumping grounds'' for desert tortoises. 


Service Response: 

Handling (e.g., ``dumping'') of desert tortoises is prohibited by the Act, which defines ``take'' to mean to harass,
harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect any listed species. Critical habitat provides
an extra layer of protection for desert tortoise habitat, but has no effect upon the other protections provided by
the Act. 


Issue 14: 

The Desert Habitat Preserve boundary line north of the city of Washington was ``agreed upon'' by members of the Washington
County HCP Steering Committee, and that exact line should be reflected in final designation of critical habitat.



Service Response: 

The Service has not reviewed that ``agreed upon'' line, nor has it approved any aspect of a Washington County HCP to
date. That line will be reviewed in the context of a Desert Habitat Preserve established under a Washington County
HCP, as part of the mitigation for incidental take of desert tortoises and their habitat. 


Issue 15: 

Some respondents perceived critical habitat designation for the desert tortoise as a means by which the Federal government
can seize and ``federalize'' public and private lands. One person saw designation of critical habitat as a Federal
conspiracy. The Service has a hidden political agenda, is deliberately misinforming the public, and is attempting
to control private property, much in the same regard as if under a communist regime. 


Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat does not, in and of itself, impose additional legal restrictions on private lands
except for actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies on those lands. Non-Federal, as
well as Federal lands, with or without designated critical habitat, are still subject to the prohibitions against
take of listed species on their land, pursuant to section 9 of the Act. Designation of critical habitat is not a conspiracy,
but rather is a requirement of the Endangered Species Act for threatened and endangered species. 


Issue 16: 

Numerous comments were received from DOD agencies, requesting that military installations be excluded from designation
of critical habitat. The agencies cited concern over their ability to use existing facilities, the existence of desert
tortoise management plans, the increased cost of managing critical habitat, and existing regulatory mechanisms
that make the designation of critical habitat unnecessary.

Service Response: 

Numerous ongoing activities occur on Federal lands managed by the military. The Service has issued section 7 biological
opinions on many of these activities. These opinions contain terms and conditions, which were usually developed
in coordination with the military, to reduce the take of desert tortoises. Many ongoing activities and existing uses,
such as the bombing ranges at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB), the Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) at China Lake, the
Chocolate Mountains Air Gunnery Range, the communications facilities at the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations'
Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, and the rocket test area at Leuhmann ridge on EAFB, have already resulted
in the removal of the constituent elements of desert tortoise habitat and would not be affected by a designation of
critical habitat. Therefore, military agencies would not be required to relocate existing facilities to areas outside
of critical habitat. 


Issue 17: 

Several DOD agencies were concerned that expansion of existing facilities or the siting of new facilities would be
prohibited by designation of critical habitat. 


Service Response: 

In the case of new or expanded facilities that may affect desert tortoises or designated critical habitat, the DOD
agencies will be required to consult with the Service pursuant to section 7 of the Act. Through the consultation process,
the Service will determine if the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise
or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. The DOD provided no economic data for such future developments
by which the Service could consider the economic costs of designating critical habitat in these areas. 


Issue 18: 

The NAWS and National Training Center at Ft. Irwin cited the existence of desert tortoise management plans on their
lands and the increased costs of managing critical habitat as reasons for excluding these lands from critical habitat
designation.

<PARENT> FR940208-0-00031 </PARENT>

Service Response: 

The Service fully acknowledges the positive efforts on behalf of the desert tortoise already implemented by the Navy
and the Army. Such plans should be considered in establishing recovery areas for the desert tortoise, as recommended
by the Draft Recovery Plan. The DOD should work closely with the BLM and the Service in determining where these recovery
areas will be located and what actions will be implemented within them to effect recovery of the desert tortoise. Following
establishment of recovery areas, the Service will reevaluate its designation of critical habitat. 



Issue 19: 

EAFB expressed concern that designation of critical habitat would prevent use of supersonic corridors in the desert.




Service Response: 

The primary potential adverse effects of supersonic flight on the desert tortoise would be to the tortoises themselves,
as potential harm or harassment. Supersonic flight is not expected to destroy or adversely modify desert tortoise
habitat. 



Issue 20: 

The Marine Corps requested that Twentynine Palms Air Ground Combat Center be removed from critical habitat designation
in the Ord-Rodman CHU. 



Service Response: 

The Service has reevaluated the desert tortoise habitat within the Twentynine Palms Air Ground Combat Center. Off-road
travel by armored vehicles, bombing and strafing with live ammunition, and emergency disposal of ordnance and fuel
from aircraft have resulted in deterioration of habitat quality over large contiguous areas. Based on this reevaluation,
the Service has refined the boundaries of the Ord-Rodman CHU to remove the Twentynine Palms Air Ground Combat Center
from designation as critical habitat. 



Issue 21: 

A few commenters responded that there is no substantive evidence that directly links the decline in tortoise numbers
with livestock grazing, nor is there any evidence that tortoises have suffered because their habitat has been grazed.




Service Response: 

The Service is currently consulting informally with the BLM regarding impacts of livestock grazing on desert tortoise
critical habitat. Although no definitive studies on the relation between livestock grazing and the welfare of desert
tortoises have yet been completed, there is a significant amount of scientific literature on the adverse effects
of livestock grazing on desert ecosystems, in terms of vegetation changes, soil compaction and erosion, and reduction
of microorganisms in the soil. The Service will continue discussions with the BLM and the Desert Tortoise Recovery
Team on this issue. 



Issue 22: 

Some letters stated that utility corridor expansion, road proliferation from illegal OHV activity, legal mineral
exploration, and current grazing practices are existing activities that degrade tortoise habitat. Stopping these
uses that are destructive to existing critical habitat is the answer to protecting the tortoise. 



Service Response: 

As stated previously, designation of critical habitat does not create a land management plan. Federal agencies will
enter into consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act with the Service for all activities that they authorize, fund,
or carry out. Through that consultation, the Service will determine if the actions are likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of the species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. The Federal land management agencies will
address the multiple uses on lands under their administration in the process of establishing desert wildlife management
areas to implement recovery actions for the desert tortoise. 



Issue 23: 

Some people questioned the existence of scientific data that reflects a true depiction of the distribution of desert
tortoises in the West Mojave or elsewhere. 



Service Response: 

Although not every square inch of land in the Mojave Desert has been inventoried for the presence of desert tortoises,
the BLM and other agencies and biologists have spent considerable time and effort conducting desert tortoise surveys
throughout the range of the desert tortoise. Such information has been compiled into the BLM's category and density
maps for the desert tortoise, which are used by many of the agencies involved in desert tortoise management. This information
was also used in preparing the Draft Recovery Plan.

Issue 24: 

Some people stated that the Service should consider the custom and culture and the continued quality of existence
of the human species. The customs and culture of the people should have the same consideration as biology and economics
in determining critical habitat for the desert tortoise. 



Service Response: 

The designation of critical habitat is mandated by the Endangered Species Act and is based on the best scientific data
available after taking into consideration the economic impact and any other relevant impact of specifying an area
as critical habitat. In developing DWMAs, land management agencies will have the opportunity to consider local custom
and culture in their decision processes. 



Issue 25: 

One respondent stated that the Service's statements about increasing OHV use as of 1980 statistics did not address
the extent of lands made unavailable between the years 1980 and 1993. Currently less than 2 percent of the California
desert is accessible for motorized recreation.

Service Response: 

Although more roads have been closed since 1980, between 1980 and 1988, there were more open areas and limited access
areas and fewer closed areas (Biosystems Analysis 1991). In addition, the impact of OHVs on tortoises has increased
over the last decade due to changes in BLM zoning, increases in OHV use, and the proliferation of illegal roads, a factor
that results in serious environmental impacts and a difficult management issue for the BLM. 



Issue 26: 

One letter stated that organized OHV activities in the West Mojave are regulated by section 7 permits issued by the
Service through consultation with the BLM. Because OHVs have abided by these stipulations, expansive designation
of critical habitat is not necessary in light of the protection available through the permitting/stipulation process.




Service Response: 

Through section 7 of the Act, the Service consults with Federal agencies that authorize, fund, or carry out actions
that may affect a listed species. With the listing of a species, the Service determines through these consultations
whether an action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species. The adverse modification standard
may be applied when an action would likely preclude recovery of a listed species. Thus critical habitat provides additional
protection to a species and its habitat through section 7 of the Act. After designation of critical habitat, the Service
will also determine if an action is likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Following designation
of critical habitat, all current activities for which a Federal agency maintains discretionary action must undergo
reinitiation of consultation to analyze whether or not they are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat.
OHV activities within the designated critical habitat are not the only activities that may adversely affect the desert
tortoise and its habitat. 



Issue 27: 

Some letters objected to the general statements that OHV activity results in negative impacts on desert tortoise
habitat without quantifying such effects. 



Service Response: 

The negative impacts of OHV activity on desert tortoise habitat have been quantified extensively since the early
1970s. Tortoises are adversely affected by OHVs through loss of forage and vegetative cover; increased mortality
from crushing, collection, and vandalism; and soil compaction and loss of burrow sites. Because the use of OHVs in
desert areas is a highly charged issue, much attention has been placed on the review of studies and the appropriate
use of statistical tests in the quantifying the resultant data. 



Issue 28: 

Some respondents said that the BLM has already addressed protection of the desert tortoise in the Western Mojave Coordinated
Management Plan and other management plans previously approved and implemented under the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act. Further protection is not necessary. 



Service Response: 

The Western Mojave Coordinated Management Plan is still in the planning stages and, therefore, does not yet afford
the desert tortoise any protection. Upon its finalization and implementation, the Service may reevaluate the critical
habitat designation. 



Issue 29: 

One respondent said that the Service, as a government agency, has an obligation to the general public it serves to consider
its actions that, in conjunction with the proposed rule, will affect all of the public, including those that engage
in OHV recreation. There are no areas to which these activities can be relocated or restricted. 



Service Response: 

Protection measures were implemented by the BLM in 1988 through its Rangewide Plan to reduce OHV use throughout the
range of the desert tortoise in category I and II habitats. As stated in the Draft Economic Impact Analysis, in its off-highway
users guide, California listed 24 OHV recreational areas managed by Federal, State, and other agencies in Imperial,
Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Four sites in the guide lie just outside proposed CHUs. Critical habitat
designation as proposed will not affect OHV use at these four sites. The other three States also offer areas for use
by OHV enthusiasts. 



Issue 30: 

One letter stated that hiking, camping, and birdwatching are listed in the proposed rule as examples of non-consumptive
uses. All of these activities necessitate a vehicle, in most instances off of a paved road, therefore, acting as OHVs.
Also, OHV activities are not ``commercial,'' but rather ``recreational.'' The Service should reevaluate this classification.




Service Response: 

Any use of vehicles off of designated roads and trails, for whatever the reason, can negatively impact the desert ecosystem.
The Service is not singling out organized OHV user groups in this assessment. However, the actions of hiking, camping,
and birdwatching, provided they do not involve use of vehicles off of designated roads and trails, are not likely to
adversely modify critical habitat. The Service recognizes that most recreational activity is not commercial. However,
most OHV races involve profits for the promoters, which is considered a commercial enterprise. 



Issue 31: 

Many respondents were concerned that designation of critical habitat would restrict all motorized access into these
areas. Some stated that OHV recreation and desert tortoise protection are not mutually exclusive.

Service Response:

 The Service anticipates that, although Federal land managers may close some roads as a result of critical habitat
designation, there will still be opportunities for scenic touring and other motorized uses on designated roads and
trails within CHUs. 



Issue 32: 

One letter stated that the management decision to set aside millions of acres violates the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act because it exceeds 100,000 acres and requires approval of Congress within 90 days thereafter. Therefore,
the designation of critical habitat has no force and effect. 



Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat is not a land withdrawal nor a land management action, but rather an action required
by section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. Land-use actions authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies
must undergo section 7 consultation, whereby the Service will determine if such actions are likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of the desert tortoise or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. Exclusion of
activities is not automatic upon the designation of critical habitat. 



Issue 33: 

One letter stated that designation of critical habitat may severely limit the ability of State game agencies to travel
off-highway to develop wildlife enhancement projects involving construction of roads or other facilities. 



Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat will not prohibit construction and maintenance of wildlife developments. Each
such development will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis through section 7 consultation between the Federal land
management agency and the Service. Although the land management agency may restrict off-road travel within critical
habitat, delivery of construction materials can most often be accomplished by other means, such as by foot, horseback,
or helicopter. 



Issue 34: 

Some letters recommended that areas that have traditionally been heavily used for recreation should be excluded,
as enforcement will be costly and ineffective. 



Service Response: 

The Service has included those areas containing constituent elements consistent with recommendations in the Draft
Recovery Plan. In the final rule, the Service, where practicable, has deleted areas that do not contain constituent
elements. No such information was provided for the recreation areas described. Land management agencies can consider
these recreation areas during their establishment of recovery areas for desert tortoises.

Issue 35: 

Several people were concerned that designation of critical habitat would preclude the recreational use of lands
that their families have used for generations, and they strongly opposed its designation. 



Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat is not synonymous with setting aside wilderness, locking up the lands within, or
prohibiting all uses. The Service anticipates that the land management agencies will designate roads and trails
within critical habitat, and that they will close some roads that are secondary and not necessary for access to private
lands or mines. Also, designation of critical habitat could increase certain types of recreational use. Many people
enjoy areas that show fewer signs of human activity. Activities considered not likely to adversely affect critical
habitat include hunting, picnicking, casual horseback riding (on designated roads and trails), camping, birdwatching,
bike riding (on designated roads and trails), hiking, and motor vehicle use on designated roads. 



Issue 36: 

Some local agencies and utility companies were concerned that designation of critical habitat would affect their
ability to access, use, and maintain existing facilities, rights-of-way, and fee property. Some stated that existing
utility corridors should be excluded from critical habitat designation. Several agencies were concerned that critical
habitat designation would either exclude or significantly increase the cost of future public works projects. 



Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat should not interfere with on-going maintenance of existing roads and utilities.
These structures do not normally contain primary constituent elements, and they would, therefore, not be affected
by the designation. Routine maintenance operations on existing pipelines, buried fiber-optic lines, and electrical
transmission line rights-of-way are generally covered under existing section 7 consultations and are not likely
to constitute adverse modification of critical habitat. Any expansion, addition, or modification within the rights-of-way
or fee property will be subject to section 7 consultation if authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal agency.
Through such consultation, the Service will determine if the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of the desert tortoise or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. 



Issue 37: 

Several individuals requested that the final rule contain a discussion of how CHUs will be managed. Other members
of the public were concerned that critical habitat designation forces creation of a management plan, establishes
population goals, or prescribes specific management actions.

Service Response:

 The designation of critical habitat does not create a management plan for the listed species. It is the responsibility
of land management agencies to ensure that actions they authorize, fund, or carry out do not destroy or adversely modify
designated critical habitat. Several Federal agencies charged with management of the public's lands are preparing
or already implementing management plans that include actions that will benefit the desert tortoise. Development
of such land use plans should focus on recommendations provided in the desert tortoise recovery plan. 



Issue 38:

 Some people commented that the Service should prepare an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) on the proposed designation of critical habitat prior to publishing a final rule.




Service Response:

 The decision in 

Pacific Legal Foundation

 v. 

Andrus,

 675 F.2d 829 (6th Cir. 1981), held that as a matter of law, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required for listings
under the Act. The decision noted that preparing Environmental Impact Statements on listing actions does not further
the goals of NEPA or the Act. The Service believes that, under the reasoning of this decision, preparing an Environmental
Impact Statement on the proposed critical habitat designation would not further the goals of NEPA or the Act and is
not legally required. NEPA documentation will be required for BLM plans and activities that involve critical habitat.
The Service published a notice outlining this determination on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). The decision in 

Douglas County 

v. 

Babbitt,

 810 F.Supp. 1470 (D. Ore. 1992), which held that the Service must comply with NEPA in designating critical habitat,
has been stayed pending appeal of the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 



Issue 39:

 One letter stated that final designation should include more definitive guidelines and specific examples for measuring
adverse modification of critical habitat. 



Service Response:

 It is difficult for the Service to anticipate all activities that may be proposed within critical habitat. In addition,
the Service should avoid prejudging the outcome of section 7 consultations. The Service will make a determination,
on a case-by-case basis, if the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species or destroy
or adversely modify critical habitat. 



Issue 40:

 A number of organizations and individuals requested that the Service include within critical habitat the proposed
site for the low-level radioactive waste repository (LLRWR) in Ward Valley (Chemehuevi CHU). Commenters provided
a variety of reasons for inclusion of the LLRWR site, including potential threats to the desert tortoise should the
LLRWR leak radionuclide-contaminated fluids, leachate contamination of the aquifer underlying the LLRWR site,
the potential for contamination of the Colorado River and subsequent adverse effects to listed species that inhabit
the Colorado River, and the alleged poor operating record of the proposed licensee. Some commenters stated that allowing
the proposed LLRWR in Ward Valley would violate sections 2, 4(b)(2), and 7(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act. 



Service Response:

 The Service has determined that the Ward Valley LLRWR facility site should be included in this critical habitat designation.
Following designation of critical habitat, all current activities for which a Federal agency maintains discretionary
action must undergo reinitiation of consultation to analyze whether or not they are likely to destroy or adversely
modify critical habitat. As a result, the BLM will need to reinitiate consultation under section 7 to determine if
its proposed transfer of lands to the State of California for the proposed LLRWR facility is likely to result in the
adverse modification of critical habitat. 



Issue 41:

 One group stated that the Service must consider the cultural value to native peoples of lands within critical habitat.
Specifically, these individuals stated that the cultural values of Ward Valley should be considered in the decision
to include or exclude from critical habitat the proposed LLRWR site in Ward Valley.

<TEXT>
 



Service Response: 

The Service designated critical habitat based on biological information regarding whether or not an area contains
the primary constituent elements of desert tortoise habitat, after taking into account the economic costs of designating
that area. Although the Service recognizes that Ward Valley is important culturally to indigenous peoples of the
region, the Act does not address inclusion of areas within critical habitat for cultural reasons. 


Issue 42: 

Some respondents stated that critical habitat should not be designated because species like the tortoise that cannot
adapt should be allowed to become extinct. 


Service Response: 

In section 2 of the Act, Findings, Purposes, and Policy, Congress found that numerous species of fish, wildlife, and
plants had become extinct and that other species had become so depleted in numbers that these species were in danger
of, or threatened with, extinction due to a lack of concern for their conservation. Furthermore, Congress found that
these species of fish, wildlife, and plants are intrinsically valuable to the Nation and its people. These findings
are the basis of the Endangered Species Act, the purpose of which is to conserve threatened and endangered species
and the ecosystems on which they depend. The designation of critical habitat is one mechanism provided under the Act
to facilitate the recovery of listed species. It would be contrary to the Act and the mission of the Service to allow
the desert tortoise to become extinct without taking all reasonable preventative actions. 


Issue 43: 

Some respondents stated that the Service had not protected enough critical habitat, because even full implementation
of the draft recovery plan gives the tortoise only a 50/50 chance of surviving 500 years. 


Service Response: 

The CHUs proposed by the Service were based on recommendations provided in the Draft Recovery Plan because those areas
are necessary for the recovery of the desert tortoise. Some areas are larger than those recommended in the Draft Recovery
Plan based on new biological information. The Draft Recovery Plan pointed out that implementation of recovery actions
can increase the probability of survival of the species. 


Issue 44: 

One respondent stated that designation of critical habitat above that required or suggested by the Act as mitigation
against threatened additional litigation is improper. Section 4(b)(2) of the Act defines the methodology to be used
in the determination of critical habitat, as exemplified by the actions of the Recovery Team. However, the boundaries
of the proposed CHUs extend beyond that recommended by the Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan for DWMAs. The Service should
not arbitrarily designate additional acreage that is ``unsuitable'' or excessive. Critical habitat should not
include the entire range of the species. The Service neither identifies nor makes available the content or source
of the additional information upon which these expansions are based so that the reviewing public has an opportunity
to base its comments upon the same information. The proposed rule increased the number of DWMAs in California from
four to eight. 


Service Response: 

The Service based its designation of critical habitat on biological information and recovery recommendations provided
by the Draft Recovery Plan. The Draft Recovery Plan provided general areas in which recovery is necessary to ensure
maintenance of viable populations of desert tortoises in each of the six recovery units. The Act requires that critical
habitat boundaries be defined by legal metes and bounds. To refine the Draft Recovery Plan recommendations, the Service
held regional meetings of desert tortoise biologists and agency personnel during preparation of the proposed rule.
Information gathered during these meetings was evaluated and incorporated into the critical habitat boundaries,
which were generally drawn to the nearest section line. Final designation of critical habitat also included an economic
analysis of the costs of designating critical habitat. 
The Draft Recovery Plan recommends eight DWMAs within four recovery units in California. These include Chemehuevi
DWMA (Northern Colorado Recovery Unit); Chuckwalla and part of Joshua Tree DWMAs (Eastern Colorado Recovery Unit);
Ord-Rodman, Superior-Cronese, Fremont-Kramer, and part of Joshua Tree DWMAs (Western Mojave Recovery Unit); and
Fenner and Ivanpah DWMAs (Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit). The Fenner DWMA is incorporated into the Piute-Eldorado
CHU, which extends into Nevada. Joshua Tree National Monument, although still considered important for recovery,
was not designated as critical habitat because such designation would not afford the desert tortoise any additional
benefit due to the National Park Service's ecosystem management of the area. However, the BLM land north of the Joshua
Tree National Monument was designated critical habitat, and was given the new name of the Pinto Mountains CHU. 


Issue 45: 

One letter disagreed with the use of recovery units as legally and biologically accepted subpopulations of the Mojave
population. Behavioral, physiological, and ecological uniqueness have not been linked to the genetic and morphologic
variability described for Nevada populations. The bounds of adaptive plasticity for the desert tortoise have not
been determined.

Service Response: 

The Service based the critical habitat designation on recommendations provided in the Draft Recovery Plan, which
is the most comprehensive source of information on the desert tortoise at this time. Should the recommendations in
the final recovery plan differ significantly from that of the draft, the Service will reevaluate the critical habitat
designation. 


Issue 46: 

One respondent stated that the proposed critical habitat designation focused attention only on activities that
impair vegetation, soil structure, or other physical attributes of the habitat, and considered this analysis to
be too narrow. The criteria should also include rectifying biological imbalances that result from habitat alteration
(e.g., ravens and non-native plant species). Feral predators, such as dogs, should be considered in the same way as
feral horses and burros. Surface disturbances caused by such activities as utility rights-of-way, road construction,
and real estate development should be included. 


Service Response: 

The Service already addresses those actions that may increase feral predators or ravens through section 7 of the Act
to determine if such actions are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise. The Service
agrees that habitat imbalances negatively affect desert tortoises and should be avoided within critical habitat.
Such imbalances often result in increased exotic species, such as weedy vegetation, and have contributed toward
the increase of ravens in the Mojave Desert. The final rule discusses road and utility construction and issuance of
Federal housing loans as requiring consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act to determine, on a case-by-case basis,
whether or not such proposed actions are likely to adversely modify or destroy critical habitat. 


Issue 47: 

Several letters stated that desert tortoises are not native to the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit (nor CHU); they
were imported into the area by humans. Therefore, critical habitat designation is really land acquisition, not a
designation of natural habitat. 


Service Response: 

Listing of the Mojave population of desert tortoises as a threatened species affords it protection under the Act,
regardless of speculation on the origin of populations. 


Issue 48: 

Several commenters pointed out that areas proposed as critical habitat within the Upper Virgin River CHU included
areas that do not have desert tortoises present (e.g., developed areas, high elevations). 


Service Response: 

The Service has used readily recognizable land features and legal descriptions to define the boundaries of desert
tortoise critical habitat. Only the land within those boundaries that is suitable desert tortoise habitat (i.e.,
contains the primary constituent elements) is treated as critical habitat. Although the Service has adjusted boundary
lines to exclude non-habitat to a great extent in this final designation, it remains mechanically impossible for
the Service to specifically identify all non-habitat by legal description, particularly because many of these lands
are less than 40 acres in size. Actions proposed within areas without the primary constituent elements of desert tortoise
habitat will not be subject to section 7 of the Act, unless such actions may affect nearby critical habitat. 
In the case of unoccupied, suitable desert tortoise habitat, the Act states clearly that areas in need of special management
(inside or outside of the current range of the species) can be included in designation of critical habitat. Recovery
of the desert tortoise within the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit is dependent upon maintenance and improvement
in the quantity, quality, and/or arrangement of habitat. 


Issue 49: 

One letter stated that critical habitat designated on Tribal land in Utah is insufficient to support a viable population
of desert tortoises.

Service Response: 

Population viability analysis is appropriate only at the population level. Therefore, the Service does not evaluate
population viability of separate portions of a CHU. Although it requires more intensive management as it is a smaller
population, the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit, as recommended by the Desert Tortoise Recovery Team, is a viable
and recoverable population of desert tortoises. The Tribal lands within Utah are considered part of this recovery
unit. The Upper Virgin River CHU corresponds to this recovery unit. 


Issue 50: 

Several letters stated that the importance of mining and grazing in rural communities was not adequately addressed
in the economic analysis. 


Service Response: 

The smallest subdivision with standard, meaningful economic data normally is an individual county; thus, economic
impacts are based upon county data for regional effects, whereas statewide or nationwide data and effects are addressed
only if they become economically relevant. 


Issue 51: 

A few people were concerned that inclusion of their private land within critical habitat boundaries would negate
Ft. Irwin's desire to purchase their land for future expansion, and they asked if the Service was going to compensate
them for their loss of revenue. In addition, some people submitted comments asking the government to compensate them
for reductions in land values due to their inclusion within critical habitat boundaries. 


Service Response: 

The National Training Center at Ft. Irwin revised its expansion proposal in response to the Service's concerns for
desert tortoises prior to the proposal of critical habitat.
Therefore, designation of critical habitat would not affect private lands that were in the original proposed expansion
area. In the future, the Federal government may pursue acquisition of private lands within the CHUs on a willing seller/willing
buyer basis to further the conservation of the desert tortoise. 
Neither the Act nor any other law administered by the Service authorizes compensation for perceived decreases in
land value as suggested by the comments. Consequently, this issue is a matter for other agencies and Congress to consider.



Issue 52: 

Some respondents stated that the Service is underestimating economic impacts by separating impacts from the listing
process and the designation of critical habitat. The economic analysis addresses only incremental impacts associated
with designation of critical habitat and omits impacts resulting from previous management plans and consultations.



Service Response: 

The Endangered Species Act specifies that the listing of species should be based solely upon the best biological information
available. However, the Act specifies that the Service should consider economic and other relevant impacts in the
designation of critical habitat. Listing a species provides protection under the jeopardy standard and incidental
take; designating critical habitat provides additional protection through the adverse modification standard.
These are intended to be separate standards to be addressed through section 7 consultation. The economic analysis
clearly distinguishes between the costs and benefits of these independent and incremental actions and is not an effort
to underestimate costs. The total cost of conserving the desert tortoise is greater than the cost of designating critical
habitat alone, and it includes the costs of prior tortoise protection measures under other laws and costs resulting
from listing under the Act, as well as the cost of designating critical habitat. 


Issue 53: 

A few respondents stated that the section 7 decisions to restrict grazing are currently under litigation and a stay
of these decisions has been issued. Therefore, the economic analysis should be based on current (prelisting) grazing
practices. 


Service Response: 

The Service based its economic baseline on the biological opinions rendered by the Service and the decisions issued
by the BLM on livestock grazing in desert tortoise habitat. The Interior Board of Land Appeals may review land use decisions
by Interior Department agencies, but lacks jurisdiction needed to review biological opinions issued by the Service.
Therefore, the Interior Board of Land Appeals Judge's stay of these decisions does not alter the economic baseline.

Issue 54: 

One respondent stated that no attempt to quantify the benefits of critical habitat designation was made by the Service.
This is needed to balance the costs, even if found not be significant. The Economic Analysis (page 60) states, ``To
properly compare benefits and costs, the full range of each must be considered.'' The study fails to do this; therefore,
the existing study cannot be used to exclude any of the proposed critical habitat areas. 


Service Response: 

Conducting a quantitative study of species benefits is a costly and lengthy process that was not possible within the
court-mandated deadlines. Even with results of such a study, allocating the benefits of preservation and recovery
of an endangered species between the various actions required is an extremely difficult task. If species preservation
were accomplished entirely through designation of critical habitat, then the full value of benefits could be attributed
to that action. Typically, however, preservation is achieved with multiple interactive management actions (e.g.,
federally listing as threatened or endangered, protection under State laws), each of which may be essential to recovery
and no one of which can be singled out as the sole means by which a species is preserved or recovery attained. Given the
data available, and without a clear delineation of the results of each management alternative, it is not possible
to disaggregate the sum of benefits to identify that portion directly attributable to critical habitat designation.



Issue 55: 

One letter stated that the economic analysis does not address the impact of potential delays in both maintenance and
new construction caused by designation of critical habitat. 


Service Response: 

Actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies are already subject to the jeopardy standard
pursuant to section 7 of the Act, if such actions may affect desert tortoises. These actions require consultation
between the action agency and the Service to determine whether or not they are likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the desert tortoise. With designation of critical habitat, the Service will also determine whether or not such
actions are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Both assessments will be made concurrently through
consultation between the Federal action agency and the Service; therefore, designation of critical habitat will
not result in any additional project delays. The Act requires the Service to issue a biological opinion within 135
days of the receipt of a request for formal section 7 consultation from an action agency. Therefore, the requirement
for Federal agencies to insure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or adversely
modify critical habitat would not result in project delays. 


Issue 56:

 One group stated that, given the long time frame necessary for recovery of the desert tortoise, the economic analysis
should have considered the long-term effects of known or foreseeable projects. 


Service Response: 

Without knowing the details of future projects, the Service cannot know how or to what extent such projects may affect
critical habitat or vice versa. The Service evaluated economic information provided on existing projects to determine
if the benefits of excluding areas outweighed the benefits of designating those areas as critical habitat. The Service
was unable to assign a cost to those projects that may or may not be proposed within critical habitat in the future. 


Issue 57:

 One group stated that the economic analysis of the effects of removing grazing from Federal lands was inadequate and
understates the importance of grazing to the region's economy. Ranchers act as land managers for the Federal government.
By eliminating ranching, the Federal government would have to expend additional monies for management. In addition,
range improvements, associated with grazing on Federal lands, improve overall habitat quality by providing water
sources and facilitating effective forage use.

Service Response:

 According to a 1991 study by the GAO, the costs of administering the livestock grazing program by the BLM and Department
of Agriculture (predator control and rangeland grasshopper control) far exceed the fees derived from the ranchers
for their AUMs. 



Issue 58:

 One letter stated that the critical habitat economic analysis should have included the costs associated with implementation
of the recovery plan. A 2006 date for delisting was selected in an arbitrary and capricious manner and designed to limit
the amount of funding the Recovery Team had to report in the Draft Recovery Plan. 



Service Response:

 Implementation of the recovery plan for the desert tortoise is not a cost attributable to designation of critical
habitat. The Draft Recovery Plan was prepared prior to proposing critical habitat and is mandated by the Endangered
Species Act whether or not a species has designated critical habitat. Therefore, its implementation can be considered
a cost of listing the desert tortoise as threatened versus a cost associated with designation of critical habitat.




Issue 59:

 The DOD installations stated that the economic analysis failed to evaluate the costs to the public of relocating base
activities or potential base closures that might result from inclusion in critical habitat. 



Service Response:

 After careful consideration of the activities that occur on the military installations, the Service concluded that
designation of critical habitat should not result in the closure of military bases in the region. The Service maintains
that most training conducted on the bases can be compatible with proper tortoise management and has concluded that
concerns about military bases being rendered unusable due to designation of critical habitat are overstated. Areas
that include existing facilities, or that have been highly degraded (e.g., high-impact bombing ranges), do not contain
constituent elements of tortoise habitat. Therefore, they do not constitute critical habitat. Expansion or relocation
of facilities or activities that may destroy or adversely modify critical habitat within a CHU on a military base (e.g.,
relocation of high impact bombing targets) would require section 7 consultation to determine if the relocation is
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.




Issue 60:

 The Service should, on economic grounds, exclude the proposed site of the LLRWR facility in Ward Valley.

Service Response:

 The Service is aware that including the Ward Valley site in critical habitat may threaten a portion of the investment
made in siting the LLRWR facility and may result in potentially significant costs for the State of California. However,
after considering these potential economic impacts, the Service has determined that the area should not be excluded
from critical habitat designation. 


Issue 61:

 Several letters suggested that designation of critical habitat would result in taking of private property. 


Service Response:

 The courts have held that the mere enactment of laws that may result in restrictions on property does not necessarily
equate to a taking of property for which compensation is required (

Hodel 

v. 

Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association,

 452 U.S. 264, 295 (1981), 

Agins 

v. 

Tiburon, 

447 U.S. 255, 260-263 (1980)). Therefore, the Service concludes that publication of a final rule designating
critical habitat for the desert tortoise does not equate to a taking of property requiring just compensation. 
Recognizing that governmental regulation involves adjustment of rights for the public good, the U.S. Supreme Court
has found that a regulation that curtails the most profitable use of one's property, resulting in a reduction in value
or limitations on use likewise does not necessarily equate to a taking (

Andrus

 v. 

Allard

, 444 U.S. 51, 66 (1979), 

Agins,

 447 U.S. at 262, 

Hodel, 

452 U.S. at 296). Where a regulation denies a property owner the economically viable use of his or her property, then
a taking will likely occur (

Agins,

 447 U.S. at 260). However, where regulations do not categorically prohibit use but merely regulate the conditions
under which such use may occur, and do not regulate alternative uses, then no taking occurs (

Hodel,

 452 U.S. at 296). With the designation of critical habitat, a property owner is not denied the economical viable use
of his or her land. Use of land is not categorically prohibited but rather certain restrictions may be imposed upon
Federal agency actions that may result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. As such, the
Service concludes that designation of critical habitat will not result in a taking of private property. 

Furthermore, a property owner must establish that a ``concrete controversy'' exists before the court may even reach
the merits of a takings claim (

Hodel, 

452 U.S. at 294, 

Agins, 

447 U.S. at 260). The property owner must show a specific and real impact to specific properties before judicial resolution
of a takings claim is made (

MacDonald, Sommer, and Frates 

v. 

Yolo County, 

477 U.S. 340, 348-349, 

Agins, 

447 U.S. at 260). As applied to critical habitat designation, a claim of takings of property would not be ripe for judicial
resolution until the consultation process is completed and exemption from the Endangered Species Committee is denied.
Even then, it is highly unlikely that a takings claim would be successful because designation of critical habitat
does not categorically prohibit use of the property owner's land. Therefore, the Service has concluded that designation
of critical habitat for the desert tortoise does not pose significant takings implications. 



Issue 62:

 One letter stated that designation of State lands as critical habitat violates the ``trust'' responsibility of the
Federal government to the States. The main purpose of these State lands is to provide funding for the State's schools.




Service Response:

 Critical habitat designation will not affect State lands unless proposed actions on these lands are authorized,
funded, or carried out by Federal agencies. Such actions would then be subject to consultation if they may affect the
desert tortoise or its habitat pursuant to section 7 of the Act. As with private lands, State lands are already subject
to prohibitions of section 9 of the Act, which prohibit unauthorized take of listed species. 



Issue 63:

 Several groups stated that conferencing on projects in proposed critical habitat is illegal because the desert tortoise
is already listed and because critical habitat has been proposed years beyond the statutory deadline for such designation.

Service Response:

 Section 7(a)(4) of the Act and 50 CFR 402.10 of the regulations require Federal agencies to confer with the Service
on any action that is likely to result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. With designation
of critical habitat, Federal agencies will be required to enter into formal consultation with the Service for any
actions that may affect desert tortoises or their critical habitat. 



Issue 64:

 One letter stated that the public did not receive an adequate opportunity to review the maps upon which the proposed
rule was based because the maps provided in the 

Federal Register

 notice were too small to be useful. 



Service Response:

 The Service provided opportunities for the public to review maps at a scale of 1:100,000 at each of three public hearings
and made the maps available at the field offices located in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. Due to the court-mandated
time frame for development of the proposed rule, the Service was unable to provide copies of these larger-scaled maps
to other agencies. 



Issue 65:

 There was an insufficient amount of time for comment and review between the critical habitat proposal and final designation.




Service Response:

 The Service provided 60 days for public comment on the critical habitat proposal, which included three public hearings.
The schedule for designation of critical habitat follows a stipulation and order of dismissal filed on August 3, 1993,
in two lawsuits filed against the Service (

Natural Resources Defense Council, et al.,

 v. 

Bruce Babbitt et al.

 and 

Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) a threatened species; et al.,

 v. 

Manual Lujan, Jr.

). This court-mandated schedule requires publication of the final critical habitat rule by December 15, 1993. This
short time frame for finalizing the rule does not allow for an extension of the public comment period. 



Issue 66:

 One letter stated that Tribal economic costs resulting from critical habitat designation were not considered in
the proposal. 



Service Response:

 For a 60-day period after the draft economic analysis was made available to the public, the Service collected and considered
other responses from State and Federal agencies, private land holders, the Tribe, and other entities regarding economic
effects they might experience from the proposed designation. All responses that identified specific economic impacts
were considered in completing the final economic analysis. During the public comment period, the Tribe commented
that the proposed designation ``could eliminate or reduce economic development and other opportunities,'' but
did not identify or describe specific effects that allowed estimation of economic impacts. 



Issue 67:

 The Aerojet-General Corporation and Wyle Laboratories have requested that the 42,800 acres that they have purchased
(28,800 acres) and leased (14,000 acres) from the BLM be excluded from critical habitat designation. The basis for
the request was the Environmental Stipulations contained in the Land Exchange and Lease Agreements signed pursuant
to the Nevada-Florida Land Exchange Authorization Act of 1988, which established a detailed plan for the conservation
of the desert tortoise on these lands. In addition Aerojet-General Corporation felt that statements that critical
habitat does not affect private lands are misleading, because designation of critical habitat will affect these
lands and their future use either through the section 7 process or through the section 10 permit process. 



Service Response:

 The Service recognizes the desert tortoise management plan for this area but does not believe that it adequately addresses
the potential impacts of the transmission lines that are proposed through Coyote Spring Valley. Therefore, the Service
has included this area in the designation of critical habitat. Whether or not critical habitat is designated, lands
containing desert tortoises and their habitat are still subject to section 9 of the Act, which prohibits unauthorized
take of listed species. The only avenues for authorizing take that is incidental to otherwise lawful activities are
the section 7 process for activities that are authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies, and the section
10(a)(1)(B) permitting process for non-Federal actions on private or State lands. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement, as defined
under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations
adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). 



Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior has determined that
the final rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within CHUs,
significant economic impacts will not result from the critical habitat designation. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this designation.
Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 



Takings Implications Assessment 



The Service has analyzed the potential takings implications of designating critical habitat for the desert tortoise
in a Takings Implications Assessment prepared pursuant to requirements of Executive Order 12630, ``Governmental
Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' The Takings Implications Assessment
concludes that the designation does not pose significant takings implications.
