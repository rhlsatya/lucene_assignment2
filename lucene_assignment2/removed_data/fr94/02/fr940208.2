Twelve Lakes Stabilization Project, Wasatch-Cache National Forest, Summit County, UT


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement on a proposal to stabilize Big Elk, Crystal, Duck,
Fire, Island, Long, Marjorie, Pot, Star, Teapot, Wall, and Weir Lake reservoirs located in non-motorized backcountry
adjacent to the Mirror Lake Highway. These lakes will no longer be used for water storage purposes. Restoration of
watershed resources, fishery and wildlife habitat, and previous recreation impacts will occur. This project is
mitigation for lost fishery and recreational opportunities related to the construction of Jordanelle Reservoir
(Central Utah Project).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Wasatach-Cache National Forest is the lead agency.




The Kamas Ranger District invites comments on the proposed action and alternatives. Scoping will include written,
phone or personal comments. No meetings are scheduled. District employees will meet with any person who requests
a meeting.

The decisions to be made include whether or not to stabilize these lakes and if so at what lake surface elevation and
what, if any, recreation and natural resource restoration will be necessary.

Preliminary issues include cost, fishery benefits, roadless character, wetlands, cultural resources, potential
impacts of stablization attracting more recreational use to these lakes.

Preliminary alternatives include No Action, stabilization at natural lake levels, low hazard dam levels, and levels
above low hazard dam elevations.

A 404 Dredge and Fill permit from the Army Corps of Engineers and Utah State Stream Alternation permits will be necessary.

The Responsible Official is Melissa Blackwell, District Ranger, Kamas Ranger District.

Estimated dates of availability: Draft EIS August 1994, final EIS November 1994.

The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful,
comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy
of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).

In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v.

 NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not
raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement.

 (9th Circuit, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v.

 Harris,

 490 S. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final.

<DOCTITLE>Butch Creek Timber Sale; Idaho Panhandle National Forests, Pend Oreille County, Washington.</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the draft environmental impact statement for proposed activities in the Butch Creek project
area.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The notice is hereby given that the Forest Service has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) documenting
the environmental effects that proposed timber harvesting and watershed improvement activities would have in the
Butch Creek project area. The area is located approximately 15 air miles northwest of Priest River, Idaho, and is approximately
7,270 acres in size.




Public participation is important. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any time prior to the decision,
however, it is very important that public comment be made available to the Forest Service during review of this Draft
EIS. After a 45-day public comment period, the comments received will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service
in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by June, 1994.
The Forest Service will respond to the comments received from the DEIS in the FEIS.

The District Ranger is the responsible official for this EIS, and will make a decision regarding this proposal considering
the comments and responses, environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS, and applicable laws, regulations,
and policies. The decision and reasons for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A very specific proposed action was developed for the area that includes timber harvest, reforestation and watershed
rehabilitation activities. The proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action were developed within the
framework of Ecosystem Management. This approach considers the management of all resources on large land areas with
emphasis on sustaining the ecological systems present.



Five alternatives were developed, including a No-Action Alternative. Alternative C is the alternative preferred
by the Forest Service. Under Alternative C, approximately 4.5 million board feet of green, dead and dying timber would
be harvested within 23 harvest units. Harvest methods include commercial thinning, overstory removal, group selection,
individual tree selection, sanitation/salvage, shelterwood with reserves and seed tree with reserves. Skyline
and tractor yarding methods would be utilized to harvest trees within these areas. In addition to these timber management
activities, approximately 69 acres would be precommercially thinned.

Access to these proposed harvest areas would require 0.9 mile of new road construction, 8.7 miles of road reconstruction
and 0.8 mile of road reconditioning. All of these roads would be closed, either immediately following the timber harvesting
or after the post sale activities (such as slash burning and planting) have been completed. The majority of the newly
constructed roads would be obliterated immediately after the timber is harvested while the majority of the reconstructed
roads would be closed following the post sale activities.
In addition to these road activities, improvements to the existing Forest Service Road 305 would be made over an 8-mile
stretch within the project area to reduce the amount of sediment reaching the adjacent stream. To further improve
the watershed conditions, structures would be placed into some headwater streams.
Management activities would be administered by the Priest Lake Ranger District of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests
in Bonner County, Idaho. This DEIS will tier to the Forest Plan (September 1987) which provides the overall guidance
(Goals, Objectives, Standards and Guidelines, and Management Area direction) in achieving the desired future condition
for this area.



HOW TO RESPOND: 

The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the issues and management opportunities in the area being
analyzed. To ensure that these comments are considered in the final decision, comments must be postmarked or received
within 45 days from the date that this notice is published in the 

Federal Register

. Commenters should include: (1) Name, address, telephone number, organization represented, if any; (2) title of
the document on which the comment is being submitted (Butch Creek DEIS); and (3) specific concerns and supporting
reasons for the District Ranger to consider. Copies of the Record of Decision will be mailed to those people who have
submitted comments either before or during the comment period and to those who request a copy.

Settlement Agreement and Order 
 


1. Walgreen Co. (hereinafter, ``Walgreen''), a corporation, enters into this Settlement Agreement (hereinafter,
``Agreement'') with the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and agrees to the entry of the Order described
herein. The purpose of the Agreement and Order is to settle the staff's allegations that Walgreen knowingly caused
the export of certain banned hazardous substances, namely toys, in violation of section 14(d) of the Federal Hazardous
Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1273(d), which is a prohibited act under section 4(i) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263(i).

 


I. Jurisdiction 
 


2. The Commission has jurisdiction over Walgreen and the subject matter of this Settlement Agreement pursuant to
section 30(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (hereinafter, ``CPSA''), 15 U.S.C. 2079(a), and sections 2 (f)(1)(D)

II. The Parties



3. The ``staff'' is the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent regulatory commission of
the United States established pursuant to section 4 of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2053.
4. Walgreen is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois with its principal corporate
offices located at 200 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Walgreen is a retail drug chain and is engaged, in part,
in the business of importing and selling domestically, children's toys and novelty items.


III. Allegations of the Staff


5. On June 2, 1992, Commission field staff collected samples of Walgreen's ``Toy Center Musical Phone,'' item 

#

874409, for evaluation under the FHSA.
6. In the staff's letter of July 8, 1992, Walgreen was advised that these toys are intended for children under three
years of age and are subject to the Small Parts regulation at 16 CFR part 501. The toy phone had battery and antenna components
that separated when tested under the use and abuse procedures outlined in 16 CFR 1500.52(c) and (f). The battery antenna
components fit entirely within the small parts cylinder described at 16 CFR 1500.4. Therefore, the toys present a
choking hazard to children under three years of age. As a result, the toy phones are hazardous substances as defined
in section 2(f)(1)(D) and (s) of the FHSA and the regulations at 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9), and are banned hazardous substances
under section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA.
7. In that same letter, Walgreen was supplied with the Regulated Products Handbook and referred to chapter 6. The letter
and the handbook described, among other things, the procedures that must be followed if a firm elects to export banned
products.
8. In Walgreen's response of September 1, 1992, they described their ``stop sales'' activity and informed Commission
staff that the returned goods would be ``held for return to the vendor.''
9. On September 30, 1992, the Commission's Central Regional office received a letter from a firm, Atico Limited of
Miami, Florida which represented itself as Walgreen's agent for disposal of these toys. Atico claimed to have revised
the product so that it would comply with the FHSA and included revised samples for evaluation.
10. The staff's letter dated November 3, 1992, informed Atico that the revised toys were still not in compliance with
the FHSA, and asked again for a final disposition of Walgreen's stock of these violative products. The letter again
outlined the correct procedures to follow should Walgreen elect to reexport the products.
11. In January 1993, the staff was contacted by counsel, purportedly representing Atico, asking for additional guidance
on the Commission's export requirements. He specifically inquired about possible export to Paraguay. The staff
told him that Walgreen was the importer and should file a notice of export with the Commission.
12. In a phone conversation held April 26, 1993, the CPSC staff again asked Walgreen about the disposition of the violative
toys. Walgreen advised that Atico would be handling the export on its behalf.
13. In a phone conversation held on April 27, 1993, Walgreen acknowledged that it had not filed the Notice to Export.

14. Subsequently, the staff learned that Walgreen had shipped 1,758 cartons of these toys back to its foreign supplier
on March 29, 1993. The Commission never received the required Notice of Export from Walgreen or Atico.
15. Section 14(d) of the FHSA requires, in pertinent part, that any person who elects to export a banned hazardous product
shall notify the Commission of its intent to export at least 30 days prior to the date of exportation.
16. Walgreen's failure to provide the Commission with advance notice of its intent to export these toys is a violation
of section 14(d) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1273(d), and is a prohibited act under section 4(i) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 


IV. Response of Walgreen


17. Walgreen denies the allegations of the staff that it has knowingly introduced or caused the introduction into
commerce of the aforesaid banned hazardous toys, that it knowingly failed to comply with export notification requirements
of the FHSA, or that it violated the FHSA in any way.

V. Agreement of the Parties


18. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over Walgreen and the subject matter of this Settlement
Agreement and Order under the following acts: Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 

et seq.

), and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1261 

et seq.
19. Walgreen agrees to pay to the Commission a civil penalty in the amount of fifty thousand and 00/100 dollars ($50,000)
within twenty (20) days after service of the Final Order of the Commission accepting this Settlement Agreement. This
payment is made in full settlement of the staff's allegations set forth in paragraphs five through sixteen above that
Walgreen violated the FHSA.
20. The Commission does not make any determination that Walgreen knowingly violated the FHSA. The Commission and
Walgreen agree that this Agreement is entered into for the purposes of settlement only.
21. Upon final acceptance of this Settlement Agreement by the Commission and issuance of the Final Order, Walgreen
knowingly, voluntarily and completely, waives any rights it may have in this matter (1) to an administrative or judicial
hearing, (2) to judicial review or other challenge or contest of the validity of the Commission's actions, (3) to a
determination by the Commission as to whether Walgreen failed to comply with the FHSA as aforesaid, and (4) to a statement
of findings of fact and conclusions of law.
22. For purposes of section 6(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2055(b), this matter shall be treated as if a complaint had been
issued; and, the Commission may publicize the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Order.
23. Upon provisional acceptance of this Settlement Agreement and Order by the Commission, this Settlement Agreement
and Order shall be placed on the public record and shall be published in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with the procedures set forth in 16 CFR 1118.20(e)-(h). If the Commission does not receive any
written request not to accept the Settlement Agreement and Order within 15 days, the Settlement Agreement and Order
will be deemed finally accepted on the 16th day after the date it is published in the 

Federal Register

.
24. The parties further agree that the Commission shall issue the attached Order, incorporated herein by reference;
and that a violation of the Order shall subject Walgreen to appropriate legal action.
25. No agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in this Settlement Agreement
and Order may be used to vary or to contradict its terms.
26. The provisions of the Settlement Agreement and Order shall apply to Walgreen and each of its successors and assigns.

Final Programmatic Life-Cycle Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Proposed Action is to conduct research and development activities that would give the United States the capability
to produce and deploy an integrated, comprehensive theater missile defense. The Proposed Action is necessary to
improve the capability of the United States to defend its forward-deployed armed forces and its friends and allies
against hostile theater missiles in any foreign theater of operations. TMD consists of three components: (1) Active
Defense to destroy enemy missile in-flight; (2) Counterforce to destroy an enemy's ability to launch missiles and;
(3) Passive Defense to evade detection and otherwise enhance survival from missile attack. A network of command,
control, communications and intelligence (C

3

I) elements would support each of the components individually and provide a means of managing and integrating the
overall TMD system.




The EIS addresses, to the extent possible, the potential environmental impacts of the research, development and
testing, production, basing (not deployment), and eventual decommissioning of the proposed TMD components. It
also identifies any mitigation measures that could avoid or lessen those impacts. Environmental resource topics
evaluated include air quality, noise, surface and ground water quality, hazardous materials and wastes, electromagnetic
radiation, safety, land use, transportation, and biological and cultural resources.
Alternative to the Proposed Action analyzed in the EIS:
 Improve Active Defense Only_involving only Active Defense and related C

3

I research, development, and testing activities. TMD system improvements would only occur in the area of intercepting
and destroying in-flight theater missiles.
 Improve Counterforce Only_involving only Counterforce and related C

3

I research, development, and testing activities. TMD system improvements would only occur in the areas of detecting,
identifying, and destroying fixed and mobile launch platforms, support and storage facilities, and command and
control nodes.
 Improve Passive Defense Only_involving only Passive Defense and related C3I research, development, and
testing activities. TMD system improvements would occur in the area of camouflage, cover, and deception; hardening
of military assets; reductions in thermal, and electronic emissions; and mobility. 
 No-Action Alernative_no research and development activities, no testing activities, and no production
or basing would be undertaken that would result in an integrated and comprehensive TMD system. Normal improvements
and maintenance of existing system (i.e., aircraft, missile, radars) would occur to assure their performance against
traditional combatant forces.

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District is conducting a Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) to address
the long term operational and management needs for the dredging and dredged material disposal needs for the Federally
Authorized Savannah Harbor Navigation Project. Savannah Harbor is located approximately 75 miles south of Charleston,
South Carolina, and 120 miles north of Jacksonville, Florida. Savannah Harbor includes the lower 21.3 miles of the
Savannah River. An additional 11.4 miles of channel is maintained from the mouth of the harbor across the bar to the
Atlantic Ocean. Annual maintenance of the Savannah Harbor Navigation Project requires dredging and disposal of
approximately 6 million cubic yards of material.



The LTMS for the Savannah Harbor Navigation Project will focus on sound economic and environmental alternatives
for the management of dredging and dredged material disposal for maintaining the Federally Authorized Navigation
channel and additional material dredged under Department of the Army permits. Various alternative dredging schedules
and dredging disposal schemes will be examined in an effort to minimize total dredging and disposal costs and identity
environmentally sensitive and beneficial management practices. Analysis of potential impacts on endangered species,
fisheries, birds, marine mammals, water quality, historic properties, etc., resulting from the various alternatives
will be included in the EIS.

SCOPING PROCESS: Federal, State and local officials; conservation groups, and interested businesses, groups,
and individuals are invited to comment on the proposed project. Comments received as a result of this notice will be
used to assist in identifying potential impacts to the quality of the environment.




AVAILABILITY: 

The Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be made available to the public in October 1994.

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed 1995/1996
Southeast Expansion Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues 


February 2, 1994.


The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the 1995/1996
Southeast Expansion Project.
 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project.





Summary of the Proposed Project


TGPL wants Commission authorization to construct, operate, and modify the following facilities, on a phased basis.
TGPL would use the facilities to transport up to 165,000 Mcfd of natural gas (115,000 Mcfd in 1995 [Phase I] and 50,000
Mcfd in 1996 [Phase II]) from the interconnection of TGPL's main line and its Mobile Bay Lateral near Butler in Choctaw
County, Alabama, to certain points of delivery upstream of TGPL's Compressor Station No. 165 near Chatham, Virginia:


Phase I Facilities (1995)


 12,600-horsepower (HP) compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 90 in Marengo County, Alabama.
 Two 7,000-HP electric drive units to replace two existing 5,620-HP steam turbines on Units 1 and 2 at Compressor
Station No. 100 in Chilton County, Alabama.
 15.13 miles of 42-inch-diameter loop on Main Line E in Chilton and Autauga Counties, Alabama.

 Modifications to existing compressor equipment at Compressor Station No. 110 in Randolph County, Alabama.
 12,000-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 120 in Henry County, Georgia.
 12,600-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 150 in Iredell County, North Carolina.


Phase II Facilities (1996)


 6,500-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 100 in Chilton County, Alabama.
 12,000-HP compressor addition at Compressor Station No. 120 in Henry County, Georgia.





The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1.






Land Requirements for Construction


The proposed loop would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. TGPL intends to use a 75-foot-wide
construction right-of-way. About 15 feet of the planned 75-foot width would use existing right-of-way. Consequently,
about 60 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction, about 35 feet of the construction
right-of-way would be allowed to revert to its former land use. In agricultural areas, a 100-foot-wide construction
right-of-way is planned in order to segregate topsoil.
Also, additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at road and stream
crossings.


The EA Process


The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping.''
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.
The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings:
 Geology and soils.
 Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands.
 Vegetation and wildlife.
 Endangered and threatened species.
 Land use.
 Cultural resources.
 Air quality and noise.
 Hazardous waste.
We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.
Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project.


Currently Identified Environmental Issues


We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by TGPL. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list
of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are:
 The loop would cross within 50 feet of 5 residences and a church, and would cross 2 orchards.
 The pipeline would cross 9 perennial streams, 2 ponds, and 50 wetlands.

 The compressor stations are near residences.

 The project may potentially impact federally listed threatened or endangered species.

 The pipeline may cross or be near cultural resource/archeological sites.



Public Participation



You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns abut the project. You should
focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., NE. Washington, DC 20426;

 Reference Docket No. CP94-109-000;

 Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Philip Veres, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol St., NE. room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before March 3, 1994.




If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Veres at the above address.



Becoming an Intervenor



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered.

Additional information about the proposed project is available for Mr. Philip Veres, EA Project Manager, at (202)
208-1073.

<DOCTITLE>Koch Gateway Pipeline Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


February 2, 1994.


Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway) tendered for filing proposed changes
to its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1.
Koch Gateway states that this filing proposes changes to the rates for Koch Gateway's existing transportation services.
This filing is being made in accordance with Section V(B) of the Joint Stipulation and Agreement entered into between
the parties in Docket No. RP92-235 (62 FERC 61,290 (1993). The tariff is being revised to make those changes which
are necessary to conform this tariff to meet the operational needs of both the customers and Koch Gateway.
Koch Gateway proposes an effective date of March 1, 1994, for the applicable tariff sheets, anticipating that the
Commission will exercise its authority under Section 4(e) of the NGA to suspend the effectiveness of the sheets for
the full five month statutory period so the applicable sheets are allowed to be made effective August 1, 1994.
Koch Gateway states that the rates reflected on the proposed tariff sheets are based on a cost of service of $195.7 million.
This reflects the annual operating costs which Koch Gateway expects to incur utilizing a base period covering the
twelve months ended September 30, 1993, adjusted for known and measurable changes anticipated to occur during the
nine-month period ending June 30, 1994.
Koch Gateway's is proposing an overall rate of return of 12.55 percent based on a capital structure consisting of 31.47
percent debt and 68.53 percent equity and a claimed return on equity of 13.05 percent. The overall cost of service represents
a $8.5 million increase in the cost of service which formed the basis of the rates approved by the Commission in Docket
No. RS92-26.
In this filing, Koch Gateway proposes to use the same cost allocation methodology and rate design which the Commission
approved in Docket No. RS92-26. This methodology includes the classification of fixed costs under the principles
of Straight Fixed Variable (``SFV'') rate design methodology, the utilization of seasonal maximum daily quantities
(``MDQ's'') for the No Notice Service (``NNS''), allocation of costs to the contract storage services, retainage
of the six 100 mile rate types and designing ITS rates on a 125% load factor basis.
Koch Gateway is also proposing several changes to its tariff as a result of experience gained the first few months of
operations under Order No. 636.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214
and 385.211. All such petitions or protests must be filed on or before February 9, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on
file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

EPA is entering into this agreement under the authority of sections 122(g) and 107 of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes
settlements with 

de minimis

 parties to allow them to resolve their liabilities at Superfund sites without incurring substantial transaction
costs. Under this authority, the agreement proposes to settle with these parties for the reimbursement of USEPA's
remaining response costs at the E.H. Schilling Site. These two parties are responsible for much less than one percent
of the total volume of waste sent to the site between 1969 and 1980. The proposed settlement reflects, and was agreed
to based on, conditions as known to the parties as of September 1, 1993. Settling Parties will receive a complete release
from further civil or administrative liabilities at the Site. 
The Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relating to this agreement for thirty days from
the date of publication of this notice. 
A copy of the proposed administrative settlement agreement or additional background information relating to the
settlement is available for review and may be obtained in person or by mail from Monica Smyth, Office of Regional Counsel,
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region V, 77 W. Jackson, Mail Code CS-3T, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information

to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.



OMB Number: 

3060-0466.



Title: 

Section 74.1283, Station identification.



Action: 

Extension of currently approved collection.



Respondents: 

Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).



Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement.



Estimated Annual Burden: 

200 responses; .166 hour average burden per response; 33 hours total annual burden.



Needs and Uses: 

Section 74.1283(c)(1) requires an FM translator station whose station identification is made by the primary station
to furnish current information of the translator's call letters and location (name, address and telephone number).
This information is to be kept in the primary station's files. The information is used by the primary station licensee
and/or FCC staff in field investigations to contact the translator licensee in the event of malfunction of the translator.






OMB Number: 

3060-0473.

installation complies in all respects with the technical requirements of this part and the terms of the station authorization.
Section 74.1251(c) requires FM translator licensees to notify the FCC, in writing, of changes in the primary FM station
being retransmitted. The certification of the new installation is used by licensees to provide prospective users
of the modified equipment with necessary information. If no such information exists, any future problems could provide
difficult to solve and could result in electronic frequency interference for long periods of time. The notification
of changes in the primary FM being retransmitted is used by FCC staff to keep records up-to-date and to ensure compliance
with FCC rules and regulations.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of four new animal drug applications (NADA's) held
by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Pharmachem Corp., Sanofi Animal Health, Inc., and Squire Laboratories, Inc. The
sponsors notified the agency in writing that the animal drug products are no longer marketed and requested that approval
of the applications be withdrawn. In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is amending the regulations by removing the entries which reflect approval of the NADA's.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The sponsors of the NADA's listed in the table in this document have informed FDA that these animal drug products are
no longer marketed or distributed and have requested that FDA withdraw approval of the applications. 




Therefore, under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center
for Veterinary Medicine (21 CFR 5.84), and in accordance with  514.115 

Withdrawal of approval of applications

 (21 CFR 514.115), notice is given that approval of NADA's 10-783, 11-871, 132-137, and 138-455
and all supplements and amendments thereto is hereby withdrawn, effective February 18, 1994.
In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is removing the text of and reserving 21 CFR 520.1962(b) and amending 21 CFR 524.1580d(b) to reflect the withdrawal
of approval of NADA's 10-783 and 138-455, respectively. It is unnecessary to amend the regulations to
reflect withdrawal of approval of the other two NADA's because NADA 11-871 was never codified and the sponsor
of NADA 132-137 (Sanofi) has been previously removed from the regulation.

<DOCTITLE>Withdrawal of Prospective Grant of Exclusive License: Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Vectors for Gene Therapy</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is no longer contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the
United States to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Number 4,797,368 (SN 06/712,236), entitled ``Adeno-Associated
Virus As Eukaryotic Expression Vector'' to Theragen, Inc., of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Based upon written evidence and
argument received in response to a 

Federal Register

 notice (Vol. 57, No. 169, Monday, August 31, 1992, page 39405), the NIH has established that the grant of the license
would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7 and that U.S. Patent 4,797,368 should
be licensed on a non-exclusive basis for the field of gene therapy. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned
to the United States of America.





The patent describes a novel expression vector based on the parvovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is valuable
for the stable maintenance or expression of DNA sequences or genes in eukaryotic cells. The use of many previously
available virus-based eukaryotic expression vectors has been limited because they do not integrate foreign DNA
into the host genome at high frequency and are not easily rescued from their host. This AAV-based expression vector
is easily rescued from the host and allows the host to express the foreign DNA or genes at high frequency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The MMS prepares EA's and FONSI's for proposals which relate to exploration for and the development/production of
oil and gas resources on the Gulf of Mexico OCS. The EA's examine the potential environmental effects of activities
described in the proposals and present MMS conclusions regarding the significance of those effects. Environmental
Assessments are used as a basis for determining whether or not approval of the proposals constitutes major Federal
actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment in the sense of NEPA section 102(2)(C). A FONSI
is prepared in those instances where the MMS finds that approval will not result in significant effects on the quality
of the human environment. The FONSI briefly presents the basis for that finding and includes a summary or copy of the
EA.




This notice constitutes the public notice of availability of environmental documents required under the NEPA Regulations.

<DOCTITLE>Canadian Pacific Limited_Abandonment_Line Between Skinner and Vanceboro, ME </DOCTITLE>



The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) hereby notifies all interested parties that SEA will prepare
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and conduct scoping meetings in this proceeding. The Canadian Pacific
Limited (CP) filed an application for authority to abandon and discontinue all freight and passenger operations
over 201.2 miles of rail line between Skinner and Vanceboro, in Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Aroostook
and Washington Counties, Maine. Because of the proposed abandonment's potential for significant environmental
impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary. 

The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed abandonment and will be served on all
the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period from the date the
DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the DEIS, SEA will
then issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement that will include SEA's final recommendations to the Commission.


SEA will conduct scoping meetings prior to the preparation of the DEIS. The purpose of the scoping process is to identify
significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues to be addressed in the DEIS. Persons that cannot
attend the scoping meetings, may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the scoping meetings.
The public will be notified of the time and location of the scoping meetings at least 20 days prior to the scheduled date.

Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance



Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 221 (a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to Section
221 (a) of the Act.

The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than February 18, 1994.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than February 18, 1994.

The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,
DC 20210.




Signed at Washington, DC this 18th day of January, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Sundstrand Electrical Power Systems Lima, OH; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated January 6, 1994, Local 

#

724 of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration
of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on December 9, 1993 and was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68668).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:




(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.




The union states that some production of generators, small motors and converters formerly produced at Lima were produced
in Puerto Rico.

Investigation findings show that the Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly''
test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally demonstrated through
a survey of the workers' firm's customers. The Department's survey of Sundstrand Electrical Power Systems major
declining customers shows that none of the respondents reported purchasing imported generators, small motors or
converters during the relevant period.

Further, Puerto Rico is within the U.S. Customs boundary, accordingly, and production in Puerto Rico is considered
domestic production and is not an import.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 25th day of January 1994.

 Public Notice of Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This public notice announces the establishment of the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) and associated public
programs. NCCC's mission is to promote civic pride and responsibility through community service. National Civilian
Community Corps members, in collaboration with community representatives will under take community projects with
agreed upon and measurable results. Participants shall be ethnically, economically, and socially diverse youth
and receive innovative and structured training programs that combine the best of military training techniques,
Civilian Conservation Corps values, and service learning models.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:
Background


The National and Community Service Trust Act (Act), signed by President Clinton on September 21, 1993, amended the
National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12501 et seq.). Under Subtitle E of the Act, NCCC was directed
to accomplish the following:



1. Determine whether residential service programs administered by the Federal Government can significantly increase
the support for national service and community service by the people of the United States.
2. Determine whether such programs can expand the opportunities for young men and women to perform meaningful, direct,
and consequential act of community service in a manner that will enhance their own skills while contributing to their
understanding of civic responsibility in the United States.
3. Determine whether retired members and former members of the Armed Forces of the United States, members and former
members of the Armed Forces discharged or released from active duty in connection with reduced Department of Defense
spending, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or transferred from the Selective Reserve of
the Ready Reserve in connection with reduced DOD spending, and other members of the Armed Forces not on active duty
and not actively participating in a reserve component of the Armed Forces can provide guidance and training under
such programs that contribute meaningfully to the encouragement of national and community service.
4. Determine whether domestic national service programs can serve as a substitute for the traditional option of military
service in the Armed Forces of the United States which, in times of reductions in the size of the Armed Forces, is a diminishing
national service opportunity for young Americans.



Under the provisions of Subtitle E, the NCCC is developing two residential programs, the National Service Program
and the Summer National Service Program. Both programs combine the best of the Civilian Conservation Corps values,
military training techniques, and innovative service learning models. The NCCC strategy includes accomplishment
of the following activities:



1. Implement the residential programs for 1000 young men and women at four regional sites located in the Northeast,
Southeast, Midwest, and West by 4th quarter FY94.
2. Operate a Summer National Service program on a military base in the Northeast region during FY94.
3. Expand enrollment and establish 4 additional camps by 4th quarter FY95.
4. Plan for a yearly capacity of 6000 corps members by FY2001.
5. Obtain corporate funding for half of FY95 program and for each year thereafter.
6. Implement a prototype recruiting and selection process using existing federal agencies.
7. Perform community service activities that help solve unmet needs in the education, environment, human service,
and public safety areas. All community service projects must meet an identifiable public need, provide meaningful
community benefits for service learning and skill development, encourage work to be done in teams of diverse individuals,
and include continued educational and training for corps members in various technical fields.


National Service Program


Young people aged 18-24 are eligible to participate as corps members. Four regional campuses are being established;
one in the Northeast, one in the South, one in the Midwest, and one in the West. Each campus will be located on a military
installation. Corps members will be recruited and will enter into agreement to participate for a period of eleven
months. The campus experience will be divided into two phases. During phase I, corps members will receive approximately
six weeks of initial training. Phase II will include continued personal development, training, education, and the
performance of community service projects. The corps members will be a diverse group reflecting the population of
the United States. Corps members will represent almost all ethnic groups, cultures, genders, and come from both urban
and rural areas.

To the extent practicable, at least 50 percent of the corps members will be economically disadvantaged youths. Corps
members will receive a living allowance, during the eleven month program and will also receive a post-service benefit
upon successful completion.



Summer National Service Program



The Summer National Service program will be a residential program for youth 14-17 years of age. Summer corps
members shall enter into agreement to participate for a period of eight weeks. Participants will receive approximately
two weeks of training followed by six weeks of community service projects. The FY94 summer campus will be located on
a military base in the Northeast and focus on public safety and environmental projects. Summer camp participants
will represent the same diverse group explained under the National Service Program, receive a living allowance and
will also receive a post-service benefit upon successful completion.



NCCC Program Benefits



NCCC programs benefit individuals, communities, and the nation. Programs benefit individuals by providing educational
opportunities, assisting transitioning military personnel, and helping to establish a work ethic in young adults.
Communities benefit through the completion of community projects that would otherwise not be done. Our nation benefits
by improved social and racial relationships, maximized use of existing federal resources, and increased public
awareness of environmental, education, human services, and public safety issues.



Concept Papers



Interested organizations and individuals are encouraged to submit concept papers in support of the above NCCC programs.
Submissions will be reviewed and maintained on file by category to assist the NCCC staff in program development. Submitters
may be contacted during the developmental and implementation phases for further details or possible collaboration
to accomplish program elements.

This notice does not obligate the NCCC to enter into any grants or contracts as a result of this notice.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Philadelphia Electric Co., Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for
the Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1, located at the licensee's site in the Chester and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would grant an exemption from 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a) which requires a
set of three Type A tests (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)) to be performed at approximately
equal intervals during each 10-year service period and specifies that the third test of each set shall be conducted
when the plant is shutdown for the performance of the 10-year plant inservice inspection (ISI). The exemption would
allow a one-time 15-month extension of the 40 +/^ 10-month interval between the Unit 1 second and third Type A test required
by Technical Specifications (TS) Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.a. Hence, this one-time exemption would allow
the third, Unit 1, Type A test to be performed during the sixth Unit 1 refueling outage scheduled to begin in January
1996, approximately 65 months after the last Unit 1 test, thereby coinciding with the 10-year plant ISI refueling
outage.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated November 30, 1993.



Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption from Appendix J is required in order to allow the third Type A test to be performed during the
sixth Unit 1 refueling outage scheduled to begin in January 1996, thereby coinciding with the 10-year ISI refueling
outage, instead of requiring the performance of a Type A test during both the fifth and sixth Unit 1 refueling outages.
This one-time extension of the Type A test interval would also result in the third Type A test being performed 20 months
after the end of the Unit 1 first 10-year service period specified in 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, ``Primary Reactor Containment
Leakage Testing for Water-Cooled Reactors'' (i.e., August, 1994). In this way the third Type A test would be performed
during the sixth Unit 1 refueling outage which would align the start of the second 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, 10-year
service period with the start of the second 10-year ISI period.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action





The Commission has completed the evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that this action would not significantly
increase the probability or amount of expected primary containment leakage; hence, the containment integrity would
be maintained. The current requirement in Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J in 10 CFR part 50 to perform the three Type
A tests would continue to be met, with the exception of the time interval between the second and the third Type A tests
would be extended from 40 +/^ 10 months to 65 months. The third Type A test would be performed approximately 65 months
after the second Type A test and approximately 20 months after the end of the first 10 year service period. Based on the
information presented in the licensee's application, the proposed extended test interval would not result in a non-detectable
leakage rate in excess of the value established by 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, or in any changes to the containment structure
or plant systems. Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased, nor would the post-accident
radiological releases be greater than previously determined. Neither would the proposed exemption otherwise affect
radiological plant effluents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in
no significant radiological environmental impact.


With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.




Alternatives to the Proposed Action




Since the Commission concluded that there are no measurable environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.


The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.




Alternative Use of Resources



This proposed action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental
Statements for the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, dated April 1984.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the State of Pennsylvania regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.

Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.


For further details with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated November 30, 1993, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street,
Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464.

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the
Haddam Neck Plant located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirement 4.4.10, ``Structural Integrity,'' by replacing
the current reactor coolant pump flywheel inspection frequency and examination methods with an alternate program.


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By March 10, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut
06457. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number; date petition was mailed;
plant name; and publication date and page number of the 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry & Howard Counselors at Law City Place, Hartford,
Connecticut 06103-3499, attorney for the licensee.

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the
Haddam Neck Plant located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would modify the technical specifications to increase the maximum nominal fuel enrichment
allowed to be stored in both the new fuel storage racks and the spent fuel pool to a nominal 5.0 weight-percent (w/o)
U-235. To support this proposed amendment Technical Specification Section 5.6, ``Fuel Storage,'' subsections
5.6.1.1.b, 5.6.1.2.a, and 5.6.1.2.b will be revised and Specifications 1.38, 1.39, 3.9.13, and 3.9.14 will be added.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By March 10, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut
06457. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.


As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number; date petition was mailed;
plant name; and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry & Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford,
Connecticut 06103-3499, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards consideration in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Extension of Its Pilot After-Hours Trading Facility



February 1, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and
II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended
the filing to request that the pilot program for its After-Hours Trading facility be extended for a three-month period,
until April 30, 1994, while the Commission considers the Exchange's request for permanent approval of the pilot program.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to extend its pilot After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility through April 30, 1994. The current
pilot program was scheduled to expire on January 31, 1994.

The Exchange requests accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. The Exchange believes that accelerated
effectiveness is appropriate since it would permit the Exchange's existing AHT facility to continue operating while
the Commission considers permanent approval of the facility. The proposal to extend the AHT pilot, therefore, does
not raise any new questions for the commission's consideration.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



In August 1991, the Commission partially approved the Exchange's AHT facility on a temporary basis.
 This facility permits the execution of coupled and single-sided closing price orders after the close of the 9:30 a.m.
to 4 p.m. trading session. Commencing at 4:15 p.m., single-sided round lot orders for equity securities can be entered
through the Exchange's PER system or left with the specialist or the specialist's authorized representative for
matching and execution at 5 p.m. at the Exchange's last closing regular way price. Coupled buy and sell round lot, odd
lot and partial round lot orders also can be entered through the PER system, or left with the specialist for execution
at 5 p.m. against each other at the Exchange's last regular way price. Members are permitted to designate good `til
cancelled (``GTC'') limit orders entered during the regular trading session as eligible for execution in the AHT
session. Such orders are marked ``GTX'' and migrate to the AHT facility for possible execution.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission stated in its order approving the AHT facility that it would review the operation of the facility during
the temporary approval period. In this regard, the Commission asked the Exchange to assemble data on the operation
of the facility which the Exchange submitted under separate cover. It is the Exchange's opinion that the system has
functioned well during the temporary approval period and that the operation of the system has not had any adverse effects
upon the development of the national market system. The Exchange, therefore, seeks a three month extension for its
AHT facility.






2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just
and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect of the proposed rule change.

III. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-93-15
and should be submitted by March 1, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



For the reasons set forth below, the Commission finds that approval of the Exchange's proposed rule change, for a temporary
period ending on April 30, 1994, is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to
a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections 6 and 11A of the Act.
 The Commission believes that the Amex proposal is reasonably designed to promote just and equitable principles of
trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, further investor
protection and the public interest in fair and orderly markets on national securities exchanges, as well as facilitate
the linking of qualified markets through appropriate communications systems and execution of investors' orders
in the best market.





In the Commission's release approving the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') Off-Hours Trading (``OHT'') facility,
the Commission noted the benefits that would accrue to investors through the development of an after-hours trading
session.
 By allowing Amex members to enter single-sided and coupled orders into an after-hours facility, as well as permitting
the migration of certain limit orders (GTX orders) from the regular 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session for possible
execution in the AHT facility, the Amex is providing a mechanism for maintaining its own individual marketplace on
a competitive level with the NYSE and the regional exchanges.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change which enables members to enter both proprietary
and agency orders in Exchange-traded equity securities, including stocks, rights, warrants, primes and scores,
ADRs, and non-option equity derivative products, for execution at the Exchange's last closing regular way price
should be extended until April 30, 1994.






In its orders approving and extending the Amex AHT pilot program, the Commission requested that the Amex provide the
Commission with specific data and a report regarding the operation of the Amex's AHT pilot.





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00087 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Amex has reported to the Commission, on a monthly basis, the number of trade and share volume of orders executed
after the close pursuant to the pilot procedures. In addition, on May 21, 1993, and September 30, 1993, the Exchange
filed with the Commission reports which address the Exchange's experience with the AHT pilot through September 1,
1993.
 The Commission expects the Exchange to submit to the Commission by March 15, 1994, an updated report concerning pilot
activity through February 28, 1994.







The Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program in order to provide the Amex and Commission
with additional time to review the pilot program. The pilot extension also will provide the Commission with an opportunity
to study the reports supplied by the Amex. During the pilot extension, the Commission expects that the Amex will continue
to monitor the operation of the AHT pilot program. In addition, the Commission continues to request that the Exchange
keep the Commission apprised of any technical problems or patterns of manipulation or trading abuses which may arise
regarding the operation of the new rule.


The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the proposal is appropriate in order to allow the Amex procedures
to remain in place on an uninterrupted basis. This will permit the Amex to continue to compete with the NYSE's OHT facility,
which in turn should benefit investors and promote competition among markets.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that a portion of the proposed rule change (Amex-93-15), as discussed above, is hereby approved on a pilot
basis through April 30, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., et al.; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Changes Relating to an Extension of Pilot Program Which Provides Price Protection of Limit
Orders Executable After the Close of Regular Trading Hours</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.
(``PSE''), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'') (collectively, the ``Regional Exchanges'') have
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes to extend the effectiveness
of their respective pilot programs relating to price protection of limit orders.
 The Exchanges have requested accelerated approval of their respective proposals. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Regional Exchanges propose to extend their respective pilot programs relating to price protection of limit orders
until April 30, 1994. The rule changes provide primary market protection to certain limit orders trading at the limit
price in a primary market's after-hours trading session.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In their filings with the Commission, the self-regulatory organizations included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments they received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organizations
have prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Regional Exchanges are requesting a three month extension of their respective pilot programs relating to price
protection of limit orders based on after-hours prints in a primary market. The pilot programs require Exchange specialists
to provide primary market protection for those limit orders entered during an Exchange's primary trading session
which are designated as executable after the close of the regular Exchange auction market trading session, known
as ``GTX'' orders (``good until cancelled, executable in the afternoon session'').

The Regional Exchanges have provided the Commission with updated reports describing their experience with the new
rules.
 The Commission will be reviewing those reports and new reports during the three-month extension of the pilots.

2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule changes are consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 11A of the Act in that they are designed to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open national market system, and, in general,
further investor protection and the public interest in fair and orderly markets on national securities exchanges.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The exchanges believe that no burdens will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule changes.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No comments were received on the proposed rule changes.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal offices of the CHX, BSE, PSE and Phlx. All submissions should refer to File
Nos. SR-CHX-93-23, SR-BSE-93-18, SR-PSE-1 and SR-Phlx-94-7,
and should be submitted by March 1, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



The Commission finds that the Regional Exchanges' proposals to extend their respective pilot programs, until April
10, 1994, to provide price protection of limit orders executable after the close of regular trading hours is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.
Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposals are reasonably designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general,
further investor protection and the public interest in fair and orderly markets on national securities exchanges.
For these reasons, as discussed in more detail below and in the original approval orders, the Commission finds that
approval of the proposed rule changes, for a temporary period ending on April 30, 1994, is consistent with the Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6 of the Act.






In the Commission's release approving the NYSE's OHT facility, the Commission noted the benefits that would accrue
to investors through the development of an after-hours trading session.
 Although the Regional Exchanges' proposals did not establish after-hours sessions identical to that of the NYSE,
the Commission believes that they provide a reasonable competitive response. By allowing GTX orders that would be
executed on the NYSE to receive a similar fill on the Exchanges, the proposal is providing a mechanism for maintaining
its own individual marketplace on a competitive level with the primary market.

<PARENT> FR940208-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the original approval and extension orders, the Commission requested reports on the pilot programs, as well as
weekly data.
 The Commission expects the Regional Exchanges to submit to the Commission by March 15, 1994, updated reports concerning
pilot activity through February 28, 1994.






The Commission continues to expect the Regional Exchanges, through use of their surveillance procedures, to monitor
for, and report to the Commission, any patterns of manipulation or trading abuses or unusual trading activity resulting
from these pilot programs. In addition, the Commission continues to request that the Exchanges keep the Commission
apprised of any technical problems which may arise regarding the operation of the pilot programs, such as difficulties
in order execution or order cancellation.
The Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot programs until April 30, 1994, in order to provide
the Commission with an opportunity to continue to review the reports submitted by the Exchanges. The Commission also
will be considering the various requests for permanent approval of these programs during the three-month extensions.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the proposal is appropriate in order to allow the Exchanges'
procedures to remain in place on an uninterrupted basis. This will permit the Exchanges to continue to compete with
Crossing Session I of the NYSE's OHT facility, which in turn should benefit investors and promote competition among
markets.
It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the CHX, BSE, PSE, and Phlx proposed rule changes (CHX-93-23, BSE-93-18, PSE-94-1,
and Phlx-94-7) are hereby approved on a pilot basis until April 30, 1994.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the
Addition of Rules 72(b) and 410A to the ``List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to
Rule 476A'' and Amending Minor Rule Violation Enforcement and Reporting Plan</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.


Pursuant to Sections 19 (b)(1) and (d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rules 19b-4 and 19d-1(c)(2) thereunder
 notice is hereby given that on May 27, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and
III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization (``SRO''). On June 9, 1993, the NYSE
submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 On January 3, 1994, the Commission received from the NYSE Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


This proposal would revise the Rule 476A Violations List for imposition of fines for minor violations of rules and/or
policies by adding to the list violations of Exchange Rule 410A and the provision in Rule 72(b) which prohibits proprietary
participation in a cross transaction.
 The Exchange proposes to adopt the following amendment:






List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to Rule 476A


 Rule 72(b) requirements for ``clean'' agency crosses which cannot be broken up at the cross price





 Rule 410A requirements for automated submission of trading data

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




(a) Purpose



Rule 476A
 provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, or any member, member organization, allied member,
approved person, or registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a minor violation
of certain specified Exchange rules.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00094 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The purpose of Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is appropriate
but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding would be
more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation.
 Rule 476A provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules while preserving the
due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. The list of rules which are eligible
for 476A procedures specifies those rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes
a schedule of fines.





In SR-NYSE-84-27, which initially set forth the provisions and procedures of Rule 476A, the Exchange
indicated it would amend the list of rules from time to time, as it considered appropriate, in order to phase-in the
implementation of Rule 476A as experience with it was gained.






The Exchange is presently seeking approval to add the following Exchange Rules to the List of Rules subject to possible
imposition of fines under Rule 476A procedures:




 Rule 72(b) which establishes conditions under which ``clean'' agency crosses of 25,000 shares or more cannot
be broken at the cross price;






 Rule 410A which requires members and member organizations to submit certain information concerning transactions
in an automated format as requested by the Exchange;






The purpose for the proposed change to Rule 476A is to facilitate the Exchange's ability to induce compliance with
all aspects of the above-named Rules.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange believes failure to comply with the requirements of these Rules should be addressed with an appropriate
sanction and seeks Commission approval to add violations of these requirements to the Rule 476A List. 



(b) Statutory Basis 



The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b) (6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure
whereby member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those instances when a rule violation is minor
in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter is appropriate. The proposed rule change
provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(7) and
6(d)(1) of the Act. 



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others 



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 




(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communication relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-93-27
and should be submitted by March 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Off-Hours Trading Facility and Matched MOC Order Procedures</DOCTITLE>


February 1, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on December 23, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Exchange has requested
accelerated approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Commission's order approving the Exchange's Off-Hours Trading (``OHT'') facility contained a two-year ``sunset''
provision.
 The Commission later extended the ``sunset'' date until January 31, 1994.
 The proposed rule change seeks to extend (i) that ``sunset,'' and (ii) the concurrent end of the pilot program for procedures
regulating matched market-on-close (``MOC'') orders, to April 30, 1994.







The Exchange requests accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. Accelerated approval would enable the Exchange
to continue Crossing Session I and Crossing Session II, and the matched MOC pilot program, as described below, on an
uninterrupted basis.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose



(a)

 OHT facility.

 By order dated May 24, 1991,
 the Commission approved for a two-year temporary period the OHT facility by which the Exchange offers its two off-hours
trading sessions. ``Crossing Session I'' permits the execution of single-stock, single-sided closing-price orders
and crosses of single-stock, closing-price buy and sell orders. ``Crossing Session II'' allows the execution of
crosses of multiple-stock (portfolios of 15 or more securities) aggregate price buy and sell orders.





The Exchange began offering the two sessions on June 13, 1991. On May 25, 1993, the Commission approved an extension
of the Pilot until January 31, 1994 (``Extension Order'').
 The proposed rule change seeks to extend approval of the pilot until April 30, 1994. The Exchange has submitted to the
Commission contemporaneously with this proposed rule change a second proposed rule pursuant to which the Exchange
has requested permanent approval of both Crossing Session I and Crossing Session II (``Permanent Approval Filing'').
 The Exchange therefore requests this extension until April 30, 1994, to provide for the continuity of the crossing
sessions, pending Commission action on the Permanent Approval Filing.






(b)

 Matched MOC Orders.

 In File No SR-NYSE-91-35, the Exchange requested that procedures for using matched MOC orders and
the exemption from SEC Rule 10a-1 (relating to short sales of securities)
 for such orders (which had originally been filed as part of the pilot extending expiration Friday pricing procedures
for MOC orders for every trading day) run concurrently with the temporary period for the Exchange's OHT facility.
In its order approving this filling, the Commission stated that ``it is appropriate to allow the Exchange additional
time to compare and contrast the matched MOC procedures with Crossing Session II.''
 On May 25, 1993, the Crossing Session II approved an Exchange request to extend the pilot program for matched MOC procedures
until January 31, 1994.
 







The Exchange has reviewed program trading activity by its member firms through December 17, 1993, but has not found
any instances of firms entering matched MOC orders up to that point. As with Crossing Session I and II, the Exchange
has included in the Permanent Approval Filing a request for permanent approval of the matched MOC order procedures.
 The Exchange requests an extension until April 30, 1994, so as to provide for the continuity of those procedures, pending
Commission action on the Permanent Approval Filing.





2. Statutory Basis



The basis under the Act for the Exchange's OHT facility and the matched MOC order procedures, and for this extension
of approval of the facility and those procedures, is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have rules
that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00098 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-2-00072 </PARENT>

The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on the proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-93-51
and should be submitted by March 1, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



For the reasons discussed below, the Commission finds that the NYSE's proposal to extend, through April 30, 1994,
the pilot program providing for the Exchange's OHT facility and the pilot program for procedures regulating matched
MOC orders is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a
national securities exchange,
 and in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b)(5).
 The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to extend the OHT facility pilot, comprised of Crossing Sessions
I and II, is reasonably designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is also approving a three-month extension for matched MOC
orders.






(1) OHT Procedures for Crossing Sessions I and II

<PARENT> FR940208-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the Commission's order approving the NYSE's OHT facility, the Commission noted the benefits that would accrue
to investors through the development of an after-hours trading session.
 The Commission stated its belief that Crossing Session I would provide investors whose orders were not executed during
the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. session with another opportunity to have their orders executed at the NYSE closing price. Crossing
Session I also would provide investors the flexibility to decide whether they want a particular order to participate
in this Session. With respect to good til cancelled (``GTC'') orders entered for execution during the 9:30 a.m. to
4 p.m. trading session, a customer would have the option of deciding whether to designate that order as a GTX (good til
cancelled, executable through crossing session) order, thus allowing the order to migrate to Crossing Session I
for possible execution. In addition, a customer would have the option of cancelling any order entered into Crossing
Session I at any time prior to its execution at 5 p.m. These benefits would accrue to both individual and institutional
investors. Moreover, the Commission stated its belief that Crossing Session I may help recapture overseas order
flow by enabling firms to facilitate a number of portfolio trading strategies involving small programs of stocks
to achieve executions at the NYSE closing price.





Similarly, the Commission stated its belief that Crossing Session II would benefit the investing public by offering
members the opportunity to enter aggregate-price crossing portfolio orders with their customers after-hours to
be executed against each other. The Commission recognized that Crossing Session II could help to recapture overseas
trades of U.S. stocks by providing a mechanism by which portfolio trades arranged off the floor can be effected in an
exchange trading system. While the Commission recognizes that Crossing Session II does not provide an auction market
for portfolio trades, the reality of the marketplace is that these portfolio trades currently are being effected
off-exchange and, frequently, overseas. Bringing institutional trades that currently are being exported overseas
for execution within the purview of U.S. regulatory bodies should benefit the marketplace overall, as well as help
to protect the investing public.

Although the Commission discussed these prospective benefits of the OHT program in its order approving the pilot
program procedures, the Commission also voiced concern regarding certain issues concerning the NYSE OHT facility,
particularly with regard to Crossing Session II and certain National Market System (``NMS'') concerns. In order
to address these concerns, the Commission approved the OHT facility on a pilot basis, and requested that the Exchange
submit a report concerning various aspects of the pilot, including information regarding the ability of customers
to cancel orders entered into the OHT facility.

<PARENT> FR940208-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the order extending the pilot program, the Commission requested that the Exchange submit another report which
discusses all those elements described above. The Exchange submitted a report to the Commission on September 30,
1993, which contained an analysis of trading activity in the OHT facility since its inception.
 The Commission expects the Exchange to submit to the Commission by March 15, 1994, an updated report concerning pilot
activity through February 28, 1994.
 In addition, the Exchange continues to submit trade and share volume of OHT activity to the Commission on an on-going,
weekly basis.






(2) Matched MOC Orders



In its original order approving the matched MOC pilot program, and in the subsequent orders which have extended the
pilot program through May 24, 1993 and January 31, 1994, the Commission voiced concern that, under the pilot procedures,
matched MOC orders would be executed without the opportunity for order exposure or interaction with the trading crowd.
Because these procedures were in contravention of traditional auction market procedures, the Commission was concerned
that customer orders on the list order book or in the trading crowd could be by-passed. The Commission, however, initially
approved these procedures for a pilot period, because these procedures could aid in attracting order flow being executed
overseas back to the NYSE which has the advantage of Commission and Exchange oversight pursuant to the Act, trade reporting,
and consolidated surveillance.

The Commission has extended the pilot program primarily to give the Exchange the opportunity to contrast the use of
matched MOC orders with certain program trading transactions effected in the Exchange's Crossing Session II. In
the order extending the matched MOC pilot program through May 24, 1993, the Commission stated that it was extending
the pilot program, not because its original concerns regarding the possible displacement of customer orders had
been alleviated, but because the Commission found it reasonable to extend the pilot period in light of the NYSE's desire
to contrast its use with that of the recently instituted after-hours trading system.

<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00101 </DOCNO>

The stock exchanges continually are developing new trading procedures and products in an attempt to facilitate the
trading of portfolios of securities. The matched MOC order pilot procedures and the NYSE's OHT facility are but two
examples of such developments. Thus, due to the NYSE's ongoing attempt to understand how trades of member firms and
their customers could be most efficiently facilitated, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to allow the
Exchange additional time to compare and contrast the matched MOC procedures with Crossing Session II.

The Commission finds it reasonable to extend the pilot program for matched MOC orders and the exemption from SEC Rule
10a-1 in order to give the Commission and Exchange the necessary time to evaluate the matched MOC order procedures.
In addition, the Commission continues to emphasize that, during the course of the pilot program, the Exchange is under
a continued obligation to inform the Commission of its members' use, if any, of the matched MOC procedures and to assess
the impact of matched MOC orders on overall market quality and on any possible displacement of orders on the specialist's
book or in the trading crowd.


The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the proposal is appropriate in order to allow the OHT and MOC
procedures to remain in place on an uninterrupted basis, which in turn should benefit investors and promote competition
among markets.

It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-93-51) is hereby approved on a pilot basis through April
30, 1994.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change
by Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Capital Requirement for the Designated Primary Market Maker in the
Chicago Stock Basket</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on January 22, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The CHX has requested accelerated
approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to Rule 3 of Article XXXVI that describes the capital
requirement for the Designated Primary Market Maker (``DPM'') of the Chicago Stock Basket (``CXM'').

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to reduce the capital requirement of the DPM for the CXM, and clarify that
the excess capital
 required to be maintained by the DPM is not excess 

net 

capital
 and therefore does not include haircuts. Specifically, the proposed rule change would reduce the DPM's excess capital
requirement to $150,000 from $250,000. Because of the low trading volume in the CXM, the Exchange believes that the
current capital requirement is too burdensome and not commensurate with the risk involved.





2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designated to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No comments were solicited or received.


III. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-94-01
and should be submitted by March 1, 1994.


IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.




In its order approving the CXM,
 the Commission found that, in comparison to other methods of portfolio trading, basket products, such as the CXM,
are an efficient means to make investment decisions based on the direction of standardized measures of stock market
performance, and may enhance the market's ability to absorb program trading. As part of its review, the Commission
evaluated, among other things, the trading structure for market basket contracts and, in particular, the responsibilities
assigned to the DPM
 and Exchange oversight of the DPM's performance. The Commission concluded that the CHX's financial standards, including
the requirement that the DPM set aside an extra cushion of capital above that otherwise required for a specialist under
relevant Commission and Exchange rules,
 should help to ensure that the DPM has sufficient resources to perform his or her market making obligations effectively.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00104 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940208-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To the extent that trading volume in the CXM may be lower than originally was forseen, the Exchange argues that the current
capital requirements is too burdensome for the DPM and should be lowered to a level that is more commensurate with the
DPM's actual exposure to risk. After careful review of the proposed rule change, the Commission continues to believe
that the DPM should have adequate capital to conduct his or her market making activities. Accordingly, in these particular
circumstances, the Commission believes that it is not inconsistent with the Act for the CHX to reduce the DPM's capital
requirement that is set forth in the Exchange rules governing basket trading.

In reaching the above conclusion, however, the Commission placed great weight on the CHX's representations regarding
the depth and liquidity of the prevailing market for the CXM. The Commission expects and the Exchange has agreed that,
if there is a significant increase in basket trading volume, then the CHX will reconsider the adequacy of its reduced
capital requirement and, if appropriate, submit another proposed rule change to the Commission.






The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that accelerated approval of this proposal should allow a regulatory burden to be reduced
immediately, thereby facilitating the efficient allocation of market making capital.


 




It Is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CHX-94-01) is hereby approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation and The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Notice
of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Acceptance of Mutual Funds as Margin Deposits</DOCTITLE>


January 31, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on February 26, 1993, and on November 9, 1993, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'')
and The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC''), respectively, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared
primarily by OCC and ICC. On November 11, 1993, and on December 29, 1993, OCC filed amendments to the proposed rule changes.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes



The proposed rule changes will expand the acceptable forms of margin collateral which clearing members may deposit
with OCC and ICC to include mutual fund shares that are denominated in either U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency designated
by OCC and ICC.



II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



In its filing with the Commission, OCC and ICC included statements concerning the purposes of and basis for the proposed
rule changes. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC and ICC have
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



The purpose of this rule change is to expand the acceptable forms of margin collateral to include shares of mutual funds
that are denominated in either U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency designated by OCC and ICC. In order to be eligible
as a form of margin collateral mutual fund shares must meet the standards prescribed in proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2)
and ICC Rule 502(a)(5). Pursuant to these proposed rules, OCC and ICC will accept redeemable mutual fund shares that
are issued by an open-end management investment company that is registered with the Commission under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').
 Approval of each mutual fund as an eligible form of margin deposit will be made on a case-by-case basis by each of OCC's
and ICC's board of directors, and such approval may be refused or revoked at any time for any reason. This reservation
reflects OCC's and ICC's right to determine whether a particular fund is acceptable to OCC or ICC and to ensure that
OCC and ICC may act expeditiously in the event a change in the financial or operational condition of a particular fund
puts OCC or ICC at risk.





A fund whose shares are denominated in U.S. dollars will be required to maintain its portfolio investments in accordance
with the provisions of proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2)(A)(1) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5)(A)(1), which incorporate the conditions
of paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of Commission Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.
 Paragraph (c) of Commission Rule 2a-7 generally sets forth the formulas that may be used in calculating the current
price per share for purposes of distribution and redemption. Paragraph (c)(1) specifies that a fund's board of directors
must determine that it is in the best interest of the fund to maintain a stable net asset value and paragraph (c)(2) requires
the fund to limit the maturity of its portfolio investments to the terms set forth therein. Paragraph (c)(3) requires
that a fund's portfolio investments be limited to instruments that present minimal credit risks and, with certain
exceptions enumerated in paragraph (c)(3), be ``eligible securities''
 at the time of their acquisition. Paragraph (c)(4) limits to 5% the percentage of the fund's total assets that may be
invested in the securities of a single issuer (except for U.S. government securities).

By incorporating the foregoing standards in proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5), OCC and ICC intend
for the present time to limit their acceptance of U.S. dollar-denominated mutual fund shares to those which qualify
as money market funds under Rule 2a-7. OCC and ICC believe that the foregoing standards are well-founded in that
they are based on the Commission's rule governing money market funds and thereby create reasonable and prudent safeguards
for OCC's and ICC's protection. 

A fund whose shares are denominated in a designated foreign currency will be required to maintain its portfolio investments
in accordance with proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2)(A)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5)(A)(2), which have been adapted from
Commission Rule 2a-7.
 Consistent with the valuation method imposed on U.S. dollar-denominated funds, a non-U.S. dollar-denominated
fund will be required to maintain a stable net asset value. The average portfolio maturity of such fund will be no more
than thirty days. Accordingly, the fund's portfolio should be invested in frequently maturing assets for the purposes
of, among other things, funding redemptions. 





In addition, the portfolio investments of a non-U.S. dollar-denominated fund will be limited to the following assets:
(1) Short-term government securities that are denominated in the designated foreign currency, provided that such
government securities are issued or guaranteed by a sovereign government whose standard unit of official medium
of exchange is the designated foreign currency; (2) debt securities of supranational organizations;
 (3) fully-collateralized repurchase agreements;
 or (4) instruments in the form of bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit, or demand or other deposits that
are denominated in the designated foreign currency.
 Any issuer of such instruments must have shareholders' equity in excess of $200,000,000.

<TEXT>
 

OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5) also specify a diversification requirement for a designated foreign currency
fund's portfolio investments. Specifically, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, no more than 25% of a fund's
total portfolio investments may be held in the securities of a single issuer and with respect to 50% of the fund's total
portfolio investments, no more than 5% of such assets may be invested in the securities of a single issuer.
 OCC and ICC believe that these standards create reasonable and prudent safeguards as they have been adapted from the
Commission's rule applicable to money market funds.





The current market value of deposited shares of each fund will be calculated by multiplying the number of deposited
shares by the fund's last reported net asset valuation. That amount, less any ``haircut'' and, in the case of mutual
funds denominated in a designated foreign currency, exchange rates that OCC or ICC apply for their protection, will
represent the amount of margin credit given to a clearing member with respect to such shares.

OCC Rule 604(b)(2)(B) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5)(B) contain other provisions that also are intended for OCC's and ICC's
protection. OCC and ICC will be permitted to establish a limitation on the amount of the margin requirement in an account
of a clearing member which may be met by depositing shares of any one fund. The chairman or president (or their designee)
also will be authorized to limit the amount of margin credit given to each clearing member that has deposited shares
of a particular fund to an account of OCC or ICC.
 OCC and ICC further will be authorized to redeem or otherwise order the disposition of deposited shares at any time
without prior notice to the clearing member regardless of whether or not the clearing member has been suspended.





OCC and ICC contemplate that the shares of mutual funds will be uncertificated securities and that shares acquired
by a clearing member will be deposited with OCC or ICC via book-entry. The shares will be registered in OCC's or ICC's
name to secure the obligations of the depositing clearing member to OCC or ICC. Consistent with other OCC and ICC rules,
all gain or dividends accrued on such shares (prior to their redemption or disposition) will belong to the depositing
clearing member.

In considering whether to accept mutual fund shares as a qualified form of margin collateral, OCC and ICC became aware
of the Global Settlement Fund (``GSF''). GSF is an open-end investment company registered with the Commission. Based
upon information presented by GSF concerning the portfolios that it offers, OCC's and ICC's boards have approved
the acceptance of GSF shares. A complete description of GSF policies and operations is contained in its registration
statement and amended prospectus, which are incorporated by reference herein.
 The following paragraphs summarize the portions of GSF's prospectus on which OCC and ICC rely in accepting GSF shares.





GSF currently is designed to offer three individual portfolios, each of which is represented by a separate series
of common stock of GSF. The three portfolios are denominated in U.S. dollars (``U.S. dollar portfolio''), British
pound sterling (``pound portfolio''), and Japanese yen (``yen portfolio''). At this time, GSF only offers shares
in the U.S. dollar portfolio.

Each portfolio is authorized to invest in specific instruments. The investments in the U.S. dollar portfolio are
limited to U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of ninety days or less and repurchase agreements covering U.S.
Treasury securities. Such repurchase agreements must be secured by U.S. Treasury securities having no more than
two years remaining to maturity.
 The average portfolio maturity of the U.S. dollar portfolio is fifty days. The pound and yen portfolios will be limited
to investments in the short-term obligations of the British and Japanese governments, respectively, and certain
short-term certificates of deposit, and demand or time deposits of British and Japanese banks, respectively, with
credit ratings in one of the two highest rating categories of two NRSROs. In addition, the pound and yen portfolios
will invest in the short-term debt securities of supranational organizations which have a credit rating in the highest
rating category of two NRSROs. The yen portfolio also will invest in repurchase agreements secured by direct obligations
of the Japanese government which have a remaining term to maturity of no more than two years. The average term to maturity
of securities in the pound and yen portfolios is thirty days. Accordingly, the investment activities of the U.S. dollar,
pound, and yen portfolios meet the applicable standards of proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC rule 502(a)(5).

OCC, TCC, and their clearing members will interface with GSF through what is termed the GlobeSet System. The GlobeSet
System entails use of specialized software on a personal computer along with a modem and encryption device. Additional
security for the GlobeSet System will include the use of identification codes and passwords. Purchase, redemption,
transfer, and other instructions will be transmitted to GSF through the GlobeSet System. In addition, it may be used
to review account balances and transaction histories and to access and make entries on GSF's electronic bulletin
board.
 In the event that the GlobeSet System is unavailable due to operational difficulties, instructions may be sent to
GSF via facsimile transmission. GSF will only accept such instructions if, among other things, they are signed by
authorized individuals who previously submitted a signature specimen and GSF has verified the contents of the instruction
with such individual.





Operationally, OCC, ICC, and their clearing members will each execute shareholder agreements with GSF which will
provide, among other things, that shares in the funds acquired by an OCC or ICC clearing member will be deposited in
OCC's or ICC's primary account via book-entry.
 OCC or ICC will hold such shares as the ``registered owner'' (within the meaning of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial
Code) as security for the obligations of the depositing clearing member in accordance with OCC's and ICC's rules.
Upon receipt of a margin withdrawal request made by a clearing member in accordance with OCC's or ICC's rules, OCC or
ICC will transfer the shares back to the clearing member via book-entry transfer after the clearing member's margin
requirement ends or the clearing member deposits other collateral.






Liquidation of shares in each GSF portfolio may be accomplished by one of four means: (i) Redeeming shares for payment
in the designated currency;
 (ii) redeeming shares for payment in securities held by the portfolios (subject to the approval of GSF's investment
adviser); (iii) selling shares to a counterparty identified through GSF's electronic bulletin board; or (iv) effecting
a matched transfer with a counterparty identified through GSF's electronic bulletin board. GSF will fund liquidations
accomplished by the means specified in (i) and (ii) above from payments received on the sale of shares issued by a portfolio,
proceeds from maturing portfolio securities, proceeds from the sale of portfolio securities, and proceeds of borrowings
by a portfolio that are collateralized by portfolio securities.






OCC and ICC believe the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because
the proposed rule changes will accommodate clearing members by providing them another alternative by which to meet
their margin requirements because OCC's and ICC's portfolio of margin collateral will be further diversified.



B. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition



OCC and ICC do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule changes, and non have
been received.

AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Pilgrim Institutional Trust (formerly, Pilgrim State Tax-Free Trust (the ``Trust'')), Pilgrim Magnacap Fund,
Pilgrim GNMA Fund, Pilgrim Global Investment Series (on behalf of Pilgrim Short-Term Multi-Market Income Fund and
Pilgrim Short-Term Multi-Market Income Fund II), Pilgrim Corporate Utilities Fund, and Pilgrim Strategic Investment
Series (on behalf of Pilgrim High Yield Trust) (collectively with the Trust, the ``Existing Pilgrim Funds''); Pilgrim
Management Corporation (the ``Adviser''); and Pilgrim Distributors Corp. (the ``Distributor'').

Amended order requested under section 6(c) for exemptions from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 18(f), 18(g), 18(i),
22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants previously received relief permitting the Trust and the Existing Pilgrim Funds to issue two classes of
shares, and permitting the Trust to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a contingent deferred sales charge
(``CDSC'') on one of those classes (the ``Prior Order'').
 In addition, the Existing Pilgrim Funds previously received exemptive relief to assess and waive a CDSC under certain
circumstances.
 Applicants request an amendment of the previous orders to permit applicants (a) to issue and sell multiple classes
of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of investments, and (b) to assess and waive a CDSC on certain
redemptions of shares not already covered by the previous orders. Applicants request that any relief granted pursuant

Applicants' Representations


1. The Trust and the Existing Pilgrim Funds are registered open-end management investment companies. The Adviser,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Group, Inc., provides investment management services to the Trust and the Existing
Pilgrim Funds. The Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Group, Inc. and a registered broker/dealer,
acts as principal underwriter for the Trust and the Existing Pilgrim Funds.
2. Under the Prior Order, the Existing Pilgrim Funds currently offer two classes of shares (``Class A'' shares and
``Class B'' shares). Class A (or the ``Front-End Load Option'') shares are subject to a front-end sales load and an
annual fee of up to .25% of the average daily net asset value of such shares under a distribution plan adopted under rule
12b-1 of the Act (``12b-1 Plan''). Class B shares are subject to a CDSC ranging from 3% to 5% (but which may
be higher or lower) for a period of up to six years. Class B shares also are subject to an annual fee of up to 1% of the average
daily net asset value of such shares under a 12b-1 Plan. All references to Class A shares and Class B shares are
to such classes of shares currently offered under the Prior Order.
3. Applicants propose to amend the Prior Order to enable the Funds to offer a multiple class distribution system as
described below (the ``Multi-Class System''). Under the Multi-Class System, in addition to the Class A and Class
B shares, applicants will offer a third class of shares (``Class C''). Class C shares would have a higher minimum initial
purchase amount, and would be subject to a CDSC expected to be equal to 1% during the first year after the initial purchase,
and no CDSC thereafter. Class C shares also would be subject to an annual fee of up to 1% of the average daily net asset
value of such shares under a 12b-1 Plan (collectively with Class B, the ``Deferred Option'').
4. The 1% distribution fee applicable to Deferred Option shares is a combination of asset-based sales charges and
service fees assessed under a 12b-1 Plan. In all cases applicants will comply with Article III, Section 26 of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Rules of Fair Practice as it relates to the maximum amount of
asset-based sales charges and service fees that may be imposed. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July
7, 1992).
5. Under the Multi-Class System, applicants also from time to time may create one or more additional classes of shares,
the terms of which may differ from the Class A shares, Class B shares, and Class C shares only in the following respects:
(a) Each class may bear different fees payable under the applicable 12b-1 Plans, or different fees payable under
a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan (``Shareholder Services Plan''), (b) each class may bear different
Class Expenses, as defined below, (c) each class will vote separately with respect to a Fund's 12b-1 Plan, (d)
each class may have different exchange privileges, and (e) each class may have a different designation. Shares of
different classes may be sold under different sales arrangements (including, for example, subject to a front-end
sales charge, a CDSC, or no sales load).
6. Each class of shares of the Funds will bear, 

pro rata

 based on the relative net asset value of the respective classes, all of the expenses of the Funds except that each class
will bear different Class Expenses and the holders of Deferred Option shares will bear a proportionately higher share
of the distribution fee than the holders of the Front-End Load Option shares. Class Expenses shall be limited to: (i)
Transfer agency fees (including the incremental cost of monitoring a CDSC applicable to a specific class of shares),
(ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class, (iii) SEC and blue sky registration fees incurred
by a class of shares, (iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders
of a specific class, (v) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares, (vi) trustees'/directors'
fees incurred or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares, (vii) accounting fees
and expenses relating to a specific class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified
that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 
7. Because of the additional expenses that will be borne solely by the Deferred Option shares, the net income attributable
to and the dividends payable on the Deferred Option shares for financial statement reporting purposes is expected
to be lower than the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Class A shares. For tax purposes, however,
the difference between the distribution fees payable by Deferred Option shares and the distribution fees payable
by Class A shares (

i.e.,

 up to .75%) is not deductible and will be charged to the Deferred Option shares' paid-in-capital. As a result, Deferred
Option shares will be receiving dividends which in part can be considered return of capital under the SEC's financial
reporting rules. It is therefore expected that the net asset value per share of the multiple classes will diverge over
time. Assuming no change in existing tax laws or relevant interpretations of the SEC's financial reporting rules,
any Fund that issues two or more classes of shares similarly will capitalize rule 12b-1 fees for tax purposes.

8. The Funds will offer exchange privileges to shareholders in each of their classes as described in the application
and in each Fund's prospectus. All exchanges will comply with section 11(a) of the Act or rule 11a-3 thereunder.

9. The Funds may offer classes of shares to one or more of the following five limited categories of investors (``Institutional
Investors''): (a) Unaffiliated benefit plans such as qualified retirement plans, other than individual retirement
accounts (``IRA''s) and self-employed retirement plans, with total assets in excess of $10 million or such other
amounts as the Funds may establish and with such other characteristics as the Funds may establish; (b) tax-exempt
retirement plans of the Adviser and its affiliates, including the retirement plans of the Adviser's affiliated brokers;
(c) banks and insurance companies purchasing for their own accounts; (d) investment companies not affiliated with
the Adviser; and (e) endowment funds of non-profit organizations. These shares (``Institutional Shares'') may
be offered under a variation of the Front-End Load Option, the Deferred Option or a no-load option, and may be subject
to shareholder services fees under a Shareholder Services Plan.

10. In addition, the Funds may offer classes of shares to institutions not included in the categories of Institutional
Investors, such as corporations, foundations, and financial institutions, designed to meet the needs of such institutions
(``Financial Shares''). Class A, Class B, and Class C shares and any future classes of shares which are not Institutional
Shares or Financial Shares are referred to collectively as ``Non-Institutional Shares.''

11. The unaffiliated benefit plans in category (a) of paragraph 9 above will have several common features. Such plans
will have total assets in excess of $10 million or such other amounts as applicants may establish, a separate trustee
for the plan who is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets, certain limitations on the ability of plan
beneficiaries to access their plan investments without incurring adverse tax consequences, and such other characteristics
as the Funds may establish. Applicants will exclude self-directed plans from this category.

12. The tax-exempt retirement plans in category (b) of paragraph 9 above will consist of qualified defined contribution
plans maintained, pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), by the
Adviser or its affiliates for the benefit of employees. Under such plans, the assets are held in trust by a trustee and
employees have limited pre-retirement access to the assets.

13. The entities included in categories (c), (d), and (e) of paragraph 9 above will not be affiliated with the Adviser.
These offerees will have in common the essential features of substantial assets under management and investment
decisionmaking by institutional management on behalf of the entity with respect to the purchase of Institutional
Shares of a Fund. Banks and insurance companies typically employ professional staff to manage the investment of cash
assets, and portfolio managers make investment decisions on behalf of investment companies. Likewise, an endowment
fund of a non-profit organization is professionally managed and individual donors to such endowment funds exercise
no investment discretion on behalf of the endowment fund, nor would such an individual donor consider a direct investment
in shares of a Fund as an investment alternative in lieu of a donation. Thus, no possibility exists that an individual
investor would be able to use these entities as a conduit for individual investing in the Institutional Shares.

14. Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to invest in Institutional Shares. All other investors will be
eligible to invest solely in Non-Institutional Shares and/or Financial Shares. There will be no overlap between
the investors eligible to invest in Institutional Shares and investors eligible to invest in Non-Institutional
Shares and Financial Shares of any Fund.

15. Pursuant to the existing orders, applicants may assess and under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on certain
redemptions of shares. Applicants seek exemptive relief to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC
on certain redemptions of any class of Deferred Option shares of the Funds, and to waive or reduce the CDSC with respect
to certain types of redemptions.

16. The amount of any CDSC will depend on the number of years since the investor made the purchase payment from which
an amount is being redeemed and the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption as set forth in a Fund's prospectus.






17. No CDSC will be imposed on (a) redemptions of shares purchased more than a specified period prior to their redemption
or (b) Deferred Option shares derived from reinvestment of distributions. Further, no CDSC will be imposed on any
amount representing an increase in the value of a shareholder's account due to capital appreciation. In determining
the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital
appreciation, next of shares representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, and finally
of shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time.


18. The Funds request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC in the following instances: (a) On redemptions following
the death or disability of a shareholder, as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Code; (b) in connection with mandatory
distributions from an IRA or other qualified retirement plan; (c) on redemptions pursuant to the Funds' right to liquidate
accounts or charge an annual small account fee; and (d) upon the liquidation or dissolution of a Fund. If the Funds waive
or reduce the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in the class specified.


19. If a Fund discontinues any waiver described above, the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately
revised. Any Deferred Option shares purchased prior to the termination of such waiver would be able to have the CDSC
waived as provided in such Fund's prospectus at the time of the purchase of such shares.




Applicants' Legal Analysis




1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of multiple classes of shares
representing interests in the Funds might be deemed: (a) To result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within
the meaning of section 18(g) and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions
of section 18(i).


2. Applicants believe that the proposed Multi-Class System would better enable the Funds to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Applicants assert that the proposed arrangement would permit the
Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the
method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks. Moreover, applicants state that owners of shares may be relieved under the Multi-Class System of a portion
of the fixed costs normally associated with mutual funds since such costs would, potentially, be spread over a greater
number of shares than would otherwise be the case.


3. Applicants believe that the proposed Multi-Class System does not raise any of the legislative concerns that section
18 of the Act was designed to address. The Multi-Class System will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Funds. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets or
reserves.

Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) the differences in the distribution fees payable by a Fund to the Distributor attributable to each class
pursuant to the 12b-1 Plans adopted and proposed to be adopted by the Fund, or differences in fees payable by each
class under a Shareholder Services Plan that may be adopted and operated in the future in the manner prescribed by condition
16 below; (b) each class may bear different Class Expenses which shall be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees (including
the incremental cost of monitoring a CDSC applicable to a specific class of shares), (ii) printing and postage expenses
related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current
shareholders of a specific class, (iii) SEC and blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) the expenses
of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (v) litigation
or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of share, (vi) trustees'/directors' fees or expenses incurred
as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares, (vii) accounting fees and expenses relating to a specific
class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated
to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (c) each class will vote separately with
respect to a Fund's 12b-1 Plan; (d) each class may have different exchange privileges; and (e) the designation
of each class of shares of a Fund.

2. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees
which are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Trustees shall review,
at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

3. The Trustees of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent Trustees, will approve the subsequent
creation of any additional class of shares. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of the Fund regarding the deliberations
of the Trustees with respect to the approval necessary to implement the Multi-Class system will reflect in detail
the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both
the Funds and their respective shareholders.

4. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts of interest among any outstanding classes of shares.
The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their
own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or service of a particular class of shares
will be used to justify any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale
or service of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class.
The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of
the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution and service
payments relating to any particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and except that any Class
Expenses will be borne exclusively by the applicable classes of shares.
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such
methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate
manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the
calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to
the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as
part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 39(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of
the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to make), will be available
for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division
of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief
Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and
Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,''
and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on the policies and procedures placed in operation and test of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA
from time to time.
8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.
9. The prospectus for each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to
one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.
10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of each class may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. Such
compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase Institutional Shares will be sold only
Institutional Shares, and all investors eligible to purchase Non-Institutional Shares or Financial Shares will
be sold only Non-Institutional Shares or Financial Shares.
11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Trustees.
12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares other than Institutional
Shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Institutional
Shares will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for Institutional Shares will disclose
the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will disclose the existence
of Institutional Shares and will identify the persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. Each Fund will
disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report.
The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information
related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared
on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature
describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except Institutional Shares. Advertising
materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only to those persons
eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper
or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares, except Institutional
Shares, separately.

13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their 12b-1
Plans or any Shareholder Services Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

14. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (see Investment Company
Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

15. Applicants will comply with section 19(a) and rule 19a-1 under the Act, including the provisions requiring
dividend payments that include a return of capital to be accompanied by a written statement clearly indicating that
investors are receiving a return of capital and identifying what portion of the payment is a return of capital.

16. If in the future any investment company adopts a shareholder services plan that is not a 12b-1 Plan, such shareholder
services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b) through
(f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders need not enjoy
the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval on a Temporary Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Extending a Pilot Program Relating to the Handling
of Physical Securities and Paper Transactions for Participants Located in New York City</DOCTITLE>



January 31, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on December 23, 1993, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and
II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. On January 27, 1994 NSCC filed an amendment to the proposal.
 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated
approval of the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through January 31, 1995. This approval order supersedes
a previous order that approved the pilot program until April 30, 1994.








I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will allow NSCC (1) to continue to operate the pilot program relating to the handling of physical
securities and paper transactions for participants located in New York City and (2) to expand the program to offer
limited money settlement services to two participants.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Background



On April 26, 1993, the Commission approved until April 30, 1994, NSCC's proposed rule change that established its
pilot program to provide direct clearing type services for participants located in New York City (``New York Window''
or ``NYW'').
 NSCC was asked by several participants to provide such services because New York City participants have been experiencing
a continual decline in their activities associated with the processing of physical securities. This decline in activities
is a result of the increasing depository eligibility of securities that previously had been settled physically.
Consequently, these participants no longer find it desirable to maintain their own window operations. NSCC originally
requested approval of the NYW program on a pilot basis because NSCC was seeking to operate the individual participants'
window programs at NSCC. After operating the pilot for a period of time, NSCC was to evaluate the program to determine
whether any changes should be made and whether to expand and standardize the operations. NSCC is still in the process
of evaluating the NYW program and at this time is not ready to implement a standardized, proprietary program to replace
the individual participants' operations.
 Therefore, NSCC is requesting that the NYW pilot program be extended.






2. Limited Money Settlement Service



At the request of a participant, NSCC studied the feasibility of providing limited money settlement services. NSCC
found that it is feasible to provide such services and, therefore, will provide the following limited money settlement
services to two participants on a limited basis.






To the extent that the NYW processes ``receives'' that result in next-day funds debits for each participant, NSCC
will issue a check in payment of such debits. NSCC will not issue such checks until it has verified the receipt of same-day
funds from each participant in an amount equal to the gross amount of each participant's payment obligations for that
day. To the extent that the NYW processes ``deliveries'' that result in next-day funds credits for each participant,
NSCC will pay each participant the aggregate amount of all checks received and deposited by NSCC for the participant
each day. The payments will be made in same-day funds on the day following receipt and deposit by NSCC of the checks.
To the extent that receives or deliveries processed by the NYW result in same-day funds debits and credits, the wire
transfers will continue to be made directly between the NYW participants and the other parties to the transactions.

NSCC has stated that the proposed rule change will be implemented consistent with NSCC's statutory obligation under
section 17A of the Act to safeguard securities and funds in NSCC's custody or control.

<TEXT>
 

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC does not believe a burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No comments were received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Section 17A(a)(1)(B) of the Act sets forth Congress findings that inefficient procedures for clearance and settlement
of securities transactions impose unnecessary costs on investors and persons facilitating transactions by and
acting on behalf of investors.
 The Commission reasserts its belief, as stated in the previous New York Window approval order, that NSCC's proposed
pilot program should help minimize inefficient procedures employed by individual New York City participants by
concentrating these operations in one centralized facility.
 In addition, the Commission also believes that the limited money settlement service should provide a more efficient
mechanism by which the two participants can settle their debits and credits generated by the NYW processing.






Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds which are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.
 The Commission believes that the safety procedures established for the pilot program and approved in the previous
New York Window approval order 
 continue to enable NSCC to meet its obligations under the Section 17A of the Act. In addition, the Commission believes
the safeguards NSCC will employ in providing limited money settlement services to the two participants also enable
NSCC to fulfill its safeguarding obligations. For example, NSCC will not make any payment on behalf of or to the limited
money settlement services participants until NSCC has received funds sufficient to cover the amount of NSCC's payment.






NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because the Commission has previously published notice of and has approved the NYW pilot program. NSCC's
previous proposed rule change did not generate any comment letters, and none are expected on this proposal. The limited
money settlement services have not been previously noticed or approved; however, the Commission does not believe
the services raised any controversial issues. In addition, accelerated approval will allow the two participants
to begin utilizing the new service immediately and to begin benefitting from the efficient and centralized payment
procedures provided by NSCC. During the temporary approval period, NSCC will continue to evaluate the New York Window
program and the limited money settlement services.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, and at the principal offices of NSCC. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-93-14 and should be submitted by March 1, 1994.



V. Conclusion



It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-93-14) be, and hereby is, approved until January
31, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement; Integrated Resource Plan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Tennessee Valley Authority.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on its Integrated Resource
Plan (IRP) in concert with the preparation of the IRP. The IRP will establish TVA's long-range energy strategy and
will meet the requirements of section 113 of the Energy Policy Act, Public Law No. 102-486. The IRP will evaluate
the means of providing electric energy services, including demand-side management programs, to meet the demand
for future electric energy services by TVA's customers. The EIS will consider the potential environmental impacts
of alternative energy resource strategies. TVA is inviting comments on the scope of the EIS analyses.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
TVA Power System



TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the United States, charged by Congress with promoting the proper use and conservation
of the resources of the Tennessee Valley region. One component of TVA's regional development program is the generation,
transmission, and sale of electric energy. TVA operates one of the largest electric power systems in the country,
producing four to five percent of all the electricity in the Nation.

TVA's power system serves about eight million people in a seven-State region. The TVA Act requires the TVA power system
to be self-supporting and operated on a nonprofit basis and directs TVA to sell power at rates as low as are feasible.

Dependable capacity on the TVA power system is about 25 million kilowatts, and consists of approximately 58 percent
coal, 21 percent hydro (including the pumped storage unit and certain units operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers),
13 percent nuclear, and 8 percent combustion turbines. TVA expects to initiate operations at Unit 1 of its Watts Bar
Nuclear Plant and to recommence operations at Unit 3 of its Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in the near future. TVA transmits
electricity it generates over 16,000 miles of transmission lines to 160 local municipal and rural cooperative electric
systems (``distributors'' of TVA power) which in turn retail the power to individual consumers (homes, factories,
schools, hospitals, etc.). TVA also directly serves 68 large industries and Federal installations. Like other utility
systems, TVA has power interchange agreements with the utilities surrounding its region, and it purchases and sells
power on an economy basis almost daily.



Previous Energy Planning Activities



TVA has employed a largely internal integrated resource planning and study process for many years. Information from
this process has been used to propose energy resource decisions. Under the 1992 Energy Policy Act, TVA is directed
to continue employing an integrated planning process. This Act also requires TVA to provide distributors of TVA power
an opportunity to participate in the process.

TVA prepares individual environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for proposed
energy decisions. As appropriate, information from TVA's IRP analyses is used in these environmental reviews. TVA
has committed to employing a public IRP process and has decided that use of the EIS process under NEPA would be an appropriate
means of obtaining public involvement in the planning and decisionmaking processes. Preparing an IRP EIS will also
promote consideration of the environmental impacts of alternatives, and will allow TVA to use the IRP/EIS with other
NEPA reviews for future specific energy decisions or projects.

Proposed IRP/EIS



An ``IRP'' is simply a plan which broadly identifies the actions a utility anticipates undertaking to meet demands
for electric service and to achieve its long-term objectives or goals. The most important objective for TVA's IRP
is to maintain and enhance its competitiveness. TVA views ``competitiveness'' broadly and believes it has a number
of components, including charging rates for the electricity it generates that will be among the lowest in the Nation,
providing reliable service that meets its customers' needs, ensuring that its activities are cost effective and
produce value for its customers, promoting sustainable economic growth in the TVA region, and accomplishing all
of the above consistent with TVA's goal of being an environmental leader.

In general, TVA expects the IRP/EIS to address the demand for power on the TVA system (how much electricity TVA will
be called upon to provide in the future), the value of various resource options to TVA's customers, the means of meeting
that demand (alternatives), and the potential environmental, economic, and operating effects of those means. The
IRP/EIS will project future energy demands over at least a 25-year period. These projections will be made through
``load forecasts'' and the IRP/EIS will explain how these are conducted. In addition, the IRP will include a short-term
action plan that will identify actions or activities which should be undertaken to meet IRP milestones or preserve
energy options.

The IRP/EIS will identify and address the energy resources on the TVA system including existing resources and those
which are currently under construction. Based on the results of the IRP/EIS, TVA may, for example, decide to operate
an existing resource differently or not operate it, or may decide to accelerate, modify, or cancel ongoing energy
resource construction projects. In the interim, TVA will continue to serve its customers. 

At this time, we anticipate that the IRP/EIS process will focus on at least three important areas: (1) Demand-side
management measures and electrotechnologies that will promote more efficient use of energy; (2) generating resources,
including restart of Browns Ferry Unit 1, completion of TVA's Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit 2 and Bellefonte Nuclear
Plant Units 1 and 2, and major improvement projects at fossil and hydro plants; and (3) new technologies on both the
supply and demand side such as clean coal technologies, biomass generation, improved lighting, more efficient motors,
and electric vehicles. The IRP/EIS will consider such things as the potential effects of non-utility generation
and dispersed power, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and other significant legislation, fuel prices, and conservation
penetration rates.

Environmental effects of a range of alternative energy strategies will be addressed in the IRP/EIS and compared to
one another. Because of the programmatic nature of the proposal and review process, TVA anticipates that the environmental
effects which are examined will be those that are regional national, or global in scale or which are generic. This would
include such potential environmental effects and issues as emissions of greenhouse gases, acid rain, other air quality
concerns, water quality effects, waste generation and disposal, and pollution prevention. Socioeconomic impacts
within the region that may result from alternative energy strategies would also be considered. The more site-specific
effects (those which depend on the specific location of a proposed action such as the construction of a new generating
facility) will not be addressed in detail or not at all. This would include such things as potential effects on wetlands,
floodplains, prime farmlands, threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources.



Scoping Process



TVA is interested in receiving comments on the areas and issues identified above, and the scope of the IRP/EIS. TVA
specifically requests comments on: (1) TVA's overall approach to the IRP process, (2) the kinds of alternatives which
should be evaluated in the IRP/EIS, (3) the significant environmental impacts and issues which should be assessed
in the IRP/EIS, and (4) the environmental impacts and issues which should be considered unimportant or insignificant
for the IRP/EIS.

It is important the TVA's customers and all of those interested in planning the energy future of the Tennessee Valley
region participate in the IRP/EIS process. As part of both the scoping and draft EIS review processes, TVA intends
to seek out the views of and meet regularly with representatives of ``stakeholder'' groups interested in the energy
and environmental future of the Valley. In addition, numerous opportunities will be made available to the general
public to provide input into and comments on the IRP/EIS as it proceeds.

Following completion of scoping, a Draft IRP/EIS will be prepared and released for public review and comment. Notice
of the availability of this draft will be announced, comments on the draft solicited, and information about additional
public meetings/hearings will be published at a future date. TVA contemplates releasing a Final EIS and IRP in late
1995.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>

Trade Agreement in order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


Chapter Nineteen of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for
replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from
Canada or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously
review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty
law of the importing country. Title IV of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement Implementation Agreement
Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-449, 102 Stat. 1851 (1988) amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen
of the Agreement. 
The 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

are intended to give effect to the panel review provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the
procedures for commencing, conducting and completing panel reviews. Originally published on December 30, 1988
(53 FR 53212), the rules became effective on January 1, 1989, the date the Agreement entered into force. As a result
of negotiations between the United States and Canada and, taking into account comments received from panelists and
counsel for participants in panel reviews, the rules have been amended twice (54 FR 53165, Dec. 27, 1989; and 57 FR 26698,
June 15, 1992). The further amendments to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

contained in this notice are the result of negotiations between the United States and Canada prompted by the desire
to modify certain procedures in the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules. 

Consequently, these amendments improve the panel review process. 
A summary of the amendments to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

is contained in the following section-by-section analysis. Amendments involving typographical errors, corrected
cross-referencing, minor ministerial corrections, and any other changes not explained below, are considered drafting
clarifications and have no substantive significance. 


Preamble 


The Preamble has been amended to incorporate the amendments contained herein into the legislative history of the


Article 1904 Panel Rules. 


Rule 1A 


Rule 1A has been added in view of the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA'') and in light
of the possibility that a Party may withdraw from NAFTA. The Article 1904 Panel Rules 

govern panel review of any final determination published or, in the case of a determination that is not published,
for which notice is received, prior to the entry into force of the NAFTA. If either Canada or the United States were to
withdraw from the NAFTA, the Agreement would revive between them and these rules again would apply. 


Rule 2 


Rule 2 has been amended by deleting the provision that the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the panels. This provision is inconsistent with rule
7. As amended, the final sentence of rule 2 clarifies that the Agreement prevails where there is an inconsistency or
ambiguity between the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

and the Agreement. 


Rule 2A 


Rule 2A has been added to provide that these amendments to the rules shall not apply to any panel proceeding pending
on January 1, 1994 where, in the opinion of the panel, their application would be impracticable or would be prejudicial
to a participant. 


Rule 3 


The definition of ``Disclosure Undertaking'' has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the undertaking
in the body of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

or in an attached schedule. 
The definition of ``investigating authority'' has been amended to include a delegation of power by the competent
investigating authority in matters regarding the issuance, amendment, modification and revocation of Disclosure
Orders and Protective Orders. 
The definition of ``Protective Order Application'' has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the
application in the body of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

or in an attached schedule. 
The definition of ``service address'' has been rephrased to clarify that an address, rather than a facsimile number,
is the principal service address. 
The definition of ``service list'' with respect to a panel review where the final determination was made in Canada
has been amended to clarify that the panel review process is restricted to goods of the United States. 


Rule 15 


Subrule 15(a) has been amended to ensure that a document containing proprietary or privileged information filed
with the responsible Secretariat is treated in accordance with the terms of an applicable Disclosure Order or Protective
Order.

Rule 22 



In subrule 22(1), the cross-reference to rule 52 has been deleted because a person now must file with the responsible
Secretariat one original and eight copies of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order, or any amendment or modification
thereto, or notice of revocation thereof. The cross-reference to subrule 75(2)(a) was added because only one copy
of a supplementary remand record must be filed. 



Rule 23 



Rule 23 has been amended to clarify the responsibilities of the responsible Secretary for the service of documents.
Under subrule (a), the responsible Secretary is no longer required to serve Complaints other than on the Parties.
Now, a complainant is required under subrule 24(5) to serve a Complaint on the investigating authority and on all persons
on the service list. Subrule 23(c) has been amended so that the responsible Secretary serves Notices of Appearance
only on the participants. 

Subrule 23(d) has been amended to require that the responsible Secretary serve participants only with those Disclosure
Orders and Protective Orders, any amendments or modifications thereto, and notices of revocation thereof granted
to panelists, court reporters or translators. Now, subrule 24(1) provides that participants must serve their own
Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders, any amendments or modifications thereto, and notices of revocation thereof.
Subrule 23(d) also has been amended to require that the responsible Secretary serve participants with Notices of
Final Panel Action. 



Rule 24 



Subrule 24(1) has been amended to add supplementary remand records to the list of documents exempt from the service
requirements of subrule (1). Subrule (5) has been added to provide that a complainant, and not the responsible Secretary,
is required to serve a Complaint on the investigating authority and on all persons listed on the service list. 



Rule 33 



Subrule 33(1)(a) has been amended to conform with the statutory requirement that a party provide timely notice of
its intent to commence judicial review in cases involving Canadian merchandise. 19 U.S.C. 1516a(g)(3)(B). An interested
person who intends to commence judicial review of a final determination made in the United States must serve a Notice
of Intent to Commence Judicial Review on both Secretaries, the investigating authority, and all persons listed on
the service list within 20 days of the date the final determination was published in the 

Federal Register

, or within 20 days of the date on which notice of the final determination was received by the other Party if the final
determination was not published in the 

Federal Register

. 



Rule 35 



Subrule 35(1)(c)(ii) has been amended to clarify that any person who does not file a Complaint but intends to participate
in the panel review must file a Notice of Appearance. 



Rule 36 



Rule 36, which provided for joint panel review of final determinations of dumping or subsidization with final determinations
of affirmative injury, has been removed because the procedure had never been applied successfully in any panel review.




Rule 37 



Rule 37 requires joint panel review where a final affirmative antidumping or countervailing duty determination
for a particular good and a final negative injury determination for that same good are both subject to a request for
panel review.

<DOCNO> FR940208-2-00143 </DOCNO>

Rule 38 



Rule 38, which provides for the applicable periods in joint panel reviews, has been amended to account for the removal
of rule 36, to clarify the event triggering the time period fixed for joint panel review pursuant to rule 37 and to provide,
on motion, for the possibility of alternative time periods for final antidumping or countervailing duty determinations
subject to joint panel review. 

Subrule 38(1) provides that in a joint panel review pursuant to rule 37, the time period fixed for review of the final
negative injury determination applies to both panel reviews. This subrule has been amended to specify that the time
period fixed for a joint panel review commences with the date fixed for filing briefs under rule 60. 

Subrule 38(2) now incorporates the substance of former subrule 38(3) and provides that in a joint panel review, the
decision on the final negative injury determination will be issued first, unless the panel orders a different timetable.
Subrule 38(2) also provides that where there is a Determination on Remand and where that Determination on Remand is
affirmative, the panel will then issue its decision on the final antidumping or countervailing duty determination.


Subrule 38(3) has been added to allow participants to bring a motion requesting that alternate time periods be fixed
for review of the final antidumping or countervailing duty determination. Subrule 38(4) has been added to specify
the time period fixed for filing such a motion. Subrule 38(5) has been added to provide that where a panel has not issued
a ruling on such a motion within 30 days or has not otherwise ordered, the motion is deemed denied and the timing set out
in subrules 38(1) and (2) applies. 



Rule 39 



Subrule 39(1) has been amended to require that, in addition to filing the Complaint with the responsible Secretary,
the complainant is now required serve the Complaint on the investigating authority and on all persons listed on the
service list. 

Subrule (4) has been amended to indicate that the time period for filing an amended Complaint is mandatory. 

The substance of subrule (5) has been split into subrules (5) and (6) for greater clarity. Subrule (5) addresses the
period within which an amended Complaint may be filed out of time. Subrule (6) sets out the procedure for seeking leave
to file an amended Complaint. 



Rule 40 



Subrule 40(1)(c) has been amended to clarify the reasons for which a Notice of Appearance may be filed. Subrule (2)
has been amended to reflect the amendments made consequentially to subrule (1)(c). 



Rule 41 



Rule 41 has been amended to streamline the procedures for filing and service of the record for review. Subrule (1) has
been amended to remove the requirement that a Designation of Record be filed and to extend the time period for filing
an Index to 15 days after the deadline for filing Notices of Appearance. Consequently, the investigating authority
is now required to file the following documents with the responsible Secretariat within 15 days after the expiration
of the time period fixed for filing a Notice of Appearance: nine copies of the final determination, two copies of an
Index, and two copies of the administrative record. As well, the investigating authority is now required to serve
a copy of the Index on all participants. 

New subrule (4) addresses the filing of privileged information and has been amended to provide that the investigating
authority may waive its privilege and voluntarily file privileged information in a panel review. 



Rule 43 



Rule 43 has been amended consequentially to the amendments to rule 41. Rule 43, which addressed the filing of a portion
of the administrative record, has been removed because rule 41 now requires that two complete copies of the record
are to be filed with the responsible Secretary. 



Rule 45 



Rule 45 has been amended to clarify that assistants to panelists are covered by the Code of Conduct and to specify that
a participant is required to notify the responsible Secretary, not the Parties, of an alleged violation of the Code
of Conduct by a panelist or an assistant. The responsible Secretary is now required to notify the other Secretary and
the Parties of the allegations. This reflects procedures developed by the governments for appropriate handling
of such allegations. 



Rule 48 



Subrule 48(b) has been amended to limit filings of Disclosure Undertakings and Protective Order Applications with
the Secretary to one original and any additional copies that the investigating authority requires. Because the definitions
of Disclosure Undertaking and Protective Order Application have been revised to indicate that the forms are available
from the investigating authority, there is no longer a need for Schedules A or B. 



Rule 51 



Subrule 51(2) has been amended to clarify that the panel may consider not only whether the terms of a Disclosure Order
or Protective Order should be modified, but also whether they should be amended. 

Subrule 51(3) has been amended to clarify the powers of a panel where a final determination is made in the United States
and the competent investigating authority fails to comply with a panel notification to issue or modify a Disclosure
Order or Protective Order. If the panel disagrees with the investigating authority's handling of a Disclosure Undertaking
or Protective Order Application, the only sanction it can take is against the investigating authority. The sanction
cannot be detrimental to the interests of the other participants in the panel review.

<TEXT>
 

Rule 52 


Subrule 52(2) has been amended to provide that where a Disclosure Order or Protective Order is amended, modified or
revoked, the competent investigating authority shall provide the responsible Secretariat with a copy of the amendment,
modification or Notice of Revocation. 


Rule 53 


Rule 53 has been removed because it was redundant and did not accurately reflect current practice. 


Rule 55 


Subrules 55(3) and 55(5) have been amended to ensure that, where the competent investigating authority files with
the responsible Secretary a document under seal, the two panelists delegated to examine the document have an obligation
to do so. 


Rule 56 


Subrule 56(a) has been amended to make clear that members of the Secretariat staff and others are eligible to receive
access to documents disclosed pursuant to rule 55 and to provide that members of any future Extraordinary Challenge
Committee and their assistants may have access to these documents, if necessary. 
The substance of subrule (b) has been removed to subrule (c). New subrule (b) has been added to specify the procedure
by which a panel identifies who is entitled to access to a document containing privileged information.


Rule 59 


Subrules 59 (1)(b) and (2)(b) have been amended to allow the filing of pleadings containing non-proprietary and non-privileged
information no later than one day after the filing of pleadings containing the proprietary or privileged information.

The cross-referencing in subrule 60(1) has been revised to account for the merging of time lines in joint panel reviews
under subrule 38(1). 



Rule 62 


Subrule 62(1) has been restructured to distinguish between a table of contents and a table of authorities. 



Rule 62A 



Subrule 62A(1) has been amended to clarify the contents and organization of materials contained in an appendix. It
now provides, among other things, that the appendix should include copies of all treaty and statutory references
as well as copies of those cases primarily relied on in the briefs. 



Rule 64 



Rule 64 has been amended to add a cross-reference to subrule 77(5), which provides for no right of response to a motion
for re-examination of a panel order or decision. 


Rule 65 



Rule 65 incorporates the substance of old rule 66.



Rule 66 


New rule 66 incorporates the substance of old rule 65 and has been amended to provide that a panel may hear oral argument
in person as well as by telephone conference call.



Rule 69 


Subrule 69(4) has been added to clarify that oral argument shall be conducted by counsel of record or, where a participant
is an individual who has not retained counsel, by the participant. 



Rule 75 


Subrule 75(4) has been amended by adding the phrase ``after the later of'' to clarify the time period for the issuance
of an order by the panel. In addition, subrule 75(4) has been amended to delete the cross-reference to rule 74 because
rule 74 requires that a panel decision include reasons, which an order affirming uncontested remand results does
not require. 



Rule 77 



Subrules 77 (5), (6) and (7) have been added as a result of the addition of rule 79A, which provides for the issuance of
a Notice of Final Panel Action. Under former subrule 77(5), issuance of a Notice of Completion could effectively deny
a motion under subrule 77(1). Because rule 79A could have the effect of denying a motion under subrule 77(1), new subrule
77(5) has been added to clarify that there is no right of response to a motion for re-examination of a panel order or decision
except at the discretion of the panel.

<TEXT>
 

Subrule 77(6) has been added to specify the procedure a panel shall follow on a motion for re-examination of a decision,
including a seven-day deadline to conform with the new scheme set forth in rule 79A. 
To prevent a situation in which fewer than all five panelists are available, subrule 77(7) has been added to provide
that the concurrence of only three panelists is required to issue a decision or order on a motion for re-examination.



Rule 79A 


Rule 79A provides for the issuance of a Notice of Final Panel Action. This rule has been added because the panel rules
did not clearly set out when the time period begins to run for filing a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee.
Now, issuance of a rule 79A Notice will begin the time period for filing such a Request. Subrule 79A(1) provides that
when a panel issues what it considers to be its last order or decision, the panel shall direct the responsible Secretary
to issue a Notice of Final Panel Action on the eleventh day thereafter. Issuance of this Notice on the eleventh day is
provided for because under subrule 77(1) participants may file a motion for re-examination of the panel's last decision
within 10 days after a panel issues its decision. Subrule 79A(2) provides for the issuance of a Notice of Final Panel
Action in cases where a motion for re-examination is filed pursuant to subrule 77(1). 

Rule 80 


Rule 80, which provides for the publication of a Notice of Completion of Panel Review, has been amended as a result of
the addition of rule 79A. Subrule 80(a) provides that a Notice of Completion of Panel Review is effective on the day
on which a panel review is terminated by consent of all participants. Subrule (a) takes into account the fact that where
all participants consent to termination of panel review, there is no reason to request the establishment of an Extraordinary
Challenge Committee. Subrule (b) provides that in any other case, a Notice of Completion of Panel Review is effective
on the 31st day following the date on which the responsible Secretary issues a Notice of Final Panel Action.

Preamble 



The Parties, 
Having regard to Chapter Nineteen of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States of America; 
Acting pursuant to Article 1904.14 of the Agreement; 
Adopted Rules of Procedure governing all panel reviews conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement; 
Adopt the following amended Rules of Procedure, effective on the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, which from that day shall govern all panel reviews conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement. 


Short Title 



1. These rules may be cited as the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules. 



Application 



1A. These rules apply to a panel review of a final determination, unless any rules of procedure made pursuant to Article
1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement are in force and apply to a panel review of a final determination. 



Statement of General Intent 



2. These rules are intended to give effect to the provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement with respect to panel
reviews conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement and are designed to result in decisions of panels within
315 days after the commencement of the panel review. The purpose of these rules is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive
review of final determinations in accordance with the objectives and provisions of Article 1904. Where a procedural
question arises that is not covered by these rules, a panel may adopt the procedure to be followed in the particular

(a) the date that any Determination on Remand with respect to the same goods is due from the other investigating authority,

of the investigating authority with respect to the making of a final Determination on Remand.

(b) the relief requested; and 
(c) if ascertainable, a statement as to whether other participants consent to the motion.

Motion filed pursuant to subrule (1).

(a) issue a decision ruling on the motion; or 
(b) issue an order identifying further action to be taken concerning the motion.

of time periods shall be suspended, pending the appointment of a substitute panelist in accordance with the procedures
set out in Annex 1901.2 to Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement. 
79. Where a panelist becomes unable to fulfil panel duties, is disqualified or dies after the oral argument, the chairperson

United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement: Amendments to Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge
Committees 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, Binational Secretariat, United States Section, International Trade
Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amendments to rules of procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Canada and the United States have amended the rules of procedure for Annex 1904.13 extraordinary challenge proceedings.
These amendments are intended to improve the extraordinary challenge proceeding process under Chapter Nineteen
of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement in order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


Chapter Nineteen of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for
replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from
Canada or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously
review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty
law of the importing country. 
In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, that
(a)(i) a member of a panel materially violated the rules of conduct, (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental
rule of procedure, or (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction, and that (b) any
of the actions set out in (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational
panel review process, that Party may request formation of an extraordinary challenge committee (``ECC''). Extraordinary
challenge committee review is therefore not a routine appeal. Rather, as the name suggests, the United States or Canada
may have recourse to an ECC only in extraordinary cases. Title IV of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Agreement Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-449, 102 Stat. 1851 (1988) amends United States law
to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement.

The 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 are intended to give effect to the extraordinary challenge committee provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement
by setting forth the procedures for commencing, conducting and completing extraordinary challenge proceedings.
Originally published on December 30, 1988 (53 Fed. Reg. 53212, 53222), the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 became effective on January 1, 1989, the date the Agreement entered into force. These amendments to the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 are the result of negotiations between the United States and Canada. The amendments improve the extraordinary challenge
committee review process by providing for the smooth functioning of that process and by making the rules more easily
understood by counsel. 
A summary of the amendments to the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 is contained in the following section-by-section analysis. Amendments involving typographical errors, corrected
cross-referencing, minor ministerial corrections, and any other changes not explained below, are considered drafting
clarifications and have no substantive significance. 


Preamble 


The Preamble has been amended to clarify that paragraph 2 of Annex 1904.13 provides the mandate for the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules. 


Rule 2 


Rule 2 has been added in view of the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA'') and in light
of the possibility that a Party may withdraw from NAFTA. The Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 govern any proceeding in which a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee is filed in respect of a panel review
of any final determination published or, in the case of a determination that is not published, for which notice is received,
prior to the entry into force of NAFTA. If either Canada or the United States were to withdraw from NAFTA, the Agreement
would revive between them and these rules would again apply. 


Rule 3 


Rule 3 amends former rule 2 to clarify that where procedural questions arise which are not covered by the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules,

 any procedure adopted by a committee should not be inconsistent with the Agreement. 
Rule 3 also has been amended to add a provision corresponding to the final sentence of Rule 2 of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules,

 which provides that the Agreement prevails where there is an inconsistency or ambiguity between the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 and the Agreement. 


Rule 4 


The definition of ``Disclosure Undertaking'' corresponds to an amendment to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules

 and has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the undertaking in the body of the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 or in an attached schedule. 
The definition of ``investigating authority'' corresponds to an amendment to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules

 and has been added to include a delegation of power by the competent investigating authority in matters regarding
the issuance, amendment, modification and revocation of Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders. 
The definition of ``personal information'' has been added to account for a class of information not found in the administrative
record under review by a panel and consists of information produced in respect of a request for an extraordinary challenge
committee arising from an allegation under Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement. 
The definition of ``pleading'' has been amended to remove the Notice of Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee
and to add the Notice of Motion. 
The definition of ``proof of service'', as it applies to an extraordinary challenge proceeding requested in respect
of a panel review of a final determination made in the United States, has been amended to remove acknowledgement of
service as an alternative form of proof of service because it is not standard practice in the United States. 
The definition of ``Protective Order Application'' corresponds to an amendment to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules

 and has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the application in the body of the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules

 or in an attached schedule. 
The definition of ``service address'' has been amended to correspond to an amendment to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules

 and has been rephrased to clarify that an address, rather than a facsimile number, is the principal service address.

Rule 5 



Rule 5, formerly rule 4, provides for the incorporation of the definitions in Article 1911 of the Agreement into the


Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules. 



Rules 6 to 8 



Rules 6 to 8 consolidate the general rules applicable to all extraordinary challenge proceedings. 

Rule 6 provides for the duration of an extraordinary challenge proceeding. 

Rule 7, formerly rule 25, indicates which legal principles govern an extraordinary challenge proceeding. 

Rule 8, formerly rule 26, gives a committee the discretion to review any portion of the panel record. 



Rules 9 and 10 



Rules 9 and 10 consolidate the rules for the routine functioning of committees. 

Rule 9, formerly rule 14, provides that a committee may adopt rules for its own routine administrative matters. 

Rule 10, formerly rule 15, sets out who may participate in the deliberations of a committee. 



Rules 11 and 12 



Rules 11 and 12 provide for the computation of time. 

Rule 11, formerly rule 16, sets out the provisions for computation of time and has been amended to add subrule 11(3),
which provides for the computation of time periods of five days or less. This provision was added due to the relatively
short period of time within which an extraordinary challenge proceeding typically takes place_30 days from the date
of establishment of the committee. 

Rule 12, formerly rule 17, gives a committee the discretion to extend time periods, if certain conditions are met.




Rule 13 



Rule 13, formerly rule 18, sets out the conditions for a counsel to become counsel of record for a participant in an extraordinary
challenge proceeding. 



Rule 14 



Rule 14, formerly rule 31, provides for the allocation of costs. 



Rules 15 to 22 



Rules 15 to 22 provide for the protection of non-public information: proprietary information, privileged information
and personal information. These rules set out the procedures whereby committee members, their assistants, court
reporters and translators, as well as participants in an extraordinary challenge proceeding, may gain access to
this non-public information and the conditions which participants must fulfill in order to gain access to this information.


Subrule 15(1), formerly subrule 11(1), provides for the filing with the responsible Secretary of Disclosure Undertakings
or Protective Order Applications by committee members, their assistants, court reporters and translators who may

Subrule 15(2) has been added to provide that the responsible Secretary shall file the Disclosure Undertaking or the
Protective Order Application with the appropriate investigating authority. 

Subrules 15(3) and (4) address the requirements for issuance of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order. Former subrule
11(3) had provided that the person to whom the Disclosure Order or Protective Order was issued would file with the responsible
Secretariat the order and the required number of copies. Under new subrule 15(3), the investigating authority issues
the appropriate Order and transmit it to the responsible Secretary. 

Under subrule 15(4) the responsible Secretary, on receipt of the appropriate Order, transmits that Order to the person
named in the Order. The rationale for this amendment was to ensure that the Secretary could act as the conduit for assembling,
filing and receipt of Orders for all persons who are not counsel in an extraordinary challenge proceeding. 

Rule 16 has been added to correspond to the procedure under subrules 49(2), 49(3) and 49(4) of the Article 1904 Panel
Rules 

and provides for the amendment and modification of Disclosure Undertakings and Protective Order Applications and
for the amendment, modification or revocation of Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders. 

Under subrule 16(1), a committee member, assistant to a committee member, court reporter, or translator provides
to the responsible Secretariat a copy of any amendment or modification made to a Disclosure Undertaking or Protective
Order Application. 

Under subrule 16(2), the responsible Secretary then files the amendment or modification to the Disclosure Undertaking
or Protective Order Application with the competent investigating authority. 

Under subrule 16(3), the competent investigating authority, as appropriate, amends, modifies or revokes the Disclosure
Order or Protective Order and then transmits to the responsible Secretariat the amended or modified Order or the notice
of revocation of the Order. 

Under subrule 16(4), the responsible Secretary transmits the amended or modified Order or the notice of revocation
of the Order to the person named therein. 

Rule 17 has been added to correspond to the procedure under subrule 23(d) of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

for service by the responsible Secretary of Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders, amendments and modifications
thereto and notices of revocation thereof. 

Rule 18 has been added to correspond to the procedure under rule 48(1) of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

and provides for the issuance of Disclosure Orders or Protective Orders to new counsel of record or any professional
retained by, or under the control of, new counsel of record. A professional retained by counsel refers, for example,
to a professional who is retained on a contractual basis. A professional under the control of counsel refers, for example,
to an employee of counsel who is not hired on a contractual basis, but takes direction from counsel. 

Subrule 18(1) provides that a new counsel of record or such professional shall file a Disclosure Undertaking or Protective
Order Application with the responsible Secretariat and with the competent investigating authority. 

Subrule 18(2) provides that the Disclosure Undertaking or Protective Order Application shall be served on all participants.
Subrule 18(3) limits the competent investigating authority to 10 days after the filing of the Disclosure Undertaking
or Protective Order Application to issue or to transmit reasons for not issuing a Disclosure Order or Protective Order.


Rule 19 has been added to correspond to rule 50 of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules. 

Subrule 19(1) provides that counsel may file a notice of motion requesting that a committee review the decision of
a competent investigating authority refusing to issue a Disclosure Order or Protective Order to persons named in
subrule 18(1) or issuing a Disclosure Order or Protective Order with terms unacceptable to a person named in subrule
18(1). 

Subrule 19(2) provides for notice by a committee to counsel and the competent investigating authority where the committee
decides that an order should be issued or that the terms of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order should be amended
or modified. 

Subrule 19(3) provides that if a United States investigating authority fails to comply with a notice of the committee
set out in subrule 19(2), the committee may issue such orders as are just in the circumstances.

Article 1904 Panel Rules

extraordinary challenge under Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement, shall be kept confidential. 
Rule 22, formerly rule 33, sets out procedures where there have been allegations of violations of the terms of a Disclosure

Secretariat. 
Rule 30, which consolidates former subrules 21(2) and (3) and rule 22, sets out the requirements for service of public
documents. Subrule 30(1) sets out which of the documents filed by a participant are required to be served by that participant
on the other participants. 
Subrule 30(2) sets out three alternative methods of service of the documents set out in subrule 30(1). 
Subrule 30(3) provides that proof of service be set out on all documents served under subrule 30(1). 
Subrule 30(4) sets out the requirements for establishing the date of service where a document is served by special
delivery courier or expedited mail service. 
Rules 31 to 35 consolidate former subrule 21(4) and former rules 23, 47, 48 and 50. The new rules provide for the filing
and service of documents under seal, 

i.e., 

those documents containing personal information, privileged information or proprietary information. 



Subrule 31(1), formerly subrule 47(10), provides that the filing and service of documents under seal are required
to accord with the procedures set out in this subrule and rule 33.

Subrule 31(2), formerly rule 47(2), provides for the binding, marking and wrapping of documents filed under seal.

Subrule 31(3) provides that the opaque inner wrapper containing documents filed under seal shall be labelled to indicated
its contents, 

i.e., 

proprietary information, privileged information, or personal information, and the Secretariat file number. 
Rule 32, formerly rule 48, provides that the filing and service of documents under seal does not waive the privilege
attached to the personal, privileged and proprietary information contained in those documents. 
Subrule 33 (1), formerly subrule 50(1), provides for the filing of pleadings containing proprietary information
and sets out the method for filing each of the two sets of pleadings required. Subrule 33(2), formerly subrule 50(2),
makes similar provisions for privileged information. 
Subrules 33(1)(b) and (2)(b) have been amended to allow the filing of pleadings containing non-proprietary and non-privileged
information no later than one day after the filing of pleadings containing the proprietary or privileged information.

Subrule 33(3), formerly subrule 50(3), makes similar provisions for personal information and sets out the method
for filing the one set of pleadings required. 
Rule 34 has been added to provide for restrictions on service of documents under seal. Subrule 34(1) has been added
to correspond to subrule 24(4) of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules 

and limits service of documents filed under seal to the investigating authority and those participants with Disclosure
Orders or Protective Orders.

Rules 38 to 40 



Rules 38 to 40 provide for requests for extraordinary challenge committees. 

Rule 38, which consolidates portions of former rules 34 and 40 and which provides for request for an extraordinary
challenge committee, has been amended to reflect the addition of rule 79A to the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules.

 Rule 79A provides for the issuance of a Notice of Final Panel Action which triggers the running of the time period for
filing a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee. 

Subrule 38(1), therefore, requires that a Party file a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee referred
to in Article 1904.13(a)(ii) or (iii) within 30 days after the issuance, pursuant to rule 79A of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules,

 of the Notice of Final Panel Action in the panel review that is the subject of the Request. 

Subrule 38(2)(a) requires that a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee referred to in Article 1904.13(a)(i)
also be filed within 30 days after the issuance of the Notice of Final Panel Action. Where, however, a Party gains knowledge
of the action of the panelist giving rise to the allegation under Article 1904.13(a)(i) more than 30 days after the
issuance of a Notice of Final Panel Action, subject to subrule 38(3), subrule 38(2)(b) requires a Party to file the
Request no more than 30 days after gaining knowledge of the action of the panelist. There is a limitation, found in subrule
38(3), which states that no Request pertaining to a panelist's action may be filed if two years or more have elapsed
since the issuance of the Notice of Completion of Final Panel Review pursuant to rule 80 or 81 of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules.

 

Rule 39 consolidates former subrule 35(a) and portions of subrule 40(1) and sets out the information to be contained
in a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee. Subrule 39(2) has been added to provide that where a Request contains
an allegation referred to in Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement, the identity of the panelist against whom such
an allegation is made shall be revealed only in a confidential annex filed together with the Request and shall be disclosed
only in accordance with rule 61. 

Rule 40, which consolidates former subrule 35(b) and portions of former subrule 40(1), provides for the materials
to accompany a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee. 



Rules 41 and 42 



Rules 41 and 42 provide for Notices of Appearance. 

Rule 41 consolidates former rules 37 and 42, and sets out the procedure for filing Notices of Appearance in response
to a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee. 

Subrule 41(1) provides for filing of the Notice and for the information to be contained in the Notice. 

Subrules 41 (2) and (3) provide for the submission of documents on the administrative record of the panel review not
specified in the Index.

Rule 42, formerly rule 43, provides that where a panelist has made a motion for an 

in camera

 hearing and has filed documents under seal in support of that motion, and where the committee denies the motion, the
panelist is permitted to withdraw those documents. 



Rules 43 and 44 



Rules 43 and 44 provide for the filing and content of briefs and appendices. 

Rule 43, formerly rule 38, provides for the filing of briefs and has been amended to provide for the filing of appendices
along with the briefs. 

Rule 44, formerly rule 51, sets out the structure and content of briefs. 

Subrule 44(1) has been amended to add the requirement for binding of briefs. 

Subrule 44(1) has been further amended and subrule 44(3) has been added to clarify the structure and content of a table
of authorities. 



Rule 45 



Rule 45, which amends former rule 52, provides for motions. The new rule clarifies that a committee may dispose of a
motion based on the pleadings and that, if there is oral argument, it may be heard by telephone conference call, so long
as there is no disclosure of personal, privileged or proprietary information.

Rules 46 to 49 



Rules 46 to 49 provide for the conduct of oral proceedings. 

Rule 46, which amends former rule 45, provides for orders of a committee on a motion for 

in camera

 hearings. 

Subrule 46(2) has been added to clarify that the responsible Secretary is not to serve documents containing personal
information filed by a panelist on a motion for an 

in camera

 hearing prior to the time for withdrawal by the panelist of documents filed under seal on the motion. 

Rule 47, formerly rule 46, provides that a committee may decide the procedure to be followed in an extraordinary challenge
proceeding. 

Rule 48, formerly rule 53, provides that oral argument in a committee proceeding is at the discretion of the committee.


Rule 49, formerly rule 54, provides for oral proceedings 

in camera.

 



Rules 50 to 61 



Rules 50 to 61 consolidate and, by amendment, clarify the responsibilities of the Secretary. 

Rule 50 has been added to correspond to rule 8 of the 

Article 1904 Panel Rules,

 which sets out the business hours of the Secretariat. 

Rule 51, formerly rule 32, provides guidance to the Secretary as to who is to receive notice on completion of the selection
of the members of a committee.

Rule 52, formerly rule 7, sets out the administrative support to be provided by the Secretary. The new rule removes
the requirement that the Secretary should make arrangements for simultaneous translation because such a service
is included in the term ``administrative support''. 

Rule 53, formerly rule 8, specifies that each Secretary shall maintain a file of all documents filed in each extraordinary
challenge, whether or not a document was filed in accordance with these rules, reflecting that the Secretaries do
not have any discretion to reject a document that is submitted for filing. The issue of whether a document is properly
filed is for the committee to determine. 

Rule 54, formerly rule 9, provides for the forwarding of documents from the responsible Secretary to the other Secretary.


Rule 55, which amends former rule 10, provides for the publication of documents. Under the new rule, both Secretaries
cause a document to be published. The provision in the former rule for forwarding a document from one Secretary to the
other has been removed because it is part of the Secretary's administrative practice. 

Rule 56, formerly rule 12, provides for the storage, wrapping, handling and access to documents filed with the Secretary,
which contain personal, privileged or proprietary information. The term ``storage'' has been expanded to include
storage, maintenance, handling and distribution of documents.

Rule 57, formerly subrule 13(3), provides for removal from the Secretary's office of documents filed in an extraordinary
challenge proceeding. 

Subrule 58(1), formerly part of subrule 13(1), provides for access to information in the file of an extraordinary
challenge proceeding that is not personal, privileged or proprietary. 

Subrule 58(3), formerly part of subrule 13(1), sets out the procedure for providing copies of information to persons
who have been given access to the information. 

Rule 59 amends former rules 20, 26 and 41 and sets out the responsibilities of the Secretary for the forwarding and service
of documents, orders and decisions. Subrules 59(1) and (2) provide for the forwarding and service of documents upon
the filing of a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee. 

Subrules 59(3) and (4) provide for the service of orders and decisions of a committee and of Notices of Completion of
Extraordinary Challenges. 

Rule 60, formerly rule 56, provides for publication of the final decisions and orders of a committee. 



Rule 61 



Rule 61, formerly rule 44, provides for the service of documents in cases where the time period fixed for filing a motion
by a panelist for an 

in camera

 hearing has expired. 



Rules 62 to 64 



Rules 62 to 64 set out procedures on orders and decisions of a committee.

<TEXT>
 

Rule 62, formerly rule 55, provides that all committee orders and decisions require a majority vote. 


 Rule 63, which amends former rule 57, provides for Notices of Motion requesting dismissal. 


 Subrule 63(1) provides that a committee may terminate an extraordinary challenge proceeding where a motion requesting
dismissal of the proceeding has been filed. 


 Subrule 63(2) has been amended to remove the requirement for an order of the committee where termination is by consent
of all participants. The subrule now provides that an extraordinary challenge proceeding is terminated when all
participants consent to dismissal and an affidavit to that effect is filed. 


 Rule 64, formerly rule 58, sets out three alternative actions which a committee may take on a final decision. The rule
has been amended to include the possibility of a remand in a proceeding based on a Request for Extraordinary Challenge
Committee filed under Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement. 


 

Rules 65 to 67 


 

Rules 65 to 67 provide for the completion of extraordinary challenge proceedings. 


 Rule 65 amends former rule 59 to provide that publication of a Notice of Termination on termination of an extraordinary
challenge proceeding by consent occurs on the day after the day on which all requirements under subrule 63(2) are met,
given that termination on consent no longer requires issuance of an order by the committee. 


 Rule 66, formerly rule 60, provides for publication of a Notice of Completion of Extraordinary Challenge on issuance
of a final decision by a committee. 


 Subrule 60(c) has been amended to provide that on remand to a panel, it is the Secretary, not the panel as in the former
rule, who gives notice to the committee that the panel has taken action not inconsistent with the decision of the committee.



 Rule 67, formerly rule 61, provides for discharge of committee members.
