AGENCIES: 

Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.


 

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this final rule is to codify determinations made by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) with respect
to the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco. In accordance with the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (1938 Act), as amended,
the Secretary determined the 1994 marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco to be 802.6 million pounds. In accordance
with the Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the 1994 price support level to
be 158.3 cents per pound.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
Based on information compiled by USDA, it has been determined that this final rule: 

(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 

(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 

(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 



Final Regulatory Impact Analysis 



A final regulatory impact analysis describing the impact of the established quota and support level is available
on request from Robert L. Tarczy.

Federal Assistance Program 



The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule since neither ASCS
nor the Commodity Credit Corporation is required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of
proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of this rule. 



Executive Order 12372 



This activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The amendments to 7 CFR parts 723 and 1464 set forth in this final rule do not contain any new or revised information collection
requirements that require clearance through the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C.
chapter 35. 



Statutory Background 



This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act. Section 1108(c) of Public Law 99-272
provides that the determinations made in this rule are not subject to the provisions for public participation in rule
making contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary. 

On December 15, 1993, the Secretary announced the national marketing quota and price support level for the 1994 crop
of flue-cured tobacco. 



Marketing Quota 



Section 317(a)(1)(b) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketing quota for a marketing year for
flue-cured tobacco is the quantity of such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total
of: 
(1) The amount of flue-cured tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase
on U.S. auction markets or from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the three
marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity,
if any, that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve
stock level. 

Section 317(a)(1)(c) further provides that, with respect to the 1990 through 1994 marketing years, any reduction
in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceed 10 percent of the previous year's national marketing
quota. The reserve stock level is defined in section 301(b)(14)(C) of the 1938 Act as the greater of 100 million pounds
or 15 percent of the national marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco for the marketing year immediately preceding
the marketing year for which the level is being determined. 

Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S.
cigarette production and sales shall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the 1994 crop
of flue-cured tobacco by December 1, 1993. Six such manufacturers were required to submit such a statement for the
1994 crop and the total of their intended purchases for the 1994 crop is 288.0 million pounds. The three-year average
of exports is 391.3 million pounds. 

The national marketing quota for the 1993 crop year was 891.8 million pounds (58 FR 11960). Thus, in accordance with
section 301 (b)(14)(C), the reserve stock level for use in determining the 1994 marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco
is 133.8 million pounds. 

As of December 6, 1993, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corporation had in its inventory 316.8 million pounds
of flue-cured tobacco (excluding pre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred
sales). Accordingly, the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is a decrease of 183.0 million
pounds. 

The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1994-95 marketing year is 496.3 million pounds. However,
the 1994 national marketing quota cannot be less than 90 percent of 1993's quota. Accordingly, the national marketing
quota for the marketing year beginning July 1, 1994, for flue-cured tobacco is 802.6 million pounds. 

Section 317(a)(2) of the 1938 Act provides that the national average yield goal be set at a level that the Secretary
determines will improve or ensure the useability of the tobacco and increase the net return per pound to the growers.
Yields in crop year 1993 did not change significantly from the previous year. Accordingly, the national average yield
goal for the 1994-95 marketing year will be 2,088 pounds per acre, the same as last year's level. 

In accordance with section 317(a)(3) of the 1938 Act, the national acreage allotment for the 1994 crop of flue-cured
tobacco is determined to be 384,386.97 acres, derived from dividing the national marketing quota by the national
average yield goal. 

In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from
the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 3 percent of the national acreage allotment
for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing
allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco
of 744 acres is adequate for these purposes.

In accordance with section 317(a)(4) of the 1938 Act, the national acreage factor for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco
for uniformly adjusting the acreage allotment of each farm is determined to be 0.90, which is the result of dividing
the 1994 national allotment (384,386.97 acres) minus the national reserve (744 acres) 
by the total of allotments established for flue-cured tobacco farms in 1993 
(426,268.80 acres). 

In accordance with section 317(a)(7) of the 1938 Act, the national yield factor for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco
is determined to be 0.9255, which is the result of dividing the national average yield goal (2,088 pounds) by a weighted
national average yield (2,256 pounds). 



Price Support 



Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for
which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers, at a level determined in accordance with a formula
prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act. 

With respect to the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco, the level of support is determined in accordance with sections
106 (d) and (f) of the 1949 Act. Section 106(f)(7)(A) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support for the 1994 crop
of flue-cured tobacco shall be: 

(1) The level, in cents per pound, at which the 1993 crop of flue-cured tobacco was supported, plus or minus, respectively,


(2) An adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after
taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of: 

(A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which: 

(I) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination
is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was
the lowest in such period, is greater or less than: 

(II) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year
for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year
in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and 

(B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by the tobacco producers
from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.


The difference between the two 5-year averages (i.e., the difference between (A) (I) and (II)) is 0.5 cents per pound.
The difference in the cost index from January 1 to December 31, 1993, is 1.6 cents per pound. Applying these components
to the price support formula (0.5 cents per pound, two-thirds weight; 1.6 cents per pound, one-third weight) results
in a weighted total of 0.9 cents per pound. As indicated, section 106 provides that the Secretary may, on the basis of
supply and demand conditions, limit the change in the price support level to no less than 65 percent of that amount.
In order to remain competitive in foreign and domestic markets, the Secretary used his discretion to limit the increase
to 65 percent of the maximum allowable increase. Accordingly, the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco will be supported
at 158.3 cents per pound, 0.6 cents higher than in 1993.

Celery Grown in Florida; Decreased Expenses and Assessment Rate 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an amended
interim final rule that decreased the level of authorized expenses and reduced the assessment rate that generates
funds to pay those expenses. Authorization of this budget enables the Florida Celery Committee (Committee) to incur
expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived
from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 149 and Order No. 967, both as amended (7 CFR part 967), regulating
the handling of celery grown in Florida. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Florida celery is subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will
be applicable to all assessable celery handled during the 1993-94 fiscal year, from August 1, 1993, through
July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately seven producers of Florida celery under this marketing order, and approximately seven handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Florida celery producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

The budget of expenses for the 1993-94 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for
local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee
are producers and handlers of Florida celery. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods
and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated
and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and
provide input. 
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Florida celery. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
The Committee met June 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993-94 budget of $90,000 and an assessment rate
of $0.02 per crate. The expenses and assessment rate were published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38277). That interim final rule added  967.228, authorizing expenses
and establishing an assessment rate for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments
through August 16, 1993. No comments were filed.

The Committee budgeted $45,000 to the American Celery Council for promotional and merchandising activities. However,
the Council is no longer in business. The Committee subsequently met on October 6, 1993, and unanimously recommended
a decrease of $45,000 for promotion, merchandising, and public relations; reducing funding for the category to $15,000.
This action reduces the total Committee budget for fiscal year 1993-94 to $45,000. 

The Committee also unanimously recommended reducing the assessment rate by $0.01, for a total of $0.01. This rate,
when applied to anticipated shipments of 4,500,000 crates, will yield $45,000 in assessment income. Funds in the
Committee's authorized reserve as of July 31, 1992, were $27,853, which is within the maximum permitted by the order
of one marketing year's expenses. 

An amended interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62033). That interim final rule amended  967.228 to decrease the level of authorized
expenses and reduce the assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file
comments through December 27, 1993. No comments were received. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1993-94 fiscal year began on August 1, 1993. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal period apply to all assessable celery handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware
of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an amended interim final rule.

Milk in the Georgia Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension of rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document suspends for the months of July and August 1994 provisions of the Georgia Federal milk marketing order
that provide for payments to producers on the basis of a base and excess payment plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 


Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued December 7, 1993; published December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65135). 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action
will encourage milk production during the months of July and August, which are months of declining milk production.


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. This rule does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry
of the ruling. 

This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the
rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part
900). 

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65135), concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested
persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, and arguments thereon. Three comment letters were
received in response to the proposed suspension. 

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that for the months of July and August 1994 the following
provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act: 

1. In  1007.32, paragraph (a). 
2. In  1007.61(a), the words ``of September through January''. 
3. In  1007.61, paragraph (b).

Statement of Consideration 


This suspension removes the requirement that producers be paid on the basis of the base and excess plan for the months
of July and August 1994. The proposal was submitted by Carolina/Virginia Milk Producers Association, Inc., Dairymen,
Inc., and Southern Milk Sales, Inc. These cooperative associations have a substantial amount of milk pooled on the
Georgia milk market. In support of their proposal, the cooperative associations state that the suspension is needed
because in recent years milk in this area has been in short supply during July and August. Without the suspension, the
cooperatives contend the market's base and excess plan would discourage production in those months. They further
state that it is necessary to take this action well before the proposed suspension takes effect to address the desire
of individual dairy farmers to have knowledge of the base payment period prior to any base purchases. 
Several producers in Georgia filed comments in opposition to the proposed suspension. The producers state that the
proposed suspension would force them to be paid on the blend price which would reduce the price they receive for their
milk. 
Under the order's base and excess plan, producers establish ``base'' on the basis of their production during the months
of September through January and are paid on the basis of their ``base'' and ``excess'' milk during the following months
of February through August. The plan was suspended during August 1993, the most recent base-paying month. 
With the suspension of the base and excess payment plan in July and August, producers would be paid a blend price for
all of their milk during those months. In July 1993, the last month the base and excess payment plan was operative, there
was a 24-cent difference between the blend price and the base price. The difference between the blend price and the
excess price however, was $3.96. Thus, while it is true that, without the plan, producers would receive somewhat less
for their base milk, this difference is far less than the $3.96 difference between the blend price and the excess price,
which is a major impediment to keeping milk that is in excess of base milk on the market. It is also a major obstacle to
fluid milk handlers in attracting supplemental milk supplies on a direct-shipped basis from producers in nearby
markets. Under the plan, such producers would be only entitled to the excess price for all of their milk shipped to the
market because they had not earned base in the Georgia market. 
During the past two years, the Class I utilization of producer milk tightened markedly during the months of July and
August. For example, the Class I utilization in 1992 increased from 74.9 percent in June to 75.5 percent in July and
to 79.7 percent in August. In 1993, the Class I utilization similarly increased from 77.6 percent in June to 89.7 percent
in July and to 84.4 percent in August. These figures indicate that the market is extremely tight during the months of
July and August and that there is merit to the request to remove any disincentive producers may have to increasing production
or shipping supplemental milk to the market. 
The suspension will increase the amount of milk available for fluid use in the Georgia market. It will allow fluid milk
handlers to attract supplemental milk supplies from producers in nearby markets. Additionally, producers with
excess milk will not be encouraged to shift off the market in July and August and thereby detract from the basic function
of the order in assuring an adequate supply of milk. 
The benefits of having an adequate supply of milk available to meet fluid needs outweigh the benefits which would accrue
to producers who would receive higher prices. Accordingly, the proposal to suspend the base and excess payment plan
during July and August 1994 is adopted.

Cost Containment and Vulnerability 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farmers Home Administration, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulations regarding the processing of preapplications for
Rural Rental Housing (RRH) assistance. This action is necessary to decrease costs associated with the program and
to reduce program vulnerability. The intended effect is to improve credit quality and to make our regulations more
responsive to the prudent development of RRH complexes in rural America. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Classification 



We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: 

(1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 

(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; 

(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 
(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Environmental Impact Statement 



This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, Subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the
determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1949, Public Law 91-90,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 



Intergovernmental Consultation 



For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFR part 2015, subpart V, programs 10.415 Rural Rental
Housing Loans and 10.427_Rural Rental Assistance Payments are subject to Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 0575-0042
and 0575-0033 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The information collection
contained in 0575-0047 will not become effective until approved by OMB. Please send written comments to the
Office of Information Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Washington, DC 20503. Please send
a copy of your comments to Jack Holston, Agency Clearance Officer, USDA, FmHA, AG Box 0743, Washington, DC 20250. 



Programs Affected 



These programs/activities are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under Numbers 10.415, Rural
Rental Housing Loans and 10.427, Rural Rental Assistance Payments. 



Background 



During its audits of FmHA's identity of interest construction cost certification process, the Office of Inspector
General found many instances where borrowers were taking advantage of loopholes in FmHA regulations. This resulted
in the loss of Government funds through excess profit being paid to paper contractors, failure of the borrowers to
reveal identities of interest with related parties, failure on the part of CPA's to adequately perform cost certifications,
and numerous other discrepancies of varying severity, all of which have had detrimental effects on the program. OIG
reviewed the proposed changes to the regulations and voiced its support for the proposed changes as a mean for reducing
fraud, waste, and abuse in the 515 program. 



Discussion of Comments 



The proposed rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 27379-27394) on June 19, 1992, provided for a 60-day comment period ending August 18, 1992. One hundred
and twenty-one comments were received during the comment period from the public and from FmHA field employees. 



Comments 



Implementation Proposal 



FmHA has stated that all preapplications and applications on hand will be subject to the final rule with the exception
of applications whose plans and specifications have been finalized. 

Several persons agreed that preapplications and applications not be ``grandfathered'' except for those which have
received an AD-622 and which are within the District's 150 percent loan approval authority. Other persons objected
to not ``grandfathering'' because of the expense already incurred in developing an application. 

Since applicants have already invested substantial sums of money in the development of building plans, FmHA has reconsidered
this position. Building plans included with preapplications which have been issued an AD-622 inviting a formal
application will not be affected; all other material associated with preapplications will be subject to the provisions
of the final rule. 



FmHA Instruction 1924-A 



1. Section 1924.10 (c)(2)(i) 





Comment:

 Comments were received concerning the requirement that all transfers of funds between line items would require the
approval of the servicing official using Form FmHA 1924-7. The general feeling is that estimates are merely
estimates and will fluctuate during the construction period. To require the servicing official to approve change
orders for every line item change would cause a major paperwork burden on both the contractor and FmHA. 



FmHA response:

 The Agency recognizes the volume of paperwork and delay involved with this requirement. FmHA will, instead, implement
a means to flag significant variances in line item costs. Increases or decreases at or above a 15 percent threshold
will require documentation from the borrower to justify the differences. The State Director will also have the authority
to require documentary justification for less than 15 percent variances if he/she deems it necessary. The documentation
will be required at the time the project is cost certified so that construction will not be delayed. 



2. Section 1924.13(a)(3) 





Comment:

 Most persons agreed that architectural fees should be reduced when less than full architectural services are provided.
It was suggested that it would be appropriate to establish a range of fees covering a range of similar services. It was
also pointed out that an acceptable design in one place can involve a redraw in others due to local code interpretations.




FmHA response:

 The intent of this requirement is for those instances where the applicant uses a set of plans that has previously been
used. Even if a new site requires some modification to adapt the building to the site, it will not require a complete
redraw of the building. While there can be no hard and fast rules set by Washington as to the degree of revision needed
to qualify the architect for full services, this can be determined at the State level. Compensation is expected to
reasonably represent the value of the architect's services to the owner.

3. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(iii)(B)(

3

) and 1924.13(e)(2)(i)(D) 





Comment:

 A number of persons suggested that more training be provided to FmHA field staff in analyzing the financial statement
to determine whether there is sufficient ``financial strength to carry out all phases of construction.'' Another
suggestion was that FmHA require a performance and payment bond from all contractors, in which case the credit worthiness
will have been determined by a surety company. Several persons pointed out the fact that credit reports do not reflect
the financial strength of the contractor. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA has completed phase one of a two phase training program in the proper analysis of financial reports. The training
is being conducted by an outside accounting firm and involves State, District, and National Office personnel. We
recognize that requiring a payment and performance bond from all contractors would probably eliminate the small
yet qualified contractor from participating in the 515 program. Based on the comments that a credit report is not the
vehicle through which financial strength can be determined, FmHA will require that each contractor provide a financial
statement of its operations. The financial statement will be analyzed to determine if the contractor has the financial
strength to pay construction bills prior to obtaining draws from the lender. Language relating to the submission
of a financial statement has been added to this section. A credit report will still be required from all contractors.



4. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(iv) and 1924.13(e)(2)(i)(G) 





Comment:

 There was some opposition to eliminating the price of cost certifications from the contract. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA deleted this cost from this section because it intended to contract for cost certifications itself. This would
have eliminated the need for including the cost in the construction contract since they would be paid from Agency funds.
It has now been determined that the Agency will be unable to contract for all cost certifications, so the previous language
pertaining to cost certification expenses has been restored to this section to cover those situations where the borrower
will be required by FmHA to obtain the certification. 


5. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v) and 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(E) 





Comment:

 Several persons agreed with the proposal that FmHA contract directly for cost certifications. The most consistently
expressed concern was about the delay in the Government contracting process, resulting in increased interim interest
expense. There was also some concern about the burden this proposal would place on FmHA. There was a suggestion to have
FmHA contract with a CPA to review and/or audit a certain percentage of the cost certifications within the State each
year. Also, one person suggested that FmHA allow contracts between the CPA and the contractor when the CPA can certify
that he/she has no other relationship with the contractor except for the cost certification. Comments from other
persons stated that the ongoing working relationship between the borrower and the CPA is a definite advantage since
the CPA is familiar with the accounting system and procedures of the borrower. They felt that having full-time access
to the CPA who is responsible for monitoring the construction cost recording process would allow for timely maintenance
of records. An FmHA-contracted auditor would not have this familiarity with the borrower's books. One respondent
suggested that FmHA publish a guide to tell CPA's how FmHA wants the cost certifications performed and reported. One
suggestion is that instead of contracting for cost certifications directly, FmHA should strengthen its ability
to debar an incompetent CPA. Another respondent suggested that FmHA establish a list of CPA's who have been designated
as acceptable for cost certification. One suggestion was that FmHA make a judgment of whether the borrower's cost
certification is satisfactory instead of hiring the CPA directly. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA has worked with the Office of Inspector General to develop an audit program which CPA's will follow in performing
cost certification audits. During recent OIG audits of cost certifications prepared on FmHA-financed rental housing
projects, it was discovered that many CPA's were not maintaining the independence required by generally accepted
auditing standards. It is obvious from some of the comments that some CPA's who are cost certifying construction costs
have also been involved in the maintenance of the borrowers' construction records. FmHA will not have sufficient
contracting funds to cover the cost of all certifications; therefore, it anticipates contracting for all certifications
on loans of $1.5 million and over and a random sampling of all other loans. Details will have to be worked out in the contracting
process to prevent undue delay in closing loans. In the event FmHA does contract for a cost certification, the borrower
will not be responsible for providing a certification since that would duplicate energies and expenses. Any funds
earmarked in the loan for cost certification but which are not needed because of an FmHA-contracted certification
will be returned on the loan and may not be used for any other purpose. 



6. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(A) 





Comment:

 There was some confusion about whether FmHA would be contracting with the CPA who examines the borrower's accounting
system or just with the CPA who performs the cost certification. A suggestion was offered that the borrower provide
a written assertion that it has an accounting system which complies with the regulations. The cost certification
CPA would then report on the validity of the assertion.

<PARENT> FR940214-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



FmHA response:

 It was the intent of this proposal that the borrower's CPA be responsible for verifying that the borrower's accounting
system meets the requirements of the regulation so that this responsibility can be removed from FmHA field personnel.
Since the Agency does not have accountants on staff, we do not feel we have the expertise to adequately check the borrower's
accounting system. We agree with the suggestion that the borrower be allowed to provide a written assertion on the
accounting system and that the cost certification CPA report on its validity. This section has been rewritten to incorporate
that suggestion. 


7. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(B), 1924.13(e)(2)(iv), and 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(B) 





Comment:

 There was a question as to whether FmHA intends to reduce builder's profit when costs of line item are increased. Another
respondent wondered if it is the intent of FmHA to restrict the amount of each line item to the estimated amount. Several
persons objected to the restriction of general requirements to the estimated amount. One respondent recommended
that any cost savings from project construction be returned on the loan and that the loan be reamortized to reflect
a decrease in tenant rent. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA intends that builder's profit be reduced when the total costs of the line item costs exceed their estimates and
would result in an increase in the contract amount. The amounts for general overhead, profit, and general requirements
will be restricted to their estimated amounts, not the line items to their estimated amounts. FmHA believes that the
estimates for general requirements can be accurately determined prior to the start of construction and not deviate
significantly thereafter. We do not feel this would result in an undue burden on the borrower. A refund of loan funds
can be used to reamortize the loan if it can be shown that the amount refunded will reduce the rents and an exception to
the 10 percent requirement has been granted by the National Office. 


8. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(C) and 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(A) 





Comment:

 There was some objection to requiring the borrower to agree that the tests conducted will include FmHA audit requirements.
One respondent has recommended that the language be changed to refer to FmHA 1924-A instead of ``FmHA regulations''
and has provided FmHA with suggested language for this section. 



FmHA response:

 Because of the problems with how cost certifications are conducted, as revealed by OIG, FmHA felt it necessary to institute
additional instructions to the CPA/LPA's which are intended to provide uniformity in the examination of construction
costs. FmHA sought advice and assistance from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in developing
the additional instructions referred to as the Audit Program. The Audit Program will be available in FmHA offices.
It is FmHA's intent that the borrower recognize the Audit Program and to ensure that the auditor include its requirements
in the cost certification process. The language of this section has been reworded as recommended by AICPA. FmHA has
changed the reference from FmHA regulations to FmHA Instruction 1924-A. 


9. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(D) 





Comment:

 One respondent objects to the auditor having to certify that he/she has no financial interest in or with the applicant/owner-builder,
architect, engineer, attorney, contractor, etc., since Government Auditing Standards prohibit such an identity
of interest. Two respondents pointed out an inconsistency in the suggested CPA opinion letter since one paragraph
refers to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and another refers to General Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). 



FmHA response:

 Even though the Government Auditing Standards prohibits identities of interest between CPA's and the applicant,
architect, engineer, attorney, contractor, etc., OIG audits have revealed apparent close relationships exist
between some CPA's and borrowers. Certain CPA's have not maintained an independence from the borrower as required
by Government Auditing Standards. There is no inconsistency in the suggested opinion letter since GAGAS pertains
to the audit of the construction costs and GAAP pertains to the accounting system which the borrower uses in recording
construction costs. OIG has submitted a sample auditor's report which is incorporated in the Audit Program and available
in any FmHA office. 


10. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(F) 





Comment:

 The opinion was expressed that the CPA who reviews the borrower's accounting system be allowed to cost certify. Also,
costs will be duplicated if the borrower has to hire a CPA in addition to FmHA contracting for CPA services. There was
objection to denying the right of a CPA to cost certify when that CPA is currently handling the contractor's accounting.




FmHA response:

 It was originally FmHA's intent that the CPA who reviews the borrower's accounting system not cost certify the project
after construction. This was primarily due to the fact that OIG audit findings revealed a lack of independence between
CPA's and borrowers. We have reconsidered this prohibition and will allow the same CPA who sets up or examines the borrowers
accounting system to certify construction costs. However, the CPA who provides any accounting services to the borrower
during construction will not be allowed to cost certify the project. To do so would be a violation of rules of independence
set forth in Government Auditing Standards.

11. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(G) 





Comment:

 There was one objection to using the new forms since the respondent felt FmHA already has an identity of interest statement
in use. 



FmHA response:

 The purpose of the new forms is twofold; one to require all borrowers to disclose all identities of interest and the
other to identify ``paper companies.'' The identity of interest statement itself has been changed to also include
other related parties. The forms also provide notification to all affected parties of the penalty for falsifying
the documents. FmHA feels these forms are needed. 



12. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(H) 





Comment:

 One respondent objected to having to report a discount or rebate when the original line item costs were based on the
discounted amount. Another person offered the rationale that rebates and discounts are incentives to buy ``right''
and to pay bills on time and that FmHA is attempting to remove these incentives. One respondent requested clarification
of the next to last sentence in this section. The general objection was voiced about reducing profit to agree with the
reduction in line item costs of construction. One person felt that contractors would use the pretext of obtaining
a rebate or discount in order to not contribute additional funds to cover the increase in line item costs. One respondent
supported this section. 



FmHA response:

 After due consideration, FmHA has decided that this section more appropriately pertains to multiple advance loans
where payments are made by FmHA and the amount of any discounts or rebates will be deducted before invoices are paid.
If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds will be returned to the supervised bank account.
Therefore, this section has been amended to delete reference to discounts and rebates. 



13. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(I) 





Comment:

 The reference to the HUD regulatory language apparently has caused some confusion since it was merely referenced.
One respondent wanted to know if the general contractor has to hammer nails in order to be performing work. Another
respondent felt that subcontracting out all or nearly all of the work is a typical and accepted practice. One respondent
suggested that this provision be waived if it can be demonstrated that it is to the benefit of the property. One person
questioned whether this provision will pertain to everyone or just in those cases where an identity of interest exists;
if it pertains to everyone, then this section should be taken from the cost certification portion of the regulation.
One respondent requested that we provide a definition of ``actual construction.'' Two respondents requested that
a distinction be made between work on new construction and work on a rehabilitation. One respondent agreed with this
section. 



FmHA response:

 To eliminate confusion, the reference to the HUD regulation has been removed from this section. OIG audits have found
repeatedly that persons who identified themselves as the construction contractor were not qualified to build the
project or, for some reason, did not build the project. They, instead, subcontracted out all or most of the construction
and still took a full builder's profit. FmHA adamantly opposes the payment of profit to anyone who does not perform
the full range of duties of a general contractor. This section does not prohibit a contractor from subcontracting
out any or all of the work as long as that contractor does not receive a builder's profit. The Agency has no objection
to the contractor being paid for services rendered. FmHA does not foresee any situation where waiver of this provision
will benefit the property. This section pertains only to identity of interest borrowers and will remain in this location.
For purposes of clarification, we are defining ``actual construction'' to mean ``work'' as defined in A.I.A. documents:
``* * * labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's
obligations.'' Irrespective of whether the project is new construction or rehabilitation, the general contractor
should not expect to receive a builder's profit if he/she has not performed the full ranges of responsibilities of
a general contractor.

14. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(v)(J) 





Comment:

 There was agreement that FmHA implement these new forms. One respondent suggested that more specific requirements
be added such as years in business, work performed other than on FmHA-financed. 



FmHA response:

 The new Form FmHA 1944-31 will require the entity to disclose number of years in business. We do not feel that identification
of the work performed on other than FmHA-financed projects is necessary since the entity is certifying that it is an
on-going business. 



15. Section 1924.13(e)(1)(vii)(B)(

1

) and 1924.13(e)(2)(iii)(A) 





Comment:

 One respondent expressed an opinion that this section will eliminate the smaller developers. There was some feeling
that this would discourage the participation of owner-builders or that it will cause undue delay in the processing
of the preapplication. One respondent recommended that the determination of whether to grant an exception to competitive
bidding be made at the application stage rather than at the preapplication stage. One respondent misinterpreted
this section to mean competitive bids would be granted rather than the negotiated contracts. 



FmHA response:

 The only new language added to this section requires that FmHA document, in writing, the examination required prior
to the State Director granting an exception to competitive bidding. We do not feel that small developers are any more
at risk now than before the change since the requirement is not new to this revision. FmHA agrees that the determination
of whether to grant an exception to competitive bidding be made during the application stage and have changed the language
to reflect this requirement. The correct meaning of this section is that negotiated contracts may be allowed once
the State Director has determined all requirements for granting an exception to competitive bidding have been met.




16. Section 1924.13(e)(2)(i)(G) 





Comment:

 One respondent wanted to know under what circumstances will cost estimation services be required and asked where
else in the regulation this subject is discussed. Another respondent raised issues which appear to be unrelated to
this section and we could not determine to which section the comment referred. Other comments pertain to the deletion
of cost certification fees which was previously discussed under  1924.13(e)(1)(iv). 



FmHA response:

 The existing regulation contained a provision for cost estimation services to be used if FmHA did not agree with the
owner-builder's estimate. This was seldom, if ever, imposed. Our recent test of using estimating services proved
to be unreliable and inconsistent. The reference to cost estimation has been removed from the regulation. 



17. Section 1924.13(e)(2)(iv) 





Comment:

 One respondent suggested that allowances for general overhead, general requirements, and a builder's profit be
based on a regional cost rather than on a State average. 



FmHA response:

 This section states that the amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data for the area. It
does not mention a State average. 



18. This Respondent Refers to 1924.13(e)(1)(vii)(D)



There is no such section in FmHA Instruction 1924-A. 



19. Section 1924.13(e)(2)(viii) 





Comment:

 One respondent asked if the requirement that projects have their costs ``audited by FmHA'' refers to cost certification
contracted by FmHA, OIG or other FmHA audit. Another respondent points out that this section contains a cost certification
cutoff for projects of $350,000 or more and expresses an opinion that there should be no difference between identity
of interest and owner-builder. One respondent points out that a FmHA 1924-13 is mandatory for all loans of over
$350,000 and that if the loan is publicly bid this form should not be mandatory. 



FmHA response:

 The reference to ``audited by FmHA'' falls within the same provision that was discussed earlier concerning FmHA contracting
for all cost certifications. The respondent is correct in his observation concerning the $350,000 cutoff for owner-builders.
All owner-builders are identity of interest entities which automatically require a cost certification. The reference
to $350,000 has been removed from this section. FmHA regulation 1944-E now requires that all applicants submit
Form FmHA 1924-13 to facilitate the tracking of line item costs in the Agency's upcoming computerized cost tracking
system. This applies to all applicants regardless of whether or not an identity of interest is involved. 



20. Section 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(B) 





Comment:

 One respondent suggested that further clarification be added to the section regarding amounts for general overhead,
general requirements, and builder's profit as being treated as individual and separate line items amounts or whether
all three should be combined, thus eliminating the need for Administrative Notice explanation. Another comment
did not appear to pertain to this section.

FmHA response:

 The Administrative Notice issued on this subject addressed the percentages for establishing separate amounts for
general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit; this section refers to the dollar amounts which are
established as a result of the percentage calculation. The FmHA 1924-13 requires that these three items be listed
separately. This section refers to establishing dollar amounts for general overhead, general requirements, and
builder's profit and that actual costs for those three items will not exceed their dollar estimates. Language addressing
the allowable percentages for general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit has been added to  1944.215(a)(1)
of subpart E of part 1944. 



21. Section 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(C) 



There was one comment and the respondent expressed agreement with this section. 



22. Section 1924.13(e)(2)(viii)(D) 





Comment:

 One respondent expressed agreement with this section. Another respondent requested clarification of the reference
to HUD regulation. 



FmHA response:

 The reference to the HUD regulations has been dropped from this section as discussed under  1924.13(e)(1)(v)(I),
above. 



1944-E 



1. Section 1944.211(a)(3) 





Comment:

 A number of objections were expressed to limiting the number of preapplications to five. Several respondents supported
this proposal. The reasons were many and too numerous to list. One respondent suggested that the limitation be based
on applications and not preapplications and that the number be controlled on a State basis. Many persons suggested
that the number of preapplications be based on the financial capacity of the applicant and not on the number of preapplications.
Other recommendations include a limit of from 3 to 15 preapplications; 5 preapplications and a nationwide limit of
10; 10 preapplications per District; 15 or 20 with no more than 5 funded and/or under construction at one time; and 10
preapplications nationwide except for preapplications accompanied by a deposit equal to 1 percent of the loan. Other
respondents recommended no limit be set for preapplications or applications. Several persons recommended returning
preapplications which cannot be funded within a set period of months. 

To illustrate his objection to limiting the number of preapplications, one respondent sent several photographs
of FmHA-financed apartment complexes which were not being properly managed. The respondent alleged that these apartments
were owned by small developers and the photographs serve as an example of what would happen to the section 515 program
if only small developers could participate. 



FmHA response:

 The majority of comments were overwhelmingly opposed to restricting the number of preapplications. Therefore,
the Agency is not undertaking any changes to this section at this time. 

FmHA was concerned over the photographs and investigated the respondent's claim. In all cases, FmHA was taking action
to correct the management deficiencies. In almost all cases, the developers of the subject apartments were not small
developers. In the one case where the developer would be considered a small developer, the State did not feel the management
problems were due to the fact the developer was not a large entity. Therefore, we do not consider this particular objection
to the proposed rule to have merit. 



2. Section 1944.211(a)(5) 





Comment:

 One respondent expressed an opinion that requiring evidence that the borrower has or can obtain the 3 percent borrower
contribution at the preapplication stage is premature and should not be required until prior to obligation.

FmHA response:

 The ability of the borrower to furnish the contribution is a criterion of eligibility. The Agency feels that eligibility
must be established at preapplication stage. If that requirement were to be delayed until the loan is ready to be obligated,
the applicant and FmHA would have invested far too much time and money to have the applicant determined not eligible.
The 3 percent contribution was increased to 5 percent by the Community Development Act of 1992 for all projects whose
members will receive benefits from Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The regulation has already been changed to reflect
the increase in the equity contribution requirement. 



3. Section 1944.211 (a)(5) 





Comment:

 Two respondents expressed the opinion that applicants should be required to furnish the 3 percent borrower contribution
from its own resources. 



FmHA response:

 Currently, borrowers have no personal financial obligation to serve as an impetus to seeing that the project operates
successfully. We agree that such an obligation will encourage continued interest in overseeing the well-being of
the project and it makes sense from a business standpoint. Therefore, FmHA agrees that applicants should furnish
the 3 or 5 percent contribution from their own resources and have changed this section to reflect that requirement.




4. Section 1944.211(a)(7)(i) 





Comment:

 Several comments were received concerning the requirement that the applicant provide sufficient cash to cover start-up
costs and that a list of such materials and equipment be provided. It was felt that this was an attempt to disallow the
use of letters of credit to cover the O&M expenses. 



FmHA response:

 Currently, regulations allow borrowers to provide a letter of credit to cover the total amount needed for operating
and maintenance expenses. FmHA has experienced a reluctance on the part of borrowers to draw on the letters of credit
since doing so will incur interest expenses for which they are liable. Thus, there have been many instances where there
were insufficient funds to cover needed start-up costs. Requiring the borrower to provide the requirement in cash
will ensure the availability of adequate funds with which to cover these expenses. The Housing Act of 1949, as amended,
states that ``The Secretary may require that the initial operating reserve under this section may be in the form of
an irrevocable letter of credit * * *''. This language provides the Agency the option of whether to
require letters of credit or to require the initial O&M in cash. FmHA has determined that more benefits will be
derived by projects if cash is furnished for the operating reserves and, for this reason, has decided not to accept
letters of credit.

5. Section 1944.212(b) 





Comment:

 A number of comments were received concerning restricting rehabilitation loans to no more than 5 percent of the loan
for new construction. Several of the respondents expressed their support for placing this limit on rehabilitation
loans. Also, a couple of respondents suggested that FmHA eliminate purchase and rehabilitation of historic buildings
altogether. Several respondents did not favor this proposal and misconstrued its intent as an attempt to eliminate
rehabilitation of historic buildings. 



FmHA response:

 The cost for purchasing and rehabilitating existing buildings has increased noticeably within the recent past and
has, in some cases, exceeded the amount needed for constructing new units. FmHA feels it appropriate to establish
a ceiling to ensure maximum use of loan funds. The excess cost of rehabilitation would be better spent to finance more
units in other areas of need. Therefore, the Agency feels that a limit should be placed on the amount of Government funds
being expended for rehabilitating historic buildings. While the Agency does not wish to prohibit the purchase and
rehabilitation of historic buildings, it feels that a ceiling is needed to prevent unlimited funds from being used
for this purpose. The proposed regulation does not prohibit the borrower from infusing additional cash from its or
other sources in order to fully fund the purchase and rehabilitation. FmHA's first consideration must be to providing
rental units to its beneficiaries at the lowest cost to the tenants. 



6. Section 1944.212(c)(1) 





Comment:

 One respondent expressed an opinion that this section limits the basis of FmHA's maximum loan being 97 percent of total
development cost or appraised value. Another respondent stated it does not appear there is a specific provision to
accomplish what is required in this section. One respondent suggested adding clarification that FmHA can lend the
present market value of the site ``as improved'' and that the cost of the improvements could not be released until all
improvements were in place. One respondent recommended the section be revised to state the lower of the appraised
value or purchase price will be used to determine total development cost and the applicant's initial investment.
Another respondent recommended we restore the original language of this section. One respondent agreed that loan
funds used to purchase land may not exceed the estimated market value as established by an appraisal. 



FmHA response:

 The only changes made to this section are the reference to FmHA Instruction 1922-B and deletion of the words ``in
excess of estimated market value'' in the last sentence. These changes do not alter how the loan is calculated. The
purchase price of land is not the basis for establishing the applicant's initial investment. The FmHA loan is limited
to the development cost or the security value of the project, whichever is less; the applicant is responsible for the
equity contribution whether it is in the form of land, cash, or a combination of both. After considering the comments,
we feel that this section is confusing as written since it should be addressing the amount of loan funds which can be
used to purchase land and should not include discussion of how the purchase price affects the applicant's initial
investment. The last sentence has been removed. 



7. Section 1944.212(c)(2) 





Comment:

 One respondent suggested that the existing language be restored to this section. 



FmHA response:

 The first sentence of the existing paragraph was removed because it already exists under  1944.213(c)(10).




8. Section 1944.212(c)(3) 





Comment:

 One respondent voiced the opinion that the density requirements referred to in  1944.215(a)(5) are not definitive.
Another respondent suggested that FmHA define excess land. Another respondent felt that this section is in conflict
with  1944.215(a)(6) and should be deleted. One respondent agreed with the section as long as consideration
is given to local zoning requirements.

<PARENT> FR940214-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



FmHA response:

 FmHA feels that excess land is adequately defined in this section and in  1944.215(a)(6). We do not agree that
this section conflicts with  1944.215(a)(6). Section 1944.215(a)(6) states that local zoning ordinances
and, in extreme cases, the site size, shape, or condition will be the determining factors in arriving at site density.




9. Section 1944.212(d) 





Comment:

 There were a number of suggestions concerning the establishment of a range of costs for offsite facilities. One respondent
recommended that all offsite costs be eliminated from the loan. It was pointed out by several respondents that States
have not approved any off-site facility costs. It was also suggested that each situation is unique and should be judged
on its own merits and not be compared with past performance. One respondent felt this would place an undue burden on
FmHA and that establishing a range would not prove anything since the bottom line must be the actual ``as developed''
value of the site. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA agrees that every situation has to be judged on its own merit and that it would be impractical to try to establish
a range of costs for offsite facilities. The language has been changed to delete this requirement. 



10. Section 1944.212(g) 





Comment:

 There was generally an expression of agreement with the addition of blinds as an eligible loan purpose. One respondent,
however, suggested that we also include shades with this provision. One respondent wanted to know if individual washer/dryer
hookups could be interpreted to mean ``laundry facility.'' Another respondent voiced an opinion that washer/dryer
hookups in addition to a central laundry facility increases marketability of rental units. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA has no objection to including shades in this provision and has amended the language accordingly. Laundry facilities
are defined as the actual washers and dryers facilities available to all of the tenants and not just washer and dryer
hookups. Washers and dryers owned by individual tenants are not available to all tenants and cannot be considered
as ``laundry facilities.'' FmHA stands by its previous position regarding the prohibition of placing washers and
dryers in individual units when a central laundry facility is provided unless it is customary for the area for the size
of project and type of housing involved. Washer and dryer hookups are an additional expense to overall project costs
and, in the majority of cases, are not used by the tenants. Additionally, there have been problems with the hookups
leaking and causing water damage to the units. 



11. Section 1944.212(i) 





Comment:

 There were numerous objections to disallowing certain fees when the borrowing entity will receive low income housing
tax credits, primarily because the end result will be an increase in the borrower's contribution. Other respondents
felt that if certain items were required by FmHA, then those items should be funded. One respondent suggested that
FmHA automatically increase the equity requirement for low income housing tax credit projects to 5 percent rather
than to eliminate certain fees and charges. One respondent suggested that the intent be clarified to mean the legal
fees associated with closing the FmHA loan and not the interim lender loan. Another person suggested that all non-low
income housing tax credit projects receive an additional 10 points in the rating criteria. One respondent felt that
this provision would reduce loan costs and thereby maximize the State's funding allocation. 



FmHA response:

 The Community Development Act of 1992 increased the equity contribution to 5 percent for borrowers whose members
will receive benefits from Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The regulation has already been changed to reflect this
increase. The original language pertaining to related costs has been restored. Legal fees pertain to the costs associated
with the FmHA loan closing only; clarification has been added to the section. FmHA does not agree with the suggestion
to allow an additional 10 points for non-low income housing tax credit projects. The purpose of the priority points
is to direct funding to the areas of greatest need and the lack of tax credits is not an indication of need. 



12. Section 1944.212(j) 





Comment:

 There were several respondents who expressed opposition to allowing payment for assistance to nonprofit groups
because of the inequity in handling profit vs. nonprofit applicants. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA published this section to correct a typographical error in the original section; however, the Agency feels that
the payment for technical assistance is appropriate for nonprofits since they must rely on their own resources which,
in some cases, are slim or nonexistent. 



13. Section 1944.213(b)(1) 





Comment:

 One respondent understood this section to mean the nonprofit organization may provide the initial operating capital
and/or relocation costs incurred and suggested that the section be revised to include relocation costs in the loan.




FmHA response:

 This section states that the loan may provide for the development cost or the security value of each project, whichever
is less, plus the 2 percent O&M and/or the relocation costs. This provision allows for the inclusion of relocation
costs in the loan.

14. Section 1944.213(b)(2) 





Comment:

 While 3 respondents agreed with the proposed computation of the loan amounts, numerous others disagreed. Most felt
that the Agency was attempting to increase the borrower's equity contribution. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA has removed the examples from this section and, instead, will provide instructions to its staff in how loans should
be calculated in a new Exhibit A-12. The Exhibit provides administrative guidance only and is not being published
with this document. A copy is available in any FmHA office. 



15. Section 1944.213(c)(10) 





Comment:

 One respondent expressed an opinion that there should be an exception to this provision which allows the person who
has owned land for a period of at least 3 years to recover costs associated with the increase in value and betterment
of the site. Another respondent suggested the restriction be expanded to provide that there be no common interest
for at least 3 years and that the option be with the owner of public record; an exception could be made for subsequent
loans on adjacent property. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA does not agree with this suggestion. Regulations, except in the case of a broadly-based nonprofit organization,
prohibit the use of loan funds to purchase land from the applicant or a member of the applicant organization. In the
case of a nonprofit organization, the appraisal will determine the value which can be included in the loan. We think
the suggestion concerning common interest has merit and have changed this section to add a 3-year provision. 



16. Section 1944.213(c)(12) 





Comment:

 One respondent felt that this section is no longer needed in light of the provisions of  1944.211(a)(7) (i) and
(ii) which would require the applicant to put up in cash the amount necessary for the initial 2 percent O&M. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA agrees with this comment and the section has been deleted. 



17. Section 1944.213(d) 





Comment:

 A few respondents expressed their opinion that this provision would be burdensome and time-consuming. One respondent
pointed out that the expense of a market study is always incurred prior to the applicant's filing a preapplication.
Another respondent pointed out the language of this section does not allow for predevelopment loans from nonprofit
organizations as was originally intended. 



FmHA response:

 Since most borrowers are familiar with the process and are aware of what must be done during the preapplication and
application phase, obtaining written verification from FmHA should pose no undue delay. OIG strongly recommended
that FmHA be aware of the applicant's intention to incur debts before they are actually incurred to preclude the appearance
of giving blanket approval for all such expenses. We agree that the language does not allow for predevelopment loans
from nonprofit organizations and the language has been amended to correct this omission. We have also exempted market
studies from the prior written approval requirement since they must be completed prior to filing a preapplication.




18. Section 1944.213(e)(1) 





Comment:

 Several persons objected to this section because of the delay it would cause during the construction process. Some
suggested that FmHA require post-approval instead of pre-approval to avoid such delays. 



FmHA response:

 The Agency feels that obtaining pre-approval from the District Office will not sufficiently hamper the construction
process if the contractor and borrower react in a timely manner. The only two occurrences which will allow an increase
in per unit cost is design changes by FmHA or State or local jurisdictions or changes in financing approved by FmHA.
Neither of these events would be construed as an emergency.

19. Section 1944.215(a) 





Comment:

 Two respondents expressed agreement with this section. Another respondent voiced an opinion that to require more
expensive building materials and, even though maintenance costs will be less, is contradictory to cost containment
goals. 



FmHA response:

 The Agency has witnessed what happens when cheaper building materials are used to initially control costs. The results
have been high maintenance costs over the life of the materials and the ultimate replacement of the materials. While
construction costs may be lower using the cheaper building materials, these savings are more than overshadowed by
the high maintenance costs necessary to prolong the use of the materials. FmHA strongly advocates the use of low maintenance
and long life materials in its construction. 



20. Section 1944.215(a)(1) 





Comment:

 There were several comments expressed about the costs being ``locked in'' to either our cost tracking system or to
the Marshall & Swift estimates, thereby not allowing any inflation increases. It was also noted that projects
with abnormally high or low costs should not be entered into the system and that only newer (one year old) projects be
tracked. It was felt that the borrower should not be responsible for resolving differences between a proposed project's
costs and those costs in the FmHA tracking system or in the Marshall & Swift estimates. Another respondent suggested
that the tracking system allow for a comparison of bedroom sizes rather than project to project comparison. One respondent
felt that the tracking system should provide for a distinction between new construction and rehabilitation. 



FmHA response:

 The new cost tracking system will allow FmHA to track by line item the costs of construction. For instance, the final
estimated cost of concrete for a proposed project will be recorded in the system at the time the loan is obligated. Once
the project has been built and the costs are certified (identity of interest projects), the certified cost of concrete
will also be recorded in the system and will become the basis for establishing a benchmark on costs. This should take
into consideration the inflationary escalation of costs during the construction period. Thereafter, the line item
costs for each new proposal will be compared with the amounts recorded in the tracking system. Local FmHA offices will
allow for future inflationary increases just as they do now. Only the projects received and processed after the tracking
system comes on line will be entered. We intended that significant differences between an applicant's cost estimates
and the estimates of our established tracking costs or Marshall & Swift be resolved since FmHA will not arbitrarily
accept any estimates which appear out of line or unreasonable. We foresee the borrower's responsibility for resolving
the differences in cost as either providing justification for the differences or taking whatever action is required
to ensure the best estimates are being considered in the construction. This method of tracking construction costs
will make no distinction between numbers of bedrooms or new construction vs. rehabilitation; costs will be tracked
on a line item basis and not on a project basis. 



21. Section 1944.215(a)(2) 





Comment:

 A few respondents suggested that FmHA establish timeframes for District and State Offices to follow during preapplication
and application review processing. Another respondent suggested that the AD-622 cover only the authorization
to develop plans and specifications and that the balance of the application not be pursued until receipt of the plans
and specifications and after the appraisal is completed. It was felt that this would reduce the time between signing
of the construction documents and the start of construction. 



FmHA response:

 From periodic assessments made of the multi-family housing program by FmHA's National Office, it is apparent that
the field staff's time is being utilized to its fullest extent. The large volume of preapplications being filed has
placed a considerable burden on the field, particularly when those preapplications which will not continue to be
processed because of their rating must still receive some degree of attention. To place timeframes on the field for
each step of processing would be unrealistic since they would most likely be impossible for the staff to meet. We do
not agree that authorizing just the completion of plans and specifications would reduce the time between signing
of the construction contract and the actual start of construction, since there are many other items needed to complete
the application and these could not be addressed until we authorized the applicant to proceed to a full application.
The cost estimates should be updated at the time the construction contract is signed so that the most up-to-date estimates
are obtained prior to approving the loan. 



22. Section 1944.215(a)(3) 



Only one comment was received and the respondent agreed with this section. 



23. Section 1944.215(a)(4) 



Only one comment was received and the respondent agreed with this section. 



24. Section 1944.215(a)(5) 





Comment:

 There were numerous objections to establishing a set number of units per acre because of the size, shape, and condition
of sites.

FmHA response:

 FmHA feels that more diligent efforts could be expended by applicants in locating more viable sites. Sites which have
sections unsuitable for building should be avoided. However, if a situation exists where the only available site
is of a size, shape, or condition which makes a portion unsuitable for building and the only alternative is to not provide
units, then a request to the State Office for an exception to this density requirement may be considered. Such language
has been added to the section. 



25. Section 1944.215(a)(6) 





Comment:

 Several respondents expressed the opinion that hiring construction inspectors is unrealistic at a time when FmHA
staff is being reduced. They also pointed out that delay in obtaining timely construction inspections by FmHA has
been a problem and suggested including language in the regulation that would require necessary inspections within
a reasonable timeframe. 



FmHA response:

 The hiring of construction inspectors is a suggestion which may or may not be possible to follow. If not, it may be possible
for States to contract for these services. The comment about not having timely construction inspections by FmHA provides
an appropriate case-in-point for adequate inspection coverages. This subject will be discussed at future training
meetings with the field staff. FmHA feels that the proposed language is appropriate as proposed. 



26. Section 1944.215(a)(7) 





Comment:

 There were several comments that the restriction of building design will result in all buildings being shaped like
a box. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA feels this is an overreaction and that this section will not lead to the construction of boxes. We have observed,
in many States, how a simple yet attractive design is an asset to the community. These types of simple designs do not
deter potential tenants from seeking residency. The Agency feels that the design of some of the housing units now in
existence have gone beyond what is necessary to provide decent, safe, and sanitary living units. The Housing Act of
1949, as amended, specifies that ``no loan shall be made or insured * * * unless the Secretary finds
that the construction involved will be undertaken in an economical manner and will not be of elaborate or extravagant
design or materials.'' 



27. Section 1944.215(a)(8) 





Comment:

 Two respondents recommended against setting the building roof slope limits proposed in this section, one because
of the snow loads in the northern States and the other because they could result in a building which lacks interest.




FmHA response:

 FmHA agrees with the argument against setting the lower slopes in cases where there are heavy snow loads. The wording
has been changed to allow the State Director to authorize a higher slope if needed to accommodate severe weather conditions.
The Agency disagrees with the opinion that these slopes will result in a lack of building interest. 



28. Section 1944.215(a)(9) 





Comment:

 Several respondents expressed agreement with this section. Several others felt that the use of repetitive designs
would result in ``cloned'' projects. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA does not feel that the use of repeat designs will have any detrimental effect on the aesthetic value of FmHA-financed
units. In fact, several States now require the use of repeat designs without detrimental effects. The National Office
assesses the 515 program in multiple States each year, which includes a visual inspection of the rental stock. We have
not found the use of repeat designs to be offensive or boring in any State. FmHA feels that the submission of new designs
for all projects needlessly increases the amount of Government funds needed since the amount of architectural fees
is based on the level of services provided. Repeat designs will decrease the amount being paid for architectural fees
since the use of ``shelf'' plans will reduce the detailed architectural services needed. 



29. Section 1944.215(a)(10) 





Comment:

 Several respondents stated that community room furniture should be included as an eligible loan expense; one respondent
supported the inclusion of dining room furniture in congregate housing. Another respondent supported the inclusion
of community rooms in family projects and garbage disposals. A few respondents suggested allowing sliding glass
doors where patios/balconies are permitted. One respondent suggested adding whirlpools to developmentally disabled
housing. Two respondents supported the inclusion of bay/box/picture windows. One respondent voiced support for
prohibiting fire places, garages and covered parking. Two respondents supported this section.

<PARENT> FR940214-0-00004 </PARENT>

FmHA response:

 Community and congregate dining room furniture is the responsibility of the borrower and its expense should be covered
by the initial O&M funds. Outdoor recreation facilities for family projects are allowable loan expenses and
are intended to substitute for community room facilities allowed in elderly projects. The Agency considers community
rooms to be an essential part of the daily living requirement for those elderly projects which can support the additional
expense of the facilities. The obvious reason for not allowing community rooms in family projects is that family activities
are not necessarily curtailed by age or climate and they are more mobile than elderly residents, which means their
choice of entertainment can extend beyond their living accommodations. FmHA does not feel that garbage disposals
are necessary and has recommended against financing them in the past. In addition to the initial cost of the disposal
units, too often problems develop because of lack of care in what is processed through them, resulting in additional
expense of the repairs. FmHA does not agree that sliding glass doors are necessary even when patios/balconies are
customary for the area. FmHA contends that if a developmentally disabled person requires whirlpool therapy, then
it should fall within the responsibility of a professional to provide the service at a therapist's facility. Some
of the States which were previously allowing bay/box/picture windows have discontinued this practice in accordance
with the efforts to contain costs, an action which we support. 



30. Section 1944.215(a)(11) 





Comment:

 One respondent supported the inclusion of individual patios for the elderly as a means for increasing socialization.
Two respondents supported washer and dryer hookups for all types of units. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA views the community room as instrumental in encouraging elderly tenant socialization. In a recent survey conducted
by the National Association of Home Builders, tenants were asked to list amenities in order of their desirability.
This survey showed that balconies were ranked by the tenants at number 15 out of a list of 16 amenities. We place individual
patios in the same category with balconies. See discussion of washer and dryer hookups under  1944.212(g),
above. 



31. Section 1944.215(a)(12) 





Comment:

 One respondent voiced support for allowing outdoor recreation for elderly projects for those occasions where there
are minor children in the unit and where grandchildren come to visit. There was support expressed for the allowance
for garbage disposals and community rooms for family projects. 



FmHA response:

 Playground equipment would either stand idle in the case where there were no minors living with the elderly or would
attract children from outside the project. The noise generated as a result of playgrounds would not be viewed as a welcome
addition by some of the elderly residents who enjoy peaceful surroundings. FmHA response to community rooms for family
projects and garbage disposals has already been discussed under  1944.215(a)(10) above. 



32. Section 1944.215(a)(13) 





Comment:

 Several respondents objected to the number of parking spaces for elderly since more persons now keep their cars for
a longer period of time, particularly since those persons reside in rural areas with no other means of transportation.
One respondent recommended that spaces for visitors and health care workers not be included in the calculation. One
respondent suggested that this limit be recommended and not mandated. One respondent recommended the limit be set
at 1.5 to 2 for family and .5 to 1.25 for elderly; another respondent recommended .75 to 1.25 for elderly. One respondent
supported this section. 



FmHA response:

 A 1990 congregate housing study revealed that only 21 percent of congregate tenants owned cars. The proposed allowance
for congregate parking spaces is based on that percentage. In order to accommodate the additional cars owned by persons
in elderly projects, we have changed the language of this section to allow for additional spaces for visitors and staff.




33. Section 1944.215(a)(14) 





Comment:

 A number of respondents objected to establishing a range of acceptable allowances for earthwork. A couple of respondents
mistakenly interpreted this section to mean that the allowance cover the combination of landscaping and earthwork.




FmHA response:

 FmHA's cost tracking system will allow us to capture landscaping and earthwork costs; therefore, the section has
been amended to delete the requirement that ranges be established.

34. Section 1944.215(a)(15) 





Comment:

 One respondent recommended that congregate projects where an expanded meal service is designed to provide meals
to all of the community's elderly citizen be exempted from the limitations of the Manual of Acceptable Practices (MAP).
The same respondent pointed out that the MAP is a supplement to an obsolete minimum property standards. Another respondent
pointed out that the MAP is not available in any FmHA office. One respondent agreed with this section. 



FmHA response:

 The MAP is no longer in print. Guidance pertaining to the size of these facilities can be found in Guide 2 of FmHA Instruction
1924-A. This section has been changed to reflect the proper reference. 



35. Section 1944.215(b)(1) 





Comment:

 Several respondents objected to this way of measuring square footages. Two others objected to restricting congregate
units to 110 percent of the minimum square footages since this dimension may not allow sufficient square footages
to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. One respondent voiced the opinion that setting the
square foot limits will lead to a drop to the minimum footages and adversely impact the rentability. One respondent
recommended a lower maximum square footage. One respondent recommended eliminating the reference to ``related
facilities'' since their inclusion will distort the square footage of ``living area.'' 



FmHA response:

 The methodology described in this section for calculating living area is consistent with common industry practices.
Congregate living units are not affected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. We do not understand the concern
that setting the square foot limit will lead to a drop to the minimum footages since these ranges have been in existence
for some time and have not resulted in an automatic drop in square feet. We see no reason to lower the maximum square footage
since the size of the unit can be controlled within the allowable ranges. The section has been changed to eliminate
``related facilities'' from being included in the computation of living area. 



36. Section 1944.215(e) 



Two comments were received and the respondents supported this section. 



37. Section 1944.215(w)(3) 





Comment:

 A number of respondents objected to FmHA's requiring the applicant to reveal the percentage of tax credits it will
seek. Several persons appeared to misinterpret the intent of the section. A few of the respondents felt that FmHA is
attempting to make the determination of the number of tax credit units the project will receive. One respondent suggested
that the section be amended to state that the ``market study'' will be subject to further examination and not the preapplication
itself. One respondent points out that if the project is requesting rental assistance, the affordability of basic
rent is irrelevant. One person recommended that the word ``percentage'' to changed to ``number'' to avoid confusion.
Several persons supported this section. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA regulations require that the Agency determine whether a proposed project is feasible. In order for a project
to be feasible, there must be persons of sufficient incomes to support the expenses and to amortize the loan. The market
for 515 projects depends on the existence of persons with a lower level of incomes in those cases where tax credits are
awarded to the borrower. Many market analysts are still determining need based on incomes up to the moderate level.
This becomes an issue when there is not sufficient rent subsidy for all units. In order to make a proper analysis of feasibility,
we must determine the level of incomes which will be required to support the project. Even if the applicant requests
100 percent rental assistance and there is sufficient subsidy to cover all of the units, FmHA is not absolved of its
responsibility of examining feasibility. FmHA feels that it is imperative that we are aware of the number of tax credit
units anticipated so that the appropriate level of incomes can be studied. In no way does FmHA intend to become involved
in the determination of the number of tax credits assigned to a project by the State Agencies. We will, however, provide
information to the State Agencies as to the amount of financial assistance granted to the borrower by FmHA. The word
``percentage'' has been changed to ``amount'' and the words ``percentage of units targeted for tax credit eligible
persons'' have been added. 



38. Section 1944.231(a)(2) 





Comment:

 A number of respondents supported this section with the stipulation that no other preapplication be authorized until
the second market study has been completed and a determination made on the original preapplication. Two respondents
pointed out that the 45-day period in which to respond to the applicant is not sufficient to accomplish the necessary
processing. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA agrees that the preapplication hold its position in the ranking and has amended the section to state that no other
preapplication will move ahead of the preapplication in question until the feasibility issue has been resolved.
The contracts will be similar to those used by the Agency in obtaining appraisals in that the State will let one contract
under which the market studies will be prepared by one or more market analysts. This will eliminate the need for contracting
for each individual study, thus saving processing time.

39. Section 1944.235(a)(1) 





Comment:

 Two respondents suggested that closing instructions be furnished to the borrower within a certain timeframe. 



FmHA response:

 The issuance of the closing instructions involves coordination and input from another Government Agency. While
FmHA may request more expeditious issuance of the closing instructions, it has no control over when the instructions
will be furnished. Additionally, we have no way of knowing how the process is impacted by that Agency's workload. 



40. Section 1944.235(a)(2) 





Comment:

 One respondent supported this section. Another respondent stated that this section does not agree with the earlier
requirement concerning what amount needs to be furnished to cover the initial O&M amount discussed in  1944.211(a)(7)(i).




FmHA response:

 This issue was discussed under  1944.211(a)(7)(i), above. 



41. Section 1944.235(b)(3) 





Comment:

 One respondent suggested that an appeal process be included for co-general partners. One respondent suggested that
another provision be added to allow transfer of an obligation when the applicant is unable to continue for legitimate
reasons and the transferee is eligible for 515 assistance. Another respondent suggested consideration be given
to who is responsible for the default so that a co-general partner who is innocent of the default will not be penalized
by being denied access to the program for 5 years. 



FmHA response:

 We interpret the first and last respondent comments to pertain to the same concern. FmHA does not agree that a co-general
partner be exempt from these provisions since the loan was made to the entity and it is up to the entity to maintain its
financial integrity. The regulations already contain provisions for handling cases where the entity chooses to
transfer an obligation without monetary default. There would be no penalty in that case. 



42. Section 1944.235(c)(1) 





Comment:

 One respondent suggests that the language be changed to allow interim lenders who are now making loans to only FmHA-financed
projects. Another suggested that the language be changed to state ``other than identity of interest companies.''
Another respondent felt that the record of providing financing to non-FmHA projects be on a national basis and not
limited to the State in which a particular loan is made. A respondent suggested that the language be changed to state
the lender be ``authorized'' to do business in a State since not all States require the lender to be licensed. Two respondents
suggested that FmHA provide the interim financing to eliminate the expense connected with outside interim financing.
Two other respondents voiced their objection to this section. Two respondents supported this section. 



FmHA response:

 FmHA feels strongly that the borrower not provide its own interim financing. The interim lender is responsible for
inspecting each stage of construction. If borrowers are allowed to provide their own interim financing they, in essence,
would also be allowed to inspect their own construction. FmHA feels that inspections by arms-length third parties
will provide a more objective assessment of construction standards and quality. The language has been changed to
state that the lender be ``authorized'' to do business in a State rather than ``licensed.'' As long as interim financing
can be secured at reasonable rates, fees, and terms, FmHA does not feel that the wholesale use of Government funds for
interim financing is in keeping with the intent that local lenders be given the opportunity of furnishing the interim
financing. 



43. Section 1944.236 





Comment:

 Two respondents objected to nonprofit borrowers being able to use an attorney who is a member of their organization
while limited profit borrowers are prohibited from doing the same.

FmHA response:

 The only change being made to this section is to correspond to a recent wording change in FmHA's closing regulation.
The use of member attorneys by nonprofit groups has been allowed by the regulation for some time. FmHA does not consider
the relationship between a nonprofit borrower and its attorney in any way resembles the relationship between a profit-motivated
borrower and its attorney. The nonprofit attorney has no financial interest in the nonprofit whereas the reverse
can be true of the attorney who is a member of the limited profit. 



44. Section 1944.237(a) 





Comment:

 One respondent suggested that this section be amended to make clear that subsequent loans to existing borrowers for
rehabilitation do not have to go through the preapplication process. Another respondent felt that this will adversely
affect developers who acquired land for a future second phase. Another respondent recommended that this section
show what types of paperwork are needed for a subsequent loan or that the information be contained in an exhibit to the
regulation. Two respondents expressed their opinion that the language which states that subsequent loans made on
or after December 15, 1989, cannot be prepaid is contrary to prior interpretations by the National Office. Another
person suggested that this section be revised to permit the addition of office, laundry, maintenance, or other community
space not be subject to rating and ranking. One respondent agreed with this section. 



FmHA response:

 This section states that subsequent loans to develop additional units must be rated and ranked. All other subsequent
loans which do not fall within this definition are excluded, including rehabilitation of existing FmHA-financed
units. It was always FmHA's intention that subsequent loans to develop additional units be subject to the rating system;
this section merely clarifies that intention. FmHA agrees that some guidance be added to the regulation which better
defines what types of paperwork are required for subsequent loans. The types of paperwork needed for subsequent loans
has been added to the regulation as Exhibit A-14. Prepayment is covered by proposed changes now being incorporated
in FmHA regulations. Office, laundry, maintenance, and other community space facilities are not considered living
units and do not fall under this definition. 



45. Exhibit A 



Paragraph IV.B.6

 Two respondents expressed their opinion that no new AD-622 be issued until the market question is resolved.

46. Exhibit A-2 





Comment:

 One respondent felt that a new column ``housing condition'' be added to this exhibit. 



FmHA response:

 The respondent did not make known whether the reference to housing condition refers to the overall condition or to
the interior condition of the units. If the latter, we have deliberately not required this type of information since
it would be almost impossible for a market analyst to inspect the inside of the units. In the case of the overall exterior
condition of the property, FmHA feels this analysis is subject to the personal feelings of the analyst and would not
be based on any uniform means for ranking the physical condition. FmHA does require the analyst to give an opinion as
to the upkeep of the existing stock in accordance with Exhibit A-8, ``Outline of Professional Market Study.''



47. Exhibit A-7 


Paragraph I.A 





Comment:

 There were many objections raised to this section that requires an audited financial statement. It was pointed out
that, even if individual financial statements could be audited, the cost for providing the original and updates during
the processing period would be prohibitive. These same individuals objected to providing a copy of their prior year
income tax return because it is deemed an invasion of privacy. One respondent pointed out the hardship this would create
for nonprofit applicants and proposed that they be able to provide their most recent audited statement. One respondent
supported this section but suggested that ``current'' be defined as the end of the company's last fiscal year and that
updates be unaudited. One respondent suggested that instead of requiring audited financial statements, a good review
of financial statements by FmHA personnel would ensure financial security. Several persons pointed out the fact
that most applicants are newly established organizations which have no financial record to audit. One respondent
representing a Certified Public Accounting firm stated that it is often impracticable to conduct an examination
of personal financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and to express an unqualified
opinion. That respondent recommended the section be changed to require that the personal financial statements either
be compiled or reviewed and stated that a detailed and complete underwriting of creditworthiness can be performed
on compiled or reviewed personal financial statements that are comprehensively prepared. Two respondents supported
this section.

FmHA response:

 In light of the difficulty in obtaining audited financial statements of individuals, FmHA will continue with the
requirements currently in existence and has eliminated the word ``audited'' from this section. The Agency also feels
that a proper analysis of a financial statement will provide a better understanding of an applicant's creditworthiness
than would an individual's income tax statement. FmHA maintains the position that a financial statement not be more
than 6 months old when the preapplication is filed. 


48. Exhibit A-7 


Paragraph I.H 


Respondents agreed with this section. 


49. Exhibit A-7 


Paragraph II.A





Comment:

 One respondent recommended that FmHA establish a percentage of elderly homeowners that could be considered as potential
tenants. Two respondents disagreed with the use of a checklist in evaluating market studies. A few respondents disagreed
with limiting the area of consideration to 20 percent of the substandard rental units. Two respondents objected to
the use of professional market studies in the analysis of need and suggested that personal contact with possible tenants,
talking with other apartment owners, or conducting a newspaper questionnaire would provide a more credible means
for determining need. One respondent suggested that we include a definition of ``substandard units.'' Also, that
respondent pointed out that the same persons who reside in ``overcrowded'' units are being doublecounted, first
from the substandard category and second from the new households category. One respondent agreed with this section.




FmHA response:

 FmHA does not agree that elderly homeowners should be considered in the need for units. That is not to say these elderly
homeowners cannot live in the FmHA-financed unit. We do not feel that the general market can absorb the sale of multiple
homes at one time. Exhibit A-8 does state that if the economic conditions reflect normal selling times for homes
in the market area, then elderly homeowners may be considered as a secondary market. FmHA has had in use a checklist
for analyzing market studies for some time; this regulation now requires its use to enhance internal control over
administration of the program. The purpose of the checklist is to enable the reviewer to determine if all segments
of Exhibit A-8 have been addressed by the study.

Market demand and feasibility is created by several factors. One of those factors is the demand created by persons
who are living in substandard units and seeking decent, safe and sanitary housing which can be financed by FmHA. Currently,
there is no limit on the percentage of substandard units which an analyst can project in determining market demand.
For example, if there are 100 units of substandard housing in a given market, analysts can and have stated that 80, or
any other arbitrary, percentage of the families living in these units create a portion of the demand. We have found
that the percentage of units projected as a result of substandard housing varies significantly from study to study.
In addition, without any boundaries, it provides the market analyst with a contingency to justify demand. The 20 percent
limitation was offered based upon previous experience with market analysis. Without a threshold, FmHA is defenseless
in challenging a professional market analyst. It is reasonable to set a limit since there is no objective methodology
in which to actually determine how many people residing in substandard units will move to a newly completed Section
515 complex. The Agency will, however, allow a higher number if the analyst can clearly document that the occupants
of more than 20 percent of the occupied substandard rental units are willing and able to relocate to the proposed housing.
The documentation will be in the form of signed survey sheets prepared expressly to capture such information.

The use of market studies does not prohibit anyone from doing more to assess the market, such as making local contacts.
Placing a questionnaire in a newspaper does not ensure the return of any responses. A definition of substandard has
been added.

FmHA feels it necessary to standardize the way need is calculated in order to provide some uniformity in market studies.
The revised Exhibit A-8 outlines the sources of demand which will be accepted by the Agency. There was a discrepancy
between this section and the Exhibit A-8 language in delineating sources of need. This section of the regulation
has been changed to agree with the language of Exhibit A-8. 



Paragraph II.F





Comment:

 One respondent suggested that the tax credit income information be provided with the application and not with the
preapplication. 



FmHA response:

 Feasibility must be determined during the preapplication stage and the ranges of local incomes must be established
at that time. For this reason, the Agency cannot change this requirement. Other discussions concerning tax credit
incomes is found under  1944.215(w)(3). 



50. Exhibit A-7 



Paragraph III.C





Comment:

 One respondent suggested adding a provision that the option to buy be with the current owner of public record. 



FmHA response:

 We agree with this suggestion and have added that provision. 



51. Exhibit A-7 



Paragraph IV.F





Comment:

 One respondent objected to applicants who publicly bid their projects having to submit a Form FmHA 1924-13.
One respondent felt that requesting this much detail information at the preapplication stage would not prove useful
since cost estimates change markedly between preapplication and application. One respondent supported this section.




FmHA response:

 FmHA's new cost tracking system will track the trade item costs of each project. The Form FmHA 1924-13 provides
a breakdown of trade item costs which will readily facilitate the use of the cost tracking system. Otherwise, the value
of the tracking system will be diminished, thus not allowing the Agency to establish cost data comparisons. Persons
submitting bids must have prepared extensive cost estimates in preparing the bid. Therefore, we do not feel this will
cause an undue burden on the contractor.

Comment:

 One respondent suggested that a definition of substandard be included. One respondent asked if FmHA intends to prepare
and distribute special tabulations of substandard units by its definition, by occupancy, tenure, income, and household
size. Several respondents expressed objection to FmHA not considering elderly homeowners as a basis of need. Several
respondents objected to the 20 percent ceiling on substandard units which FmHA will accept in the determination of
need. One respondent raised the question of who is responsible for determining if the analyst is qualified and what
the qualifications are for preparing a study. That person also wanted to know if the study is incomplete, is the preapplication
determined incomplete and returned to the applicant. Two respondents felt that requiring the market analyst to make
an on-site visit was a significant improvement in this exhibit. One respondent suggested that the exhibit be used
as a guide only and not mandated. One respondent asked if FmHA intended to exclude rentoverburden households from
rentup demand estimates. That respondent also expressed an opinion that the listing of small businesses in the Site
section of the exhibit would be construed to mean those businesses must be available in order for a community to be considered
eligible for FmHA financing. Other comments and suggestions offered on the technical content of the exhibit are too
numerous to list here. 



FmHA response:

 A definition for substandard has been included. HUD furnished FmHA with information pertaining to occupancy in substandard
units based on the 1980 census. That information was disseminated to our field staff for distribution to market analysts.
We are in the process of coordinating with HUD to obtain this same data when it becomes available. (See discussion of
elderly homeowners under Exhibit A-7, Paragraph II.A. and a discussion of substandard housing under Exhibit
A-7, Paragraph II.A). The qualifications of a market analyst and the responsibility for determining whether
an analyst is qualified are iterated in Exhibit A-7 of this instruction. If a market study is incomplete, the
applicant may furnish additional information to complement the market study without the necessity of returning
the entire preapplication. This will inevitably delay the processing of the preapplication. The requirement that
a market analyst visit the site of the proposed project was not introduced with this revision; it has always been a requirement.
The purpose of the exhibit is to require enough information on which a feasibility decision can be based and to establish
uniformity in the content of studies. Prior to FmHA issuing the exhibit, the market studies varied greatly and all
did not contain the most basic types of information. We have seen a marked improvement in the studies because of the
issuance of the exhibit. While FmHA originally allowed applicants to consider the exhibit as a guideline, we did not
feel it prudent to continue this practice. The exhibit is, therefore, required in order for the study to be acceptable
to the Agency; market studies which do not contain Exhibit A-8 requirements will not be acceptable. We understand
that the HUD information on rentoverburdened households is not yet available. In the interim, language has been added
to the exhibit which invites the analyst to include this type of information where available. While this exhibit is
not the proper vehicle for establishing policies concerning required community services and facilities, the Site
section has been reworded to state that the businesses listed are an example of the types of business which may be located
in the community. 

Many of the proposed changes are based on comments and recommendations submitted from market analysts over the past
two years. Market analysts have expressed differing opinions concerning the content of this exhibit. We have considered
all of these differing opinions and have amended the exhibit to include what we consider a rational and understandable
basis for a market study. We have attempted to correct the original exhibit requirements where it lacked sufficient
statistics to make a determination for elderly and congregate projects. Other changes made to the exhibit will standardize
the types of information market studies will contain and provide the uniformity heretofore missing. We have considered
all comments and the exhibit now reflects those changes which FmHA has determined appropriate for inclusion.

Comment:

 A few respondents recommended that the market information be updated after 12 months rather than requiring a new study.

(iv) 

Contract cost breakdown. 

In any case where the loan approval official feels it appropriate, and prior to the award or approval of any contract
in which there is an identity of interest as defined in  1924.4 (i) of this subpart, the contractor and any subcontractor,
material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must provide the applicant and FmHA with a trade-item
cost breakdown of the proposed contract amount for evaluation. The cost of any surety as required by  1944.222
(h) and (i) of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and  1924.6 (a)(3) of this subpart, or cost certification
as required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, will be included in the proposed contract amount and shown under
General Requirements on Form FmHA 1924-13, which is available in all FmHA offices. FmHA personnel will be responsible
for reviewing the estimates on Form FmHA 1924-13 to determine if the dollar amounts total correctly, to assure
that costs are categorized under their appropriate columns, and to confirm that the estimated costs for all line items
are reasonable and customary for the State. 

(v) 

Cost certification. 

Whenever the State Director determines it appropriate, and in all situations where there is an identity of interest
as defined in  1924.4 (i) of this subpart, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier,
or equipment lessor having an identity of interest must each provide certification using Form FmHA 1924-13
as to the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the construction contract. The construction costs,
as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13, must also be audited, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, by
a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970. In addition, certain agreed upon procedures (available in any
FmHA office) will be performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA will contract directly
with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction
certified by an FmHA contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13,
will be provided. Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed
because FmHA contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan. FmHA personnel will utilize Exhibit
M of this subpart (available in any FmHA office) and Form FmHA 
1924-26, ``Cost Certification Worksheet,'' to assist in the evaluation of the cost certification process.


(A) Prior to the start of construction, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment
lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the borrower, contractor,
subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining
a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the borrower must provide a written assertion that it
has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost
as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form FmHA 1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will
be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment,
and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also restrict
costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent
CPA or LPA shall report on the borrower's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The borrower's and the CPA or LPA's reports on
the accounting system shall be provided to FmHA by the borrower. 

(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared
to the estimated cost must be provided to the owner and FmHA. Form FmHA 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown
that must be used, and contains the certifications required of the applicant and contractor prior to final payment.
The amounts for builder's general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements, respectively, shall not
exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv)
of this section for any contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity
of interest with the borrower. The amounts for general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements must
be established prior to FmHA approving the construction contract and will not be changed during the course of construction.
This applies to all contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, or equipment lessors having or sharing an
identity of interest with the applicant. Contract change orders will be processed to adjust the contract amount downward
prior to the final payment to the contractor, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown in the certificate of actual
costs do not exceed the amounts represented in the contract cost breakdown. Reduction in the builder's profit, and
general overhead if needed, will counterbalance any increase reflected in the contract costs. Any funds remaining
as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes
approved by FmHA as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All
increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases
and/or decreases. The State Director may require documentation for increases and/or decreases of less than 15 percent,
if he/she determines it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification.

(C) The CPA or LPA audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the
accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the borrower and the contractor (and any subcontractor,
material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services
rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract he/she considers necessary to express
an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13. The CPA or LPA shall also perform the additional
agreed upon procedures specified by FmHA (available in any FmHA office), performed in accordance with Attestation
Standards, for the applicant and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor
sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance
with the construction contract. 

(D) Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether
the construction costs, as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity
with eligible construction costs as prescribed in FmHA regulations. 

(E) In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by FmHA through direct contract with the CPA or LPA. The borrower
and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation necessary to
conduct the certification. FmHA reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form FmHA 1924-13
and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to FmHA. If not satisfactory to FmHA, the borrower will be
responsible for providing additional information. 

(F) There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of
the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as
the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting
records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project. 
 
(G) Forms FmHA 1944-30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate'' and FmHA 1944-31, ``Identity
of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' provide written notification to the borrower that willful and intentional
falsification of cost certification documents will result in debarment of all violators in accordance with the provisions
of FmHA Instruction 1940-M (available in any FmHA office). These forms require the disclosure of all identities
of interest associated with project construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted service,
and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such certification. Each applicant/borrower will be required
to complete and sign the forms (available in any FmHA office). 

(H) Subcontracting development work. 
 
(

1

) Contractors will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction.
``Actual construction'' means ``work'' as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) documents: ``* * *
labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.''
Under this definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor
will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when: 

(

i

) More than 50 percent of the contract sum in the construction contract is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material
supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or 

(

ii

) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers and/or equipment lessors.


(

2

) 

Note

: If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor. 
 
(

3

) How to apply rule: 

(

i

) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the contract sum of the construction
contract results in more than 50 percent. 

(

ii

) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the contract
sum of the construction contract results in 75 percent or more. 

(I) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual
or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify
that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends
to contract. Form FmHA 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The form provides
notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein.
Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance
with the provisions of FmHA Instruction 1940-M (available in any FmHA office).

) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director
determines that the requirements have been met and the costs are reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding
may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file. 



* * * * * 



(2) * * * 

(i) * * * 

(B) Dated and signed financial statements on the owner-builder's operation (including balance sheets and statements
of income and expense) from current and prior years indicating the payment status of the owner-builder's accounts
and any contingent liabilities that may exist. FmHA personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement
as to the sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out construction. The financial strength
must demonstrate the ability of the owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from
the lender. 



* * * * * 



(G) A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the estimated total development cost of the project
which has been prepared by the applicant/owner-builder. Form FmHA 1924-13 will be used for this purpose. If
cost certification services are required by FmHA, the cost of such services may be included in the total development
cost of the project. Any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with
the applicant/owner-builder as defined in  1924.4(i) of this subpart must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown
of the proposed amount. 

(H) Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment
lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the owner-builder,
subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining
a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion
that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual
cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form FmHA 1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item
will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies,
equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also
restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled.
The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation
Engagements of the AICPA. The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided
to FmHA by the owner-builder. 



* * * * * 



(ii) * * * 

(C) The total development cost of the project does not exceed that which is typical for similar type projects in the
area. The total development cost recognized by FmHA for each individual case will be determined by the MFH Coordinator
with the advice of the State Architect. 



* * * * * 



(iii) * * * 

(A) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director
determines that the requirements have been met and the construction cost is reasonable, an exception to competitive
bidding may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application
file. 



* * * * * 



(iv) The development cost of the project may include a typical allowance for general overhead, general requirements
and a builder's profit. These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data for the area.
The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractors, material suppliers and equipment lessors having or sharing
an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead,
and general requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost breakdown.

(v) Under no circumstances will loan funds be used to pay the owner/builder or its stockholders, members, directors
or officers, directly or indirectly, any profits from the construction of the project except a typical builder's
fee for performing the services that would normally be performed by a general contractor under the contract method
of construction. Discounts and rebates given the owner-builder in advance must be deducted before the invoices are
paid. If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds must be returned to the supervised bank
account or applied on the interim construction loan, as appropriate. Under no circumstances will the dollar amount
be placed in the reserve account. 



* * * * * 



(viii) The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity
of interest as defined in  1924.4(i) of this subpart must each provide certification as to the actual cost of
the work performed in connection with the construction of the project on Form FmHA 1924-13 prior to final payment.
The construction costs, as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13, must be audited by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before
December 31, 1970, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and certain agreed upon procedures (available
in any FmHA office) performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA will contract directly
with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction
certified by an FmHA contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13,
will be provided. Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed
because FmHA contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan. 
 
(A) The CPA or LPA's audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the applicant/owner-builder (and any subcontractor,
material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services
rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction of the project he/she considers necessary
to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form FmHA 1924-13. Upon completion of construction
and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion as to whether the construction costs as reported on
Form FmHA 1924-13 present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs
as prescribed in FmHA regulations. FmHA reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form FmHA 1924-13
and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to FmHA. At a minimum, the CPA or LPA shall also perform any
additional agreed upon procedures (available in any FmHA office) specified by FmHA, performed in accordance with
Attestation Standards, of the owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing
an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection
with the construction. There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for
the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any
CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains
the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project. 

(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, FmHA must be provided with a certification and a trade-item
breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost furnished in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G)
of this section. Form FmHA 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certification
required of the applicant/owner-builder prior to final payment. The amounts for builder's general overhead, general
requirements, and builder's profit shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided
in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section for the owner-builder or any subcontractor, material
supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. Final
payment to the owner-builder will be adjusted, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown on the certificate of
actual cost do not exceed the amounts represented on the cost breakdown. Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost
savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by FmHA as long
as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All increases or decreases
of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases or decreases.
The State Director may require documentation for increases or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines
it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification. 

(C) Subcontracting development work. 

(

1

) Owner-builders will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction.
``Actual construction'' means ``work'' as defined in AIA documents: ``* * * labor, materials, equipment,
and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.'' Under this definition, owner-builders
who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general
overhead and profit) when: 

(

i

) More than 50 percent of the total cost of the building construction is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material
supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or 

(

ii

) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers, and/or equipment lessors.

Note: 

If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor.

* * * * *



(d) 

Obligations incurred before loan closing.

 When an applicant files a preapplication for a loan, the servicing official will advise the applicant not to start
construction or incur any indebtedness until the loan is closed, except for those cases involving interim financing;
the guidelines outlined in  1944.235(c)(1) of this subpart will then apply. During the period of preapplication
review and processing, applicants will not take any actions with respect to their applications which would have an
adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. This requirement does not preclude
the applicant from developing preliminary plans or designs or performing other work necessary to support an application
for Federal, State, or local permits or assistance. If the applicant incurs debts for work, materials, land purchase,
or other authorized fees and charges before the loan is closed, the State Director may authorize the use of loan funds
to pay the debts when all of the following conditions exist and debts were authorized in writing by FmHA prior to their
being incurred (market studies will be exempt from this requirement):

(ii) Prior to the date of preapplication as part of a predevelopment loan specifically intended as temporary financing
from a public agency or nonprofit organization and the State Director secures prior concurrence from the National
Office; or 



* * * * *



(e) * * *

(1) No increase in per unit development cost will be approved, whether the circumstance causing the cost increase
occurs before, during, or after the construction period, unless these conditions were unforeseen factors beyond
the owner's control and the increase in cost was approved by FmHA in writing before the expense was incurred. (In case
of an emergency, the requirement that the cost be approved by FmHA in writing before the expense is incurred is waived
as long as the servicing official is notified by the next working day.) Such costs are:

15. Section 1944.215 is amended in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) by adding the words ``(available in any FmHA office)'' at
the end of the paragraph; by revising in paragraph (h)(1) the words ``What is Cooperative Housing?'' to read ``A Guide
to Cooperative Housing''; and by revising paragraph (a), the introductory text of paragraphs (b) and (b)(1), paragraph
(b)(1)(i), and the introductory text of paragraph (e) and by adding paragraph (w)(3) to read as follows: 



 1944.215 

Special conditions. 



(a) 

Cost containment.

 To achieve affordable rents and occupancy rates (not considering rental assistance or similar subsidies), all development
costs will be economical in nature and not include costs for unnecessary or elaborate design features. Cost containment
is not to be interpreted as accepting poor design or cheap construction. Projects must provide the features and amenities
necessary for the lifestyles of the tenants and members. Consideration must be given to the cost/benefit ratio when
evaluating, recommending, or requiring specific design features or construction techniques. Life cycle cost analysis
will be employed to determine the types of materials which will reduce operation/maintenance costs even though their
initial costs are higher. Operation and maintenance costs factored into proposed operating budgets will be adjusted
accordingly. The following guidelines are to be followed when developing projects:

<PARENT> FR940214-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Each State architect/engineer (A/E) will compile and maintain data on costs of all projects. Total project estimates
will be compared with estimates available through the Marshall & Swift computer program. These estimates, along
with the line item costs recorded in FmHA's Automated Multi-Housing Accounting System (AMAS) cost tracking system,
will be used to establish a benchmark for future project costs. Any proposal that exceeds these costs must be carefully
evaluated for possible cost reductions. The borrower will be responsible for resolving the differences in cost to
bring the project into line with the lesser of the cost tracking system or Marshall & Swift estimates. Final determinations
must be realistic, interrelated to maintenance and operation costs, and based upon local conditions and common sense.
The State will consider circumstances such as high land costs, remote rural areas, etc., which could present a problem
in achieving such an alignment of costs. The AMAS cost tracking system will be used to record both estimates and actual
line item costs. At the time the preapplication estimates are being examined by FmHA, the percentages for builder's
profit, general overhead, and general requirements will be calculated to determine if they are within the allowable
percentages established in this paragraph. They will again be calculated at the time the final estimates are submitted
to FmHA. Estimated amounts in excess of the allowable percentages will be reduced to the appropriate percentage.
Once the final estimates are approved by FmHA, payment of builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements
will not exceed the estimated amounts. Allowable percentages for builder's profit, general overhead, and general
requirements will not exceed 10 percent, 4 percent, and 7 percent, respectively. This will not be interpreted to mean
that, if historical percentages for these costs were below 10, 4, and 7, respectively, FmHA will allow the costs to
be increased automatically. Adequate justification and documentation will be required to approve an increase to
10, 4, or 7 percent for cases where any of the costs were previously below those levels. 
 
(2) The elimination or reduction of unnecessary delays in application processing can contribute to cost containment
through lower interest and other business expenses on land, inventory, tests, design studies, etc. When reasonable
processing timeframes are established, known and followed, appropriate time can be planned for preparing quality
application and construction documents. This can result in better instructions to the builder, fewer errors and
lower construction costs. 
 
(3) Most materials and systems are available in a range of qualities and prices. The construction documents will be
carefully reviewed for specifications that require qualities or grades higher than necessary. These specifications
will be accepted only if fully justified and no reasonable alternatives are available. 

(4) Designs which employ standard building material dimensions and reduce waste will be used. 

(5) Sites will require a minimum amount of site development work. The State Director may authorize a site requiring
higher than normal site development costs only if: 

(i) The proposed site and site development costs are less than the cost of the normal site and site development costs;
or 

(ii) There are no other sites available in the market area with a lower combined cost. 

(6) All project site densities (units per acre) will be within the following ranges, regardless of site conditions
unless local zoning requirements dictate otherwise: 







</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940214-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940214-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




(i) For example: A 24-unit project composed of two-story buildings must have a site of at least 1.3 acres. FmHA will
finance the purchase and development of larger sites, but not more than 1.7 acres. Ranges for projects with a mixture
of building heights can be interpolated. 

(ii) An exception may be made to this provision only if the site in question is the only site available in the market area
and its size, shape, or condition makes a portion of the site unsuitable for building. An exception to this requirement
must be granted by the State Director or a designee. The applicant must provide written documentation that no other
sites are available. 

(7) Sound judgment and common sense must also be used in construction inspections and final acceptance of projects.
Field staff involved in these activities must be careful not to impose additional or unreasonable requirements on
the builder that will increase construction costs. States should consider hiring enough construction inspectors
to provide more than the required inspections and to allow multiple unscheduled and unannounced visits. The State
Office may also, with National Office authorization, contract for inspection services to deter deviations from
the FmHA-accepted construction documents. Prefinal and final inspections must be conducted by qualified FmHA personnel.


(8) Buildings will not include numerous wall and roof breaks, unusual designs requiring excessive corners and foundation
off-sets, or that require more exterior entrances than absolutely necessary. Designs will not be considered acceptable
that place dining facilities in structures attached to the main building when these amenities can be less expensively
included within the main structure. 

(9) Buildings will not include roof slopes less than 3/12 nor greater than 6/12 unless otherwise required by local
authorities or in order to accommodate severe weather conditions. 
 
(10) The use of repeat designs will be required from applicants whose architects have designed projects previously
approved by FmHA. This does not mean ``cloned'' projects are required throughout the State and/or region. When a repeat
design is being used in the same community, the exterior facade (such as color, siding material, etc.) must be noticeably
changed except in the case of subsequent phases. The State Office architect will ensure that sufficient differences
are included in the proposed plans which will preclude the appearance of ``cloned'' designs. ``Predesigned'' buildings
must fit the basic existing contours of the proposed site. 

(11) The following facilities are considered nonessential and will not be included in the loan unless required by
local codes or ordinances: 

(i) Garages/covered parking; 

(ii) Bay/box/picture or similar type windows; 

(iii) Fireplaces; 

(iv) Community room furniture; 

(v) Sliding glass/atrium or similar type doors; 

(vi) Materials atypical for the area; 

(vii) Atriums/solariums; 

(viii) Saunas; 

(ix) Whirlpools; 

(x) Gyms (facilities to accommodate physical exercises may be included in elderly projects without regard to this
restriction); and 

(xi) Swimming pools. 

(12) Other design features which will only be accepted if determined customary for the area are:

(i) Patios/balconies (minimum size which will 
accommodate handicapped accessibility); 

(ii) Washer and dryer hookups in individual 
units; and 

(iii) Washers and dryers in individual units. 

(13) The following is a list of allowable amenities according to the type of units:

(14) Total on-site parking spaces per living unit will be within the following ranges unless otherwise required by
local authorities:







Note:

 Additional spaces for visitors, staff, or health care workers may be provided.






(15) Management, maintenance, and community rooms should be in accordance with Guide 2 of subpart A of part 1924 of
this chapter (available in any FmHA office). Laundry rooms should be no larger than necessary to accommodate equipment,
circulation (including handicapped accessibility) and areas for sorting and folding clothes. 

(b) 

Type of housing.

 All housing will be designed to: 

(1) Be economically constructed and not of elaborate design or materials. All new construction will conform with
the applicable development standards of  1924.5(d)(1) of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter. The gross square
foot living area of new units will be within the ranges listed below. Living area is defined as: All enclosed space for
the unit (except unfinished storage space for outdoor items and space needed for heating and/or cooling equipment)
and measured from the exterior surface of the framing of exterior walls and the center line of interior party or corridor
walls. States should establish ranges within these dimensions to be commensurate with unit sizes in the local market.
For example, when conventional units in the market are at the low end of FmHA's range scale, FmHA will also build a comparably
smaller unit. 






(i) An additional 100 to 120 square feet of living area may be added to the 4-bedroom unit guideline for each bedroom
in excess of four. Floor areas for living and dining rooms should comply with Guide 2 of subpart A of part 1924 of this
chapter (available in any FmHA office). The maximum square footage in congregate housing units will not exceed 110
percent of the minimum square footages listed above. 



* * * * *

 


(e) 

Loan resolution or loan agreement.

 The loan resolution or loan agreement contains provisions of policy and procedure which should be carefully read,
fully understood by the applicant, and executed by the applicant prior to loan approval. If any provisions are not
appropriate to a particular case, proposed substitute language must be approved by FmHA and OGC. Subpart C of part
1930 of this chapter provides for the maintenance of certain accounts and the pledge of housing income as security.
It contains regulatory provisions governing and giving FmHA power to impose requirements regarding the housing
and related operations of the applicant. All sections and requirements determined applicable by OGC will form part
of any other loan resolution or agreement that may be submitted by the applicant. These are: 



* * * * *



(w) * * *

(3) Feasibility for projects receiving tax credits will require a more extensive examination since tax credits are
predicated on renting to very-low income persons. Applicants choosing to apply for tax credits will be responsible
for identifying the amount of tax credits it anticipates requesting from the State, as well as the income percentage
on which the credits will be based, and the percentage of units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. The market
study must substantiate the presence of persons whose incomes would qualify for tax credits who cannot afford the
basic rent and those persons whose incomes are tax credit eligible but who are still able to afford the basic rent.

16. Section 1944.222 is amended in paragraph (g) by adding the words ``from the current owner of public record'' at
the end of the first sentence. 


 1944.224 

[Amended]



17. Section 1944.224 is amended in paragraph (a)(3)(i) by revising the reference to `` 1944.211 (a)(6)(ii)''
to read `` 1944.211 (a)(6)(i).'' 
18. Section 1944.231 is amended by removing the definitions for ``District Director'' and ``District Office'' in
paragraph (a), by redesignating paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(4) as paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(5), respectively,
by adding a paragraph (e)(2), and by revising the introductory text of paragraph (e) to read as follows: 


 1944.231 

Processing preapplications. 


* * * * * 


(e) 

Determining eligibility and feasibility. 

After rating the preapplication, if the priority processing point score is sufficient to potentially authorize
issuance of an AD-622 inviting a formal application within the next 24 months (except for RCH preapplications),
the servicing official will review the proposal to determine eligibility, feasibility, and compliance with loan
purposes, policies, and regulations. Eligibility/feasibility reviews will be completed in priority point score
order. Where a tie in priority point score exists, the order of review will be determined in accordance with paragraph
(c)(5) of this section. In cases where the market study is incomplete or not in accordance with Exhibit A-8 of
this subpart, applicants will be required to have the study supplemented to agree with FmHA requirements. The time
involved in supplementing the market study will cause the preapplication to be delayed in determining feasibility.



* * * * * 


(2) In those cases where the need for new rental units is questioned by the servicing official, another market study
may be obtained by the servicing office at its discretion through contract with a market analyst. The same market analyst
who provided an assessment for the applicant will not be used. Issuance of all AD-622s in that market area will
be delayed until the FmHA market study has been completed and its contents reviewed by FmHA. 


* * * * * 


19. Section 1944.235 is amended by removing paragraph (a)(1); by redesignating paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5)
as paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4), respectively; by revising newly redesignated paragraph (a)(2) and the introductory
text of paragraph (c)(1); and by adding paragraphs (b)(3) and (c)(1)(viii) to read as follows: 


 1944.235 

Actions subsequent to loan approval. 


(a) * * * 

(2) Ensure that the servicing office has on file evidence that a deposit has been made to the general operating account
of an amount of initial operating capital sufficient to cover the expected start-up costs. 


* * * * * 


(b) * * * 

(3) Monetary default by original applicant/entity. An obligation may be transferred to any person or applicant eligible
to receive an RRH loan when the original applicant/entity is in monetary default which has or may result in foreclosure
by the interim lender, and: 
(i) The applicant/entity assuming the obligation, or the interim lender, removes any liens filed against the property;

(ii) There have been no deviations from the FmHA approved plans and specifications; 
(iii) The transferee will not be composed of any principals of the transferor; 
(iv) The transfer will be in the best interest of the FmHA and prospective tenants; 
(v) The applicant/entity and all members thereof whose obligations are transferred will not be considered eligible
for further participation in the RRH program for at least 5 years from the date of the transfer of the FmHA loan obligation;
and 
(vi) Prior approval is obtained from the National Office. 
(c) * * * 
(1) 

Interim financing. 

When the amount of the loan exceeds $50,000, the applicant may obtain interim financing from commercial or public
sources for the construction period if it can be obtained at reasonable interest rates, fees, and terms, and in the
best financial interests of the Government. Interim financing will be obtained to preclude the necessity for multiple
advances of FmHA funds. The interim lender must be authorized to operate in the State in which the project will be located
and must have an established record of providing financing to entities other than FmHA-financed projects. Since
the interim lender is responsible for inspecting construction along with FmHA, the borrowing entity (including
any of its identity of interest entities) cannot provide interim financing to its own project. Interim financing
will be used subject to the following: 


* * * * * 


(viii) Because interest rates can fluctuate between the time construction estimates are finalized and completion
of construction, any excess funds remaining from interim financing will be returned on the FmHA loan. Also, interim
funds remaining because of early completion of construction will be returned. The leftover interest may be used for
certain other eligible loan purposes critical to the completion of the project which were unknown to the applicant
and contractor at the time the loan was approved, provided prior National Office concurrence is obtained. 


* * * * * 


 1944.236

[Amended]


20. Section 1944.236 is amended in paragraph (c)(3) by revising the reference `` 1944.215 (d)'' to read `` 1944.215
(c).'' 
21. Section 1944.237 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c)(2) to read as follows: 


 1944.237 

Subsequent loans. 


(a) A subsequent loan is made to an applicant/borrower to complete, improve, repair, and/or make modifications to
the project initially financed by FmHA, or for equity and/or other purposes when authorized by the provisions of subpart
E of part 1965 of this chapter to avert prepayment. A subsequent loan to develop additional units must be rated and ranked
in accordance with the priority point system contained in  1944.231 of this subpart. Other subsequent loan
requests do not have to compete for funding under the priority point system. 


* * * * * 


(c) * * * 
(2) If the initial investment and 2 percent O and M amounts are sufficient to cover only the initial FmHA loan, the applicant/borrower
must provide the additional respective amounts to cover the subsequent loan. The 2 percent O and M amounts must be in
the form of cash as described in  1944.211 (a)(6) of this subpart. The required amount of the initial investment
is described in  1944.213 (b) of this subpart.

H. Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) requires that applicants disclose identities of interest that will exist
in the development of the proposed housing. Forms FmHA 1944-30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate,''
and 1944-31, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' (available in any FmHA office) will be completed
and submitted as part of the preapplication package. 


* * * * * 



II. * * * 


A. Economic justification and project size should be based on the housing need and demand from eligible prospective
tenants or members who are permanent residents of the community and its surrounding trade area. Since the intent of
the program is to provide adequate housing for the eligible permanent residents of the community, temporary residents
of a community (such as college students in a college town, military personnel stationed at a military installation
within the trade area, or others not claiming their current residence as their legal domicile) should be discounted
in determining need and project size. The market study will reflect the types and sizes of units which are needed in
the market area. For example, if the full market analysis shows a need for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom,
and four-bedroom units, the preapplication must contain a percentage of three- and four-bedroom units to correspond
to the need expressed by the market study in order to accommodate the larger families. The need will not be based on persons
who own their own homes but will be derived from: 
(1) Persons migrating into the area; 
(2) Persons dwelling in family units who desire to move into their own units (elderly persons living with family members
will only be considered if evidence of their interest in moving into the project is furnished with the market study);

(3) Conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households living in substandard rental housing (lacking
complete plumbing facilities or 1.01 or more persons per room). (A higher percentage will be allowed only if it can
be clearly documented by signed survey sheets, developed expressly for this purpose, that occupants of more than
20 percent of the occupied substandard rental units are willing and able to move into the proposed project.); 
(4) Demolition of rental stock; 
(5) Allowance for a 5 percent vacancy rate in the growth of households since the last census; and 
(6) Conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households experiencing rent overburden provided the analyst
has made a determination there are sufficient households in the market area to occupy any rental units vacated by those
lower income persons who choose to move into the proposed project from the existing units. 
B. A detailed study based upon data obtained from census reports, State or county data centers, individual employers,
industrial directories, or chambers of commerce is required. FmHA personnel will utilize the market study checklist
found at Exhibit A-12 of this subpart (available in any FmHA office) as a means for measuring market study credibility.
The study will include: 


* * * * * 


C. Exhibit A-8 of this subpart outlines the information which professional rental market studies will be required
to follow. The qualifications of the person preparing the market study should include some housing or demographic
experience. The market study will be used by FmHA in evaluating market feasibility but will not be the sole factor in
such a determination. The data and information provided in the market study will be used to supplement FmHA's knowledge
of the market area and to facilitate rational judgment concerning the need for new rental units. Other considerations
will be FmHA's experience with the housing market in the State and local area and U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development's (HUD's) analysis of market feasibility for the proposed units. 


* * * * * 


F. The analyst must affirm that he/she actually made an on-site visit to the market area and that failure to do so may
result in denial of further participation in the section 515 program by the analyst.

will be prepared and submitted by all applicants. In addition to completing the individual line items, the cost of
items such as rights-of-way, equipment, and utility connections must be included and identified with the Form FmHA
1924-13. Off-site improvements and the method of prorating the cost between eligible and noneligible loan
items must be provided with the Form FmHA 1924-13. The cost breakdown must also separately show items not included
in the loan, such as furnishings, equipment, and the noneligible off-site improvements. The trade item cost breakdowns
must be updated just prior to loan approval.

24. Exhibit A-8 of subpart E is revised to read as follows: 



Exhibit A-8 of Subpart E_Outline of Professional Market Study 





Market studies which do not address all segments of this outline will not be considered acceptable and may adversely
affect the processing of preapplications. Preapplications with unacceptable market studies may be returned, deferred,
or rejected, as determined appropriate by the servicing office. 
The following information is to be used by analysts in the preparation of market studies for the Section 515 housing
program. It generally contains the type and depth of information which Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) requires
for evaluating the feasibility of prospective housing developments. The analyst will be expected to provide sufficient
quantitative data (such as census tables), primary data (such as survey of existing comparables), and qualitative
data (such as local contacts in the community) to support the conclusions reached. The analyst may present any other
discussions and/or data which will help support the complete analysis of the market. 
The outline provides for the demonstration of historical trends and allows the analyst to project into the 2 years
beyond the last actual year of record. Additional guidance is offered in individual segments of the outline. You will
need to provide a statement of your experience and why you think you are qualified to prepare such a study. 
Determination of need and demand will be derived for prospective rental tenants only from: (1) Persons migrating
into the area, (2) persons dwelling in family units who desire to move into their own units (elderly living with family
members will only be considered if evidence of their interest in moving into the project is furnished with the market
study), (3) conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households living in substandard rental housing,
(4) demolition of rental stock, (5) allowance for a 5 percent vacancy rate, and (6) conservative estimate (not to exceed
20 percent) of households experiencing rent overburden provided the analyst has made a determination there are sufficient
households in the market area to occupy any rental units vacated by those lower income persons who choose to move into
the proposed project from the existing units. Substandard is defined as (1) Units lacking complete plumbing and (2)
overcrowded (1.01 or more persons per room).

For proposed congregate projects, the analyst will be responsible for researching the current need for, and usage
of, services in the market area. The types of services being used, the provider of the services, and their location
will be included. 
Homeowners will not be included in the determination of need and demand for rental units.

 The analyst will discuss the current market for single family houses and how sales, or the lack of, will affect the demand
for elderly rental units. If the economic conditions reflect a trend toward normal selling times for houses in the
market area, then the discussion should point to how elderly homeowners may reinforce the need, but only as a secondary
market and not as the primary market. 
A statement, with signature, certifying that the analyst (including an individual under contract to the analyst's
company) actually traveled to and physically surveyed the community where the proposed project will be located is
also required. 


I. Market Area_General


The market area will be the community where the project will be located and only those outlying rural areas which will
be impacted by the project (excluding all other established communities). Except in specific cases of congregate
housing projects where an expanded market may be justified, the market area will not include the entire county (or
parish, township, or other subdivision). Any deviation from this definition must be coordinated with the servicing
office. The market area must be realistic. The criteria for selection should be described by the analyst. A map showing
the market area will be required. The following is an example of a market area description: 
A. Based on an analysis of population and housing development patterns, major employers and commuting patterns,
the effective market area for the subject proposal is defined to include all of (Name), 35 percent of (Name) and 25 percent
of (Name) census divisions. This area is shown on Map 2 following Table 4 (page 11) in Section II of this report. In 1980,
this geographic market area contained an estimated 6,350 persons (6.1 percent of the county total of 103,829 persons).
During the 1970's decade, the overall market area experienced growth of 1,253 persons (representing 13.5 percent
of total gains in the county). In 1990, the (Name) market area population of 7,603 represented 6.7 percent of the county
population of 113,086. (See Table 4 and Map 2 in Section II for details.) 
B. The effective market area for the subject proposal includes the town of (Name) and a portion of the unincorporated
areas to the east and south. The (Name) River forms a natural barrier restricting development to the west. Housing
development and population growth have occurred along major transportation corridors, particularly Interstate
81 and U.S. 11 between (Name) and (Name). Secondary growth has occurred along State Roads 63 and 68 to the northwest
and southeast of (Name). The Interstate Industrial Park, with 16 employers providing 999 jobs, is centrally located
within the market area. 
 


II. Site 


This section will contain a full description of the site, its position in the community and location with respect to
residential support services. 
A. The proposed site is located in the eastern section of (Town) on (Major Thoroughfare). The area surrounding the
site is predominantly comprised of modest single family dwellings. The terrain is gently sloped, with grass, oak
trees, and some shrubs. 
B. The site is currently zoned for commercial business and is currently owned by a local car dealer. 
C. The site is approximately .3 mile east of the heart of town which contains a grocery store, drugstore, restaurants,
banking facilities, the post office, and town hall. Other shopping is available .2 mile south at (Town) Plaza. 
D. The medical clinic, which provides services of an osteopath, X-ray technician, a physician's assistant, and a
nurse, is approximately .8 mile north of this site. This clinic is open daily and also provides 24-hour emergency service.
The nearest hospitals are (Large Town) and (Town).

E. All public services are available at the site. 

F. Photographs of the site are required. 

G. Communities suitable for multi-family projects may have certain smaller businesses necessary for the day-to-day
living convenience of the tenants and to supplement the employment base. For example, these may include, but not be
limited to, pharmacy, restaurants and fast food establishments, grocery and department stores, hardware and sundries,
etc. A representative number of these businesses are to be listed (by name) and location with respect to the proposed
site.

3. 

Major employers.

 This section will contain information pertinent to an analysis of the economic stability of the town. The major employers
within the town and market area, the product or service offered by each employer, location of employer, and year each
employer was established are types of data FmHA will need to evaluate. It is also important to know if the larger employers
intend to increase or decrease number of employees in the immediate future or if there have been any significant recent
changes in number of employees.

9. 

Households by income group. 

With the advent of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), we have found that more emphasis must be placed on analyzing
persons whose incomes qualify for LIHTC. This means families who earn 60 percent or less of the median income as established
by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Therefore, feasibility for projects expecting to
receive tax credits will also be based on the incomes required to support the tax credits. This could mean a level of
incomes either slightly lower or higher than FmHA very low-incomes. For those tax credit units occupied by low-income
families, the monthly gross rent cannot exceed 30 percent of the family income. Gross rent includes utilities, but
excludes payments of rental assistance by Federal, State, and local entities. The applicant will be responsible
for notifying FmHA and the market analyst of the amount of tax credits being requested, the income percentage on which
the credits will be based, and the percentage of project units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. In those cases
where less than 100 percent of the units will be designated for tax credit eligible persons, the incomes needed to support
the non-LIHTC units will need to be 
analyzed. Income data will be shown for total and renter households. This information will be presented as follows:
(It is recommended that decile distribution of incomes be obtained from HUD. Other sources are acceptable and must
be identified.)

2. 

Housing stock. 

The study must include the number of units within the town and county (where available), both single family and multi-family,
the number of mobile homes by tenure, along with the number of substandard units by tenure, based on the most recent
census data. Occasionally, a situation will exist within a community where a number of detached single family homes
are standing vacant. How this condition may affect the rental market must be evaluated and discussed.




Example: 


Inventory Change Profile 










3. 

Existing rental housing. 

The analyst must determine where the proposed project will fit into the present housing stock. To accomplish this,
the analyst will survey the existing units and will discuss how they (a) would be comparable with the proposed project
in overall appeal; (b) are less than desirable because of the age factor or upkeep; (c) are inconveniently located;
(d) do not provide the appropriate bedroom mix for the community need, etc. 

4. 

Details of existing stock. 

a. Additional narrative which describes the rental stock and provides tenant characteristics may be included. The
survey will include both subsidized and nonsubsidized rentals. In those communities containing too many rental
properties to list, all subsidized and a representative number of conventional projects will be included. Those
conventional projects which have rent levels comparable to the proposed project will be listed. Because elderly
persons may reside in family designated projects, the analyst will need to list all existing units and not just the
existing elderly units. Photographs of the comparables are required. 

b. The analyst will explore the availability of individual Section 8 certificates with the local housing authority
since they can be used on any project to bring the existing rents into an affordable range. For instance, 10 to 15 available
Section 8 certificates in a community could have an influence on the determination for new units and the number should
be reduced to correspond to this availability. However, before automatically reducing the number of proposed units
to match the number of available Section 8 units, the reason the certificates are available must be explored, (e.g.,
owners of non-Government subsidized units will not accept the certificates). (The bedroom sizes which the certificates
cover must match the prospective bedroom sizes in the proposed project bedroom mix.)

the analyst is expected to discuss the reasons for extended vacancies, either in individual developments or in the
community in general. The data needed are:

Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-215-1A10
series airplanes, that currently requires modification of the right aileron and aileron tab. That AD was prompted
by an updated flutter analysis performed by the manufacturer, which revealed a potential flutter condition on these
airplanes. The actions specified in that AD are intended to prevent potential flutter of the rudder-aileron interconnect
tab, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. This amendment revises the applicability of
the rule by adding additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 13, 1993, the FAA issued AD 
93-16-06, Amendment 39-8663 (58 FR 46766, September 3, 1993), applicable to certain Canadair Model
CL-215-1A10 series airplanes, to require installing weights to the aileron balance weight mounting
channel and installing washers to the interconnect tab mass balance arms. That modification will maintain an aileron
control surface mass balance within specified limits. That action was prompted by an updated flutter analysis, performed
by Canadair during the development of the Model CL-215-6B11 turboprop airplane, which revealed that
a potential flutter condition affecting the rudder-aileron interconnect tab could occur on certain Canadair Model
CL-215-1A10 series airplanes. (The Model CL-215-6B11 is a Model CL-215-1A10
that has been converted from piston engine power to turbopropeller power.) This flutter analysis further revealed
that, if the rudder-aileron interconnect mechanism fails, a flutter condition could occur at pressure altitudes
above 10,000 feet. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent potential flutter of the rudder-aileron
interconnect tab, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 


AD 93-16-06 is applicable only to Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes that are not
equipped with powered ailerons. Since issuance of that AD, however, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness
authority for Canada, has advised that additional airplanes may be subject to the same unsafe condition addressed
by the previous AD action. Further analysis has indicated that the flutter problems associated with the rudder-aileron
interconnect tab may occur on all Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes, including those equipped
with powered ailerons. 
Transport Canada Aviation revised Canadian AD CF-90-11, dated June 26, 1990, to require installation
of the aileron modification on all Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes, thereby assuring the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design, this AD is being issued to prevent potential flutter of the rudder-aileron interconnect tab, which could
result in reduced controllability of the airplane. This AD expands the applicability of the current rule to include
all Model 
CL-215-1A10 series airplanes. The requirements of the current rule remain unchanged. (The AD requires
modification of the right aileron and aileron tab.) 
There currently are no Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. All airplanes included
in the revised applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore,
they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that the revision to the applicability
of the rule is necessary to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes
are imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future. 
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
20 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this AD would be $1,100 per airplane. 
Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

<USDEPT>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>








National Archives at College Park, MD; Location of Records and Hours of Use 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Archives and Records Administration.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Archives and Records Administration is updating its regulations on location of records and hours of
use to add the National Archives at College Park (Archives II) facility which has opened in College Park, MD, and to
delete the Pickett Street facility in Alexandria, VA, which is no longer open for research. The rule is being issued
as an interim final rule so that the new facility hours will be established on the same date as the revised research room
hours in the National Archives Building. This rule will affect the public. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The National Archives at College Park research complex opened to the public on January 3, 1994. Records will continue
to be moved into the facility over the next two years as NARA completes a massive relocation of archival records from
its facilities in the Washington, DC, area. Upon completion of the move, NARA will operate two archival research facilities
in the Washington, DC, area: The National Archives Building and the National Archives at College Park, also known
as Archives II. The Pickett Street facility in Alexandria, VA, which housed the Nixon Presidential materials and
Cartographic research rooms, has closed; the Suitland Research Room will close for archival records research in
1996 when all archival records are relocated. 


NARA is adopting the National Archives Building Central Research Room and Microfilm Research Room hours at Archives
II. Uniform hours at the two facilities will allow adequate coverage in the research rooms. We considered selecting
different days for the Archives II complex to have extended hours; however, we concluded that such an action would
complicate staffing the research rooms during extended hours without providing significant benefit to most researchers.
With the allocation of records between the National Archives Building and Archives II based on grouping of related
records in one facility, most researchers will use either the National Archives Building or Archives II, but not both.

This rule is being issued as an interim final rule without prior notice of proposed rulemaking as permitted by the Administrative
Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon
are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. NARA finds that the public interest would be served
by early establishment of extended research room hours at the new Archives II facility. Because NARA wishes to establish
uniform hours for the Archives II research complex and the National Archives Building principal research rooms,
NARA was unable to begin the rulemaking process for the Archives II facility until its rulemaking amending research
room hours in the National Archives Building was completed. The final rule establishing hours for the National Archives
Building is published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

. 
NARA will issue a final rule confirming or amending the Archives II research complex hours at the close of the comment
period for this interim rule. 
This rule is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 and has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby
certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.

NARA Research Room Hours 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NARA is modifying the hours that the Central Research Room, the Microfilm Research Room, and the Motion Picture, Sound
and Video Research Room in the National Archives Building are open for research use. This rule affects researchers
who use these research rooms in the evening. NARA is taking this action so that resources will be available for staffing
the research rooms at the new National Archives at College Park (Archives II) facility. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NARA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49251) proposing that certain research
rooms in the National Archives Building that were open weekday evenings and on Saturday close at 8 p.m. instead of 10
p.m., Monday through Friday, and at 5 p.m. instead of 5:15 p.m. on Saturdays. Over 70 comments were received, most opposing
the proposed change. Many of these commenters noted that the reduction in evening hours would adversely impact local
researchers who conduct their research in the evening after their workday as well as visiting researchers who want
to maximize their research time in as short a period as possible and local evening classes who visit the National Archives
on night-time field trips. Commenters who use the Microfilm Research Room noted that the reduced hours would further
limit access to microfilm readers, for which there is frequently a waiting period. Several commenters offered alternative
research room schedules, such as a 9 p.m. weekday closing, later opening, or closing early on selected days of the week.



Commenters who favored the proposed change were primarily audiovisual archives researchers. Most of these commenters
stated that extending the research hours for still pictures, cartographic, electronic and Nixon holdings at the
National Archives at College Park facility (Archives II) would compensate for shortened hours in other research
rooms. 
After carefully considering all comments, NARA has developed a revised research room schedule that would accommodate
the concerns of the commenters and provide adequate staff coverage in the research rooms. NARA held a public meeting
on December 13, 1993, to discuss the comments received on the proposed rule and to solicit comments on the revised schedule.
Notice of the meeting was provided individually to each commenter and a notice of the meeting was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63133). Twenty-one persons, including members of the public and NARA staff, attended the
meeting. In addition, NARA received seven letters and three telephone calls from individuals who could not attend
the meeting. These comments were also considered in the preparation of this final rule. 
In this final rule, NARA is modifying research room hours in the Central Research Room and Microfilm Research Room
in the National Archives Building to be 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday and Wednesday; 8:45 a.m. to 9 p.m., Tuesday, Thursday,
and Friday; and 8:45 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., Saturday. The hours for the Motion Picture, Sound, and Video Research Room have
been deleted from this final rule because that research room will close for relocation to Archives II before the effective
date of this final rule. (That research room will be covered by a separate rulemaking on research room hours at Archives
II.) 
The days for 9 p.m. closing of the research rooms were chosen to include days when other research facilities, including
the Library of Congress, do not have evening hours. To further minimize the impact of the changed hours on researchers
in the Central and Microfilm Research Rooms, NARA will not invoke the 36 CFR 1254.12(a) provision that researchers
must return records up to 15 minutes before closing time in those research rooms. 
This rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 and
it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is
hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning procedural due process and appellate
rights. The change adds three exceptions to the general requirement that a pretermination/reduction notice must
be sent to a claimant prior to accomplishing an action adversely affecting benefit payments. The intended effects
of the change are to allow earlier adjudicative response in certain situations and to reduce the amount of potential
overpayments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.103(b)(3) in the 

Federal Register

 of July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38104-06). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before August
16, 1993. No comments were received, and the amendments are adopted as proposed. 



The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612.
The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. 

There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.

Order



In the matter of implementation of sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992_Rate
Regulation.





Adopted: 

February 8, 1994.





Released: 

February 8, 1994.






By the Commission: Commissioner Barrett issuing a separate statement.




I. Introduction




1. In this Order, on our own motion, we reconsider the expiration date of the freeze of regulated cable service revenues,
and extend the expiration date of the freeze from February 15, 1994 until May 15, 1994. Later this month, the Commission
will consider pending petitions to reconsider various aspects of its rate regulations. In considering the petitions
for reconsideration and other issues outstanding in the rate regulation proceedings, the Commission will address,
among other issues, the benchmark/price cap methodology, relief for small systems and so-called ``going forward
issues.'' The Commission also plans to adopt cost of service rules. This short extension of the freeze is the minimum
amount of time required to enable affected parties to familiarize themselves with any modifications to the cable
rate regulations before the freeze is lifted.






II. Background






2. In the Rate Order issued in May 1993, we established a comprehensive regulatory framework providing for rate regulation
of the basic service tier by local franchising authorities and of cable programming services tiers by the Commission
as required under the Cable Act of 1992. We established June 21, 1993 as the effective date of our new rate regulations.
At the same time, we were concerned that during the period between adoption of our rules and the earliest practical
opportunity for local franchising authorities to establish regulation of the basic service tier, and for consumers
to file complaints with the Commission concerning rates for cable programming services tiers, cable operators could
raise rates, effectively undermining the statutory mandate that rates for cable services remain reasonable. In
particular, we were concerned that cable operators could raise rates to potentially unreasonable levels, as determined
under the rate regulations ultimately adopted. We determined that a freeze of regulated cable service revenues until
August 3, 1993 would provide a reasonable opportunity for local franchise authorities to become certified to regulate
the basic service tier and for consumers to invoke by complaint the Commission's regulatory oversight over cable
programming services tiers. Accordingly, we established a freeze until that date of revenues for cable services
subject to regulation under the Cable Act of 1992. Under the freeze, the average monthly subscriber bill for cable
services and associated equipment subject to rate regulation under the Cable Act of 1992 may not increase above the
level determined under rates in effect on April 5, 1993. The Commission provided for waivers of the rate freeze in particular
cases where a cable operator can demonstrate that the freeze would impose severe economic hardship or threaten the
viability of continued cable service.

3. Subsequently, the Commission reexamined the feasibility of implementing rate regulation by June 21, 1993 in view
of the significant additional responsibilities imposed on the Commission by the Cable Act of 1992 and a severe funding
shortfall faced by the Commission at that time. We extended the freeze until November 15, 1993. Our regulations establishing
rate regulation of cable service became effective September 1, 1993. However, those regulations were subject to
reconsideration. Because the rate regulations were pending reconsideration, by early November, 1993, the Commission
had received applications for certification from local franchising authorities representing less than 20 percent
of communities that may regulate the basic service tier. Accordingly, on November 10, 1993, the Commission further
extended the freeze on regulated revenues until February 15, 1994. We stated that, where local governments already
have initiated rate regulation of the basic tier, we were not concerned that rates for the tier could raise to unreasonable
levels after November 15, 1993. We noted that in the initial freeze order, we determined that a freeze on rates for the
cable programming services tier was necessary to prevent operators from evading the freeze by moving programming
from the basic to the cable programming service tier. We concluded in the Nov. 10 Extension Order that it was unnecessary
to continue the freeze for cable programming service tiers where the basic tier has become subject to rate regulation.
Accordingly, we amended the rule to make clear that the freeze would no longer apply to regulated cable services provided
by cable operators whose basic cable service has become subject to rate regulation by a local franchising authority
or the Commission. As a result, the number of cable systems subject to the freeze decreases as franchising authorities
become certified.


III. Discussion


4. As of January 31, 1994, the Commission had received 4,896 applications for certification from local franchising
authorities covering approximately 7,534 communities served by cable. Although these figures for certifications
are significant increases from the last time we extended the freeze, they still represent only a small percentage
of the nearly 30,000 communities that are potentially eligible to regulate the basic service tier. We continue to
believe that it is important to provide franchising authorities and other affected parties sufficient time to become
familiar with any modifications to our rate regulations before the freeze is lifted. We expect to act on reconsideration
by the end of this month, and we believe that it is important that the statutory goal of ensuring reasonable rates not
be undermined in the interim.
5. The Administrative Procedure Act requires that new substantive rules be published in the 

Federal Register

 at least 30 days prior to their effective date. In the event that we adopt any substantive changes to our rules on reconsideration,
we anticipate that such revised rules would be released approximately 30 days after adoption and that these regulations
would be published in the 

Federal Register

 within 15 days thereafter. In addition, we will be adopting rules addressing issues raised in the Third Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking, 58 FR 46737 (Sep. 2, 1993). Thus, under this schedule, any new regulations adopted would become effective
approximately 75 days after adoption. Extension of the freeze for that period of time is the minimum amount of time
required to enable the Commission to adopt modified rules, should it choose to do so, and for such rules to become effective
before the freeze is lifted.

6. We believe that this brief extension of the freeze will ensure that local regulators have been afforded a sufficient
opportunity to file for certification and prepare for rate regulation under any modified rules that may be adopted.
This extension should provide sufficient time for local regulators to become familiar with their rights and obligations
under any such new regulations before cable operators are free to raise rates absent regulation. We emphasize that
we will continue to provide cable operators the opportunity to file petitions for relief which demonstrate, in individual
cases, that the freeze is causing severe economic hardship or threatens the viability of continued provision of cable
service. Throughout the duration of the rate freeze, we have received only five such petitions for relief. Thus, we
conclude that only a small percentage of cable operators believe that the freeze has imposed hardship sufficient
to compel them to seek relief from the freeze.

7. We also note that the Commission has acted expeditiously in addressing petitions for reconsideration of its rate
regulation rules. In adopting rate regulations for the cable television industry, the Commission recognized that
the rules would require further refinement based on survey data of the cable television industry to be gathered and
analyzed by the Commission. Shortly after the new rules became effective, the Commission conducted a survey to collect
the data necessary to help it assess the rate regulations. The Commission has analyzed this survey data and is now in
a position to resolve the pending petitions for reconsideration by the end of this month. In addition to analyzing
the survey data during the period since adoption of the rate rules, the Commission has accommodated the requests of
numerous cable operators, franchise authorities, programmers and many other interested parties, to meet with the
Commission's new Chairman, who assumed office on November 29, 1993, for the purpose of expressing their views on the
issues which the Commission will address on reconsideration of the rate rules.

8. We find good cause under the Administrative Procedure Act to make this freeze effective with less than 30 days advance
publication in the 

Federal Register

. As explained, an extension of the freeze from February 15, 1994 until May 15, 1994 is necessary to afford local franchising
authorities a sufficient period in which to familiarize themselves with any revised regulations governing regulated
cable service rates that the Commission may adopt on reconsideration later this month. We will make this

I. Introduction


Manufacturers typically comply with the parking brake requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.
121, 

Air Brake Systems

, by equipping their air-braked vehicles with spring brake systems. With these brake systems, air pressure holds
the spring in the released position when a vehicle is being driven. Upon parking, the air pressure is vented, allowing
the springs to apply the parking brakes. Consistent with NHTSA's policy to issue Federal safety standards that are
not unnecessarily design restrictive, the agency has conducted a number of rulemakings to ensure that the standard
does not unnecessarily prevent the manufacture of parking brake systems other than conventional spring brake systems
(e.g., air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems). See 44 FR 46850, August 9, 1979; 51 FR 10641, March
28, 1986; 56 FR 26927, June 12, 1991.
In 1992, International Transquip Industries, Inc. (ITI), a manufacturer of an air-applied, mechanically held parking
brake system, informed NHTSA that it believed two of Standard No. 121's current requirements are unnecessarily design
restrictive or otherwise inappropriate for its brake system design. One of these requirements specifies that a vehicle
must meet parking brake grade holding requirements on a 20 percent grade (or other equivalent requirements), with
``any single leakage-type failure'' of certain parts, including a failed diaphragm. See S5.6 of Standard No. 121.
ITI argued that this requirement is unnecessarily restrictive with respect to its air-applied, mechanically held
single diaphragm brake system. That company argued that its brake system is designed so that the diaphragm will never
experience a major failure, and that vehicles equipped with its brake system can be parked on a 20 percent grade in the
presence of the types of diaphragm failures that typically occur.
The other requirement that ITI believed is inappropriate for its brake design is the supply line pressure requirement
for trailers. See S5.8.2. This requirement addresses brake drag. According to ITI, it is inappropriate for its brake
system, which is designed so that its brakes are either fully applied or fully released.


II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Comments on the Proposal


After considering ITI's arguments, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed certain changes
to Standard No. 121. (58 FR 13437, March 11, 1993). Specifically, the agency proposed to amend the requirements related
to the application and holding of parking brake systems and the requirements related to the supply line pressure retention
for trailer brakes. In that notice, the agency tentatively concluded that these amendments would remove unnecessary
restrictions, thus facilitating the use of air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems. The agency further
explained that the Standard should not unnecessarily prevent parking brake systems that are different than conventional
spring brake systems. The agency believed that this proposal would provide regulatory relief by removing a restriction
affecting the use of non-spring brake systems, while continuing to ensure appropriate grade holding performance
of air braked heavy vehicles.
NHTSA received twelve comments on the proposal. Among the commenters were ITI, which commented twice; the Motor Equipment
Manufacturers Association (MEMA), a trade association that represents heavy duty brake manufacturers; spring
brake manufacturers and spring brake rebuilders, including Midland-Grau, MGM Brakes, Neway Anchorlok, Allied
Signal, TSE Brakes, and Ferodo America; heavy vehicle manufacturers including GM/Volvo White and Freightliner;
and the American Trucking Associations (ATA). There was no consensus among the commenters about whether the proposal
should be adopted. While ITI favored the proposal which it believed would eliminate an unnecessary design restriction,
the manufacturers of spring brake systems opposed it. The spring brake manufacturers would experience increased
competition from the additional use of air-applied, mechanically held systems, which, according to ITI currently
represent 2 percent of the air brake chamber market. The ITI system would provide weight savings but would cost an additional
$28 more per axle than spring brake chambers. The spring brake manufacturers argued that the proposal poses significant
safety problems since they believe that brake diaphragms can and do experience rapid catastrophic failures. The
commenters also addressed specific issues about the proposed test procedure for air-applied, mechanically held
parking brake systems and the need to retain the supply line pressure requirement for vehicles equipped with these
systems. The agency has analyzed the comments and responds to the significant ones below.


III. Agency Decision


A. Grade Holding Requirements


1. Background Considerations


Standard No. 121 currently requires an air-braked vehicle to have a parking brake system that enables it to meet certain
grade holding requirements. Manufacturers have the option of complying with either a 20 percent grade holding test
or an equivalent static drawbar pull test. The purpose of the parking brake requirement is to ensure that an air-braked
vehicle has adequate parking brake performance on a grade.

<TEXT>
 

The standard provides that the parking brake grade holding requirements must be met with ``any'' single leakage-type
failure of certain parts, including service brake diaphragms. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that a driver
can safely park a vehicle in the event of a leakage-type failure in the service brake system. The standard specifies
``any'' failure because leakage-type failures of many types, sizes, and locations can occur in vehicle brake systems.
To ensure that a vehicle has adequate grade holding performance regardless of the specific nature or extent of a leakage-type
failure, the agency intentionally did not limit the size or location of such failures.
In the NPRM, NHTSA explained that most brake systems are designed with two diaphragms, one for the service brake function
and one for the parking brake function. Further, most brake systems incorporate a spring brake for parking. These
brake systems can easily meet the parking brake holding requirements with a failure in the service brake diaphragm,
because a failure in that diaphragm does not adversely affect parking brake performance. In contrast, the ITI air-applied,
mechanically held brake system has only one diaphragm that provides both the parking brake and service brake functions.
A hole in that diaphragm can therefore affect both parking brake and service brake performance.
According to ITI, it is inappropriate to require vehicles to meet grade holding requirements with ``any'' failure
in the common diaphragm of its brake system, because its system is designed so that a hole in the diaphragm with not get
any larger than 1/8 inch during real-world use. ITI further stated that a vehicle equipped with its brake system will
hold on a 20 percent grade and can never be driven with a failure larger than 1/8 inch. This is because, according to ITI,
diaphragm failures begin as very small holes, develop very slowly, and its brakes will not release once the hole gets
larger than 1/8 inch. Thus, once a hole gets that large and the driver parks the vehicle at the end of the day, it will not
be possible to drive the vehicle without repairing the brakes.
As explained in the NPRM, NHTSA evaluated the issues raised by ITI through tests of the air-applied, mechanically
held system conducted at the agency's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC). (See, Evaluation of Mini-Max Parking
Forces with Chamber Diaphragm Failures, December 17, 1992, which has been placed in Docket No. 93-17, Notice
1.) That testing confirmed that vehicles equipped with the ITI system could not be unparked in the presence of a relatively
small failure.
In the NPRM, NHTSA sought comment on two primary issues related to air-applied, mechanically held brake systems:
(1) Whether the current requirement is appropriate for an air-applied, mechanically held brake system like ITI's
system and (2) whether it is possible to develop a test procedure that will identify the ``worst case'' diaphragm failure
that might be experienced in the real world.


2. Diaphragm Failure Modes


In the NPRM, NHTSA discussed whether air-applied, mechanically held brake systems only experience small, gradual
failures or whether they can experience catastrophic failures.
 If diaphragms do in fact experience catastrophic failures, then the proposed requirement would not ensure the safety
of air-braked vehicles. However, based on information provided by ITI and the agency's analysis of that information,
NHTSA assumed, for purposes of this rulemaking, that diaphragm failures begin small and develop very slowly. Accordingly,
the proposed test procedure was designed to evaluate the small, gradual leakage-type failures that, according to
ITI, occur with its system. Notwithstanding NHTSA's decision to propose requirements that would be appropriate
only if diaphragms only experience small, gradual leakage-type failures, the agency sought comment about whether
catastrophic diaphragm failures occur in the real world.

The commenters expressed conflicting views about the nature of diaphragm failures. On the one hand, ITI reiterated
its view that diaphragm failures begin small and develop very slowly because the diaphragms use a rip stop nylon fabric.
This led ITI to conclude that long before a hole becomes large enough to affect parking capabilities, it is no longer
possible to release the parking brakes. ITI accordingly requested that diaphragms be excluded from failure testing.
On the other hand, the spring brake manufacturers (Midland-Grau, MGM Brakes, Neway Anchorlok, Allied Signal, MEMA,
and Ferodo) stated that diaphragms can and do experience rapid massive failure in addition to the gradual failure
discussed by ITI. The spring brake manufacturers alleged that there were several catastrophic failure modes, including:
(1) The piston plate wearing a hole through the diaphragm, (2) air permeating between the rubber or neoprene compound
causing it to balloon out and then blow, (3) the effects of exposing the diaphragm to oil which causes the compound to
delaminate from the fabric, (4) broken springs or piston plates cutting into the diaphragm, (5) and manufacturing
defects in the nylon fabric. Neway Anchorlok believed that because these catastrophic failure modes can occur between
parking brake applications, they may significantly and suddenly impair the service brake's capabilities. The potential
for catastrophic failures led the spring brake manufacturers to recommend that the agency retain the ``any leakage''
requirements. 

After reviewing the conflicting comments, NHTSA decided to examine further the failure modes experienced by diaphragms.
To this end, the agency visually inspected failed diaphragms submitted by Bendix, Ferodo, and MGM. In addition, the
agency contacted diaphragm manufacturers. In its examination of diaphragms submitted by various manufacturers,
NHTSA found no evidence of catastrophic failure; rather, the agency found that failures typically involved slow
deterioration through extended use. The only time the agency found a catastrophic failure was when there was a rapid
air loss resulting from a spring puncture or a pull-out from the clamp band area. Spring puncture failures are not relevant
to the present rulemaking about air-applied, mechanically held systems which do not have springs. With respect to
possible pull-out, ITI has stated that if, in servicing its units, the diaphragm is installed improperly, the brakes
cannot be released upon air-up of the system. The agency has placed the findings of its inspection of failed diaphragms
in the docket. 

In response to agency inquiries, Longwood Elastomers and Goodyear, two large diaphragm manufacturers, stated that
diaphragms do not fail catastrophically. While they acknowledge that some failure modes mentioned by the spring
brake manufacturers do occur (e.g., spring puncture, plate chaff, unseating, flex cracking in the bead area, accelerated
degradation caused by exposure to oil), they contended that such failures either happen so infrequently that they
do not raise safety concerns or would not happen with an air-applied, mechanically held brake system (e.g., a single
diaphragm brake system has no heavy spring brake that can pierce the diaphragm after failing from fatigue). With respect
to failure rates, one diaphragm manufacturer informed the agency that it had returns of about 20 units from an annual
production of between 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 units. This failure rate translates to a reliability of about 99.999
percent. These reliability figures are for the useful lifecycle before wearout begins. All diaphragms would eventually
wear out. Therefore, diaphragms in air-applied, mechanically held systems and in the service side of spring brake
systems are typically replaced after between four and five years of service. The diaphragm manufacturers further
stated that they have never encountered a catastrophic failure during cycle testing of their production runs.

Based on NHTSA's review of the failed diaphragms, contacts with diaphragm manufacturers and other available information,
the agency has concluded that diaphragms used with air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems do not fail
catastrophically. Rather, the typical failure mode with these systems is a gradual deterioration through extended
use. The agency further notes that GM/Volvo White and Freightliner, which use ITI air brake chambers as original equipment
on their vehicles when ordered by a customer, have not experienced any catastrophic failures with these systems.
Accordingly, the agency concludes that the current requirement to require vehicles to meet the parking brake requirements
with ``any'' single leakage type failure is unnecessarily design-restrictive with respect to air-applied, mechanically
held air brake systems. 

ITI requested that NHTSA exclude diaphragms entirely from failure testing with respect to the parking brake requirements.
However, NHTSA has decided that an exclusion would be inappropriate. A diaphragm is an integral part of the parking
brake system, and the failure of a diaphragm can have adverse safety consequences. Therefore, excluding diaphragms
from such testing would be inconsistent with the safety purposes of the standard. Such an exclusion would be inconsistent
with the underlying purpose of the parking brake requirements which serve to ensure that a driver can safely park a
vehicle in the event of a leakage-type failure in the service brake system. Because diaphragms do fail, as ITI readily
admits, it would be inconsistent with the parking brake requirements to exclude such an important component in the
brake system from the relevant test requirements. 



3. Test Procedure



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed a test procedure that it tentatively concluded would identify the ``worst case'' leakage-type
diaphragm failure that is likely to occur with brake systems using common diaphragms. Under the proposed procedure,
the first step would be to determine the threshold level of diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of
leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable.
A measurement would then be taken of the leakage rate associated with that level of failure. The proposal explained
that the ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' is the rate of reservoir air pressure decrease, for whichever
of the vehicle's reservoirs that is experiencing the most rapid decrease in pressure level, that results from that
threshold level of leakage. The agency proposed that a vehicle would be required to meet grade holding requirements
with a level of diaphragm leakage-type failure that results in a reservoir leakage rate that is three times the threshold
maximum reservoir leakage rate. This ``three times'' safety factor was included to account for the possibility that
a small diaphragm failure could grow larger between parking brake applications. 

Midland-Grau, ITI, and Allied Signal believed that the proposed test procedure was unnecessarily complex. Midland-Grau
stated that the procedures were difficult to follow and could be interpreted in many ways. Midland-Grau requested
that NHTSA modify the test procedure so that it could be easily followed. Moreover, it stated its preference for testing
parameters that are concise, and lead to consistent test results that allow easy assessment of whether the system
passes or fails. ITI requested that the agency simplify the test to make it less complicated. Allied Signal criticized
the proposal for being overly complex, claiming that multiple attempts would be necessary to establish the size of
diaphragm failure for both release and application. 

After reviewing the proposal in light of the comments, NHTSA believes that the proposed test procedure, with minor
adjustments, is appropriate to evaluate brake systems that incorporate a common diaphragm. The agency further believes
that the test procedure is not unreasonably complicated. In particular, the agency's experience at VRTC in running
the tests indicates that the tests are not overly burdensome and that with a valving meter in place, various pressure
levels of leakage can be obtained relatively quickly and without much difficulty. The agency notes that to simplify
testing, it could have specified a fixed orifice size to be used for all systems. However, such an approach would have
prevented certain parking brake systems and thus have been unnecessarily design restrictive, since the size of leak
at which sufficient force is generated to park the vehicle varies for different systems. In contrast, the variable
leak rate procedure that the agency is adopting in this final rule may be used to evaluate any brake system regardless
of its design.

<TEXT>
 

In response to specific comments and further analysis of the regulatory text, NHTSA has made some minor changes to
the proposed test procedures applicable to air-applied, mechanically held brake systems. For instance, in response
to criticisms by Midland-Grau of terminology that it believed was ambiguous, NHTSA has deleted reference to ``certain
level'' of failure as proposed in S5.6(b). In addition, as explained below, the agency has modified the terminology
related to the concept of parking brake ``release.''

Nevertheless, NHTSA has decided to retain the following terms that Midland-Grau criticized: ``Increasing or decreasing,''
``threshold level of diaphragm leakage,'' ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage associated with that level of
failure,'' and ``threshold of allowable leakage.'' With respect to finding the leakage rate at which the parking
brake system becomes unreleasable, the agency believes it is necessary for the test evaluator to find the appropriate
threshold level with ``progressively increasing or decreasing levels'' of failure because each brake configuration
is different. While this procedure will require some searching for the leakage rate at which the system becomes unreleasable,
the agency believes the appropriate level of failure can be ascertained without too much difficulty by using metering
valves. NHTSA notes that in VRTC's testing to develop this rule's requirements and procedures, the agency installed
an adjustable metering valve in the brake chamber housing to simulate a leak in the brake chamber diaphragm. The ``threshold
level of common diaphragm leakage type failure'' at which the parking brakes become unreleasable was determined
by increasing the leakage rate, by ``opening'' the metering valve, from one test to the next in relatively large increments
until the parking brakes would not release. Then, the metering valve was ``closed,'' to decrease the leakage rate,
in smaller increments until the parking brakes would release. The leakage rate was then increased by even smaller
increments until the parking brakes were again unreleasable. The precision with which the final determination of
the ``threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' at which the parking brakes become unreleasable
is determined by the number of times the direction of leakage rate change, e.g., from increasing to decreasing and
vice versa, and the magnitude of the increments by which the leakage rate is increased or decreased.

With respect to various references to the concept of the ``threshold,'' the agency has modified these provisions
slightly to use just two terms: ``Threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' in S5.6.7.1.1 and S5.6.7.2.1
and the ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' in S5.6.7.1.2 and S5.6.7.2.2. NHTSA, nevertheless, disagrees
with Midland-Grau's more general concern that the term ``threshold'' is ambiguous. The agency notes that the dictionary
defines ``threshold'' to mean ``a level, point, or value above which something is true or will take place and below
which it is not or will not.''
 Applying this definition to the parking brake test for systems with common diaphragms, the agency believes that ``threshold
level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' is an objective term that means the initial level at which the parking
brake can no longer be released. Similarly, the meaning of the phrase ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate''
was discussed in the NPRM and means the rate of reservoir air pressure decrease that results at that threshold level
of leakage.





With respect to the concept of ``release,'' NHTSA has decided to clarify the term so that it covers brake applications
that involve a vehicle being parked on a grade or a drawbar pull test. NHTSA notes that in addressing a similar issue
in an earlier rulemaking about what was meant by ``release,'' the agency stated that ``NHTSA considers a brake to be
released at the point where it no longer exerts any torque.'' (37 FR 12495, June 24, 1972). The agency believes that
this discussion of release is pertinent to the procedure set forth in S5.6(b). Accordingly, in the final rule, the
agency has specified that the relevant consideration is when the parking brakes ``become unreleasable.'' Since
the final rule specifies the criteria in terms of ``becom(ing) unreleasable,'' Midland-Grau's concerns about when
the released condition exists or about the status of a partial release are no longer relevant.

<TEXT>
 

Midland-Grau requested that the agency provide an acceptable leakage value for each brake component. It further
stated that statements about ``compressor shut-off points'' and ``air flow'' should be pinned down to definitive
values.
NHTSA disagrees with Midland-Grau's request to provide a specific level of leakage for each brake component. The
agency's goal in this rulemaking is to establish a performance test for the entire brake system, because the agency's
concern is to test for and prohibit system-wide failures that may pose safety problems. The agency therefore is not
concerned with the leakage level of any particular component. Nor does the agency believe it is necessary or appropriate
to specify definitive values for the compressor shut-off points. Such an action might be unnecessarily design restrictive
and serve to prohibit some manufacturers from selecting a higher cut off value than would be appropriate for its system.
Allied and Midland-Grau expressed concern that the rate of reservoir pressure drop is influenced by valving, plumbing,
and air supply capability. NHTSA acknowledges that these variables exist; however, the agency believes that they
are not large enough to adversely affect the test results. Specifically, as long as testing is done at three times the
leak rate, the actual numerical value of the leak rate is not overly important, because the value for the safety factor
is measured in the same way, which results in factoring out most of the variability. The agency further notes that these
variables are part of the manufacturing process and thus, if necessary, they can be controlled by the brake system
manufacturer. Moreover, alternative methods of testing would have necessitated using expensive flow meters that
would not significantly reduce the level of variability or otherwise improve the test results. NHTSA notes that while
the rate of air flow through the system may be affected by slight variations in air hose lengths from vehicle to vehicle,
internal size variations in the castings used in the hose fittings, and differences in valve tolerances; the leak
rates at issue are not sufficiently large to be significantly affected by this type of variability from vehicle to
vehicle. Internal drag on air flow does not become a factor until the flow rates become substantially higher than those
being measured here.
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a vehicle would be required to meet grade holding requirements with the level of diaphragm
leakage failure of three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate. The agency reasoned that a safety factor
was necessary to address the situation when a small diaphragm failure grows larger between parking brake applications,
prior to the time the vehicle is parked (at which point the parking brakes would be unreleasable.
Midland-Grau, ITI, and Allied objected to including a safety factor ``three times the threshold maximum reservoir
leakage.'' Midland-Grau stated that the rationale for this test is not easily visualized and is questionable as to
why it was selected as a test parameter. ITI stated that the safety factor should be eliminated to avoid additional
time and cost in compliance testing. Allied stated that it was not aware of any information or data that the agency used
to establish the three times reservoir pressure drop rate as being a ``worst case'' type of failure for a brake chamber
diaphragm.
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that it is necessary to include a safety factor in the application
and holding requirements for air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems. The agency notes that including
the provision for grade holding at ``three times the failure rate'' is essential to ensure the brake system's safety
since the hole associated with a diaphragm failure grows larger during the day. In addition, including a safety factor
serves to prevent marginal systems from being manufactured. The agency selected a safety factor of three based on
general engineering principles and the agency's testing at VRTC. In general, a safety factor needs to be as large as
possible to ensure safety, while not be too large to make it unreasonable, impracticable, and unaffordable. In agency
tests at VRTC, NHTSA determined that the ITI system would still produce sufficient parking force with a diaphragm
leak over ten times larger than the system would detect and still not release the parking brakes. Based on its understanding
of diaphragm failures associated with air-applied, mechanically held braking systems, NHTSA determined that a
safety factor of three was the most appropriate level of safety for inclusion in a FMVSS. The agency believes that this
level of safety will not require manufacturers to ``over-design'' their parking brake systems, but will ensure appropriate
brake system performance. NHTSA disagrees with ITI's comment that inclusion of a safety factor would add needless
complexity to the requirement. Agency testing at VRTC indicates that inclusion of a safety factor will not significantly
add to the time and cost of compliance testing. Essentially, as a result of the safety factor, a test evaluator needs
to establish the threshold value for the maximum reservoir leakage rate and then triple it. Based on its experience
at VRTC, the agency believes that this will add only five to ten minutes to the compliance testing (at only nominal additional
cost.)

B. Supply Line Pressure Requirements for Trailers 



Section S5.8.2 of Standard No. 121 currently requires that any single leakage type failure in the service brake system
must not result in the pressure in the supply line falling below 70 p.s.i., measured at the forward trailer supply coupling.
(See 56 FR 50666, October 8, 1991). The purpose of this provision is to prevent brake drag caused by the automatic application
of trailer parking brakes while the minimum trailer supply line pressure is maintained. 

In a June 5, 1992 letter to the agency, ITI requested that the agency ``exempt'' its brake system from S5.8.2. It argued
that this provision relates to problems caused by brake drag, a situation that it contends is not applicable to ITI's
brake system, which, by design, can only be in the fully applied or fully released positions. 

After considering ITI's arguments, NHTSA, in the NPRM, tentatively concluded that no safety purpose would be served
to apply this provision to non-towing trailers using air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes that use a common
diaphragm. The agency noted that these vehicles do not use spring brakes and thus the requirement which addresses
the safety problem of brake drag is not relevant to them. Accordingly, the agency proposed to amend section S5.8.2
to clarify that this provision would not apply to non-towing trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held
parking brakes that use a common diaphragm. Nevertheless, NHTSA emphasized that section S5.8.2 would continue to
apply to towing trailers, since the 70 psi requirements may be necessary for other vehicles in the train.


Midland-Grau, ITI, ATA, and Allied Signal addressed the issue of whether the 70 psi supply line pressure requirement
should be retained for trailers, particularly towing trailers, equipped with air-applied, mechanically held parking
brakes. Midland-Grau stated that making the 70 psi requirement optional for towing trailers with air-applied mechanically
hold brake systems introduces a detriment to the couple vehicles in the event of system failure. This led Midland-Grau
to conclude that it is necessary to apply failure. This led Midland-Grau to conclude that it is necessary to apply the
supply line pressure requirements to trailers since a towing trailer will experience brake degradation if it is not
properly protected from towed trailer system failures. 

In contrast, ITI stated that this requirement should not be applied to either towing or non-towing vehicles equipped
with air-applied, mechanically held vehicles since they do not experience brake drag. This led ITI to state that S5.8.4
was not necessary, because it claimed that partial application or brake drag is not an issue with its brake systems.
Thus, it requested that towing trailers with air-applied, mechanically held systems be permitted without the 70
psi supply line protection feature, even though it acknowledge that this may result in some mismatches. In response
to Midland-Grau's comment, ITI stated that trailers equipped with spring brakes manufactured before and after the
October 1992 rule that specified these requirements (56 FR 50666, October 8, 1991) will experience compatibility
problems. Therefore, ITI believed that the problem raised by Midland-Grau will exist with spring brake equipped
trailers as well as trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held equipped trailers. 

ATA commented that the existing 70 psi supply line requirement is inappropriate and prevents tractor low air pressure
warning systems from warning drivers of the loss of service pressure in trailers. Therefore, it requested that the
agency either exempt all trailers from the 70 psi supply line requirement or modify the requirement. Allied Signal
similarly stated that the 70 psi requirement has undermined the effectiveness of the low pressure warning system,
especially for doubles and triples. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to apply the supply lone pressure requirements to single trailers
equipped with air-applied, mechanically held brake systems. Such trailers, which do not experience brake drag,
also do not affect the braking of any other vehicle because they are not connected to other trailers. Therefore, as
discussed in the NPRM, this requirement would not benefit this type of trailer.

Nevertheless, the agency has decided that the supply line pressure requirements are relevant to air-applied, mechanically
held brake systems on towing trailers used in double and triple trailer combinations.
 The agency is not convinced by ITI's argument that trailers equipped with their system should not have to comply with
the 70 psi requirement because there are older spring brake-equipped trailers that will pose similar compatibility
problems. The agency believes that there would be a safety problem if it were to apply the supply line pressure requirements
to certain vehicles in double or triple combinations but not others. Specifically, if ITI's request were adopted,
a trailer being towed by a trailer equipped with air-applied, mechanically held brakes would not necessarily receive
adequate air pressure and therefore could experience brake drag. The agency's decision to apply these requirements
to towing trailers is consistent with recent legislation and the efforts of the agency, manufacturers, and end-users
to standardize operating conditions to improve compatibility. Specifically, section 4012 of the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) directs the agency to initiate rulemaking to improve compatibility of truck
tractors, trailers, and their dollies. The agency further notes that a specialized trailer protection valve could
be developed for ITI's system that would permit compliance with the requirements of S5.8.2 and S5.8.3.





With respect to concerns expressed by ATA and Allied about the 70 psi supply line pressure requirement, NHTSA notes
that it is reviewing this provision in the context of a rulemaking petition submitted by the California Highway Patrol.
The agency anticipates issuing another notice addressing the supply line pressure requirements in 1994.



IV. Leadtime



Section 103(c) of the Vehicle Safety Act requires that each order shall take effect no sooner than 180 days from the
date the order is issued unless ``good cause'' is shown that an earlier effective date is in the public interest. NHTSA
has determined that there would be ``good cause'' not to provide the 180 day lead-in period given that this amendment
will not impose any mandatory requirements on manufacturers. The public interest will also be served by not delaying
the introduction of the requirement. Based on the above, the agency has determined that there is good cause to have
an effective date 30 days after publication in the final rule.



V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices



1. Executive Order 12688 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking and determined that it is neither ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department
of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures nor ``significant'' within the meaning of Executive Order
12688. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12688, ``Regulatory Planning, and Review.'' A full regulatory
evaluation is not required because the rule will have no mandatory effects. Rather, the rule will provide regulatory
relief to facilitate the introduction of alternative brake systems. Therefore, the agency does not believe that
this rulemaking will result in significant additional costs or cost savings.



2. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this action on small entities.
Based upon this evaluation, I certify that the amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Vehicle and brake manufacturers typically will not qualify as small entities. This amendment
will also affect small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units to the extent that these entities
purchase air-braked vehicles. As discussed above, the agency's assessment is that this amendment will have no significant
cost impact to the industry. For these reasons, vehicle manufacturers, small businesses, small organizations,
and small governmental units which purchase motor vehicles will not be significantly affected by the requirements.
Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.



3. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule will not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. No State laws will be affected.



4. National Environmental Policy Act



The agency has considered the environmental implications of this rule in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 and determined that the rule will not significantly affect the human environment.

5. Civil Justice Reform



This rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain
a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section
105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or
revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration
or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

S5.6.7 Maximum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure/Equivalent level of leakage from the air
chamber containing that diaphragm.

 In the case of vehicles for which the option in S5.6(b) has been elected, determine the maximum level of common diaphragm
leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) according
to the procedures set forth in S5.6.7.1 through S5.6.7.2.3. 

S5.6.7.1 

Trucks and buses.

S5.6.7.1.1 According to the following procedure, determine the threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking
brakes become unreleasable. With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application
of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch
test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or
equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm). Apply the parking brakes by making an application
actuation of the parking brake control. Reduce the pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero, turn on the
engine and allow it to idle, and allow the pressures in the vehicle's reservoirs to rise until they stabilize or until
the compressor shut-off point is reached. At that time, make a release actuation of the parking brake control, and
determine whether all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking
brake applications with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the minimum performance specified in either
S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever is applicable)
of leakage-type diaphragm failures or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-type
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which all of the mechanical
means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking
retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.

S5.6.7.1.2 At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the
air chamber containing that diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.1.1, and using the following procedure, determine
the threshold maximum reservoir rate (in psi per minute). With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the
engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped
with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application actuation
of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the
maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake application.

S5.6.7.1.3 Using the following procedure, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or
equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir leakage rate
that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate determined in S5.6.7.1.2. With an initial reservoir
system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle
is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling,
make an application actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi
per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after
that parking brake application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage
from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the level that is to
be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b).

S5.6.7.2 Trailers.
S5.6.7.2.1 According to the following procedure, determine the threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking
brakes become unreleasable. With an initial reservoir system and supply line pressure of 100 psi, no application
of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch
test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or
equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm). Make a parking brake application by venting
the front supply line coupling to the atmosphere, and reduce the pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero.
Pressurize the supply line by connecting the trailer's front supply line coupling to the supply line portion of the
trailer test rig (Figure 1) with the regulator of the trailer test rig set at 100 psi, and determine whether all of the
mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient
parking retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure
with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever is applicable) of leakage-type diaphragm failures
or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent
level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which all of the mechanical means referred to in
S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking retardation forces
to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.
S5.6.7.2.2 At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the
air chamber containing that diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.2.1, and using the following procedure, determine
the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi per minute). With an initial reservoir system and supply line
pressure of 100 psi, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped
with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply line coupling, make a parking brake application
by venting the front supply line coupling to the atmosphere. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi
per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after
that parking brake application.
S5.6.7.2.3 Using the following procedure, a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent
leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir leakage rate that is three
times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate determined in S5.6.7.2.2. With an initial reservoir system and
supply line pressure of 100 psi, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow
a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply line coupling, make
a parking brake application by venting the front supply line coupling to the atmosphere. Determine the maximum reservoir
leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs
that results after that parking brake application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent
level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the
level that is to be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b).


* * * * *


S5.8.2 Supply Line Pressure Retention. 

Any single leakage type failure in the service brake system (except for a failure of the supply line, a valve directly
connected to the supply line or a component of a brake chamber housing) shall not result in the pressure in the supply
line falling below 70 p.s.i., measured at the forward trailer supply coupling. A trailer shall meet the above supply
line pressure retention requirement with its brake system connected to the trailer test rig shown in Figure 1, with
the reservoirs of the trailer and test rig initially pressurized to 100 p.s.i. and the regulator of the trailer test
rig set at 100 p.s.i.; except that a trailer equipped with an air-applied, mechanically-held parking brake system
and not designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, at the manufacturer's option, may meet the requirements
of S5.8.4 rather than those of S5.8.2 and S5.8.3.


* * * * *


S5.8.4 

Automatic Application of Air-Applied, Mechanically Held Parking Brakes. 

With its brake system connected to the supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) and the regulator of the
trailer test rig set at 100 psi, and with any single leakage type failure in the service brake system (except for a failure
of the supply line, a valve directly connected to the supply line or a component of a brake chamber, but including failure
of any common diaphragm), the parking brakes shall not provide any brake retardation as a result of complete or partial
automatic application of the parking brakes.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Closure.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 62 in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary
to prevent exceeding the interim specification for pollock in this area.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.




The interim specification of pollock in Statistical Area 62 was established by interim specifications (58 FR 60575,
November 17, 1993) as 4,563 metric tons (mt), determined in accordance with  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A).

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 interim specification of pollock in Statistical Area 62 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 4,163 mt, and has set aside the remaining 400 mt as bycatch to support other
anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 62, effective
from 12 noon, A.l.t., February 9, 1994, until the second quarter's allowance becomes available.

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  672.20(g).

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

1994 initial quota for crustaceans; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS announces a 1994 initial quota of 200,000 lobsters for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) crustacean
fishery. The quota was calculated according to the formula contained in Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan
for the Crustacean Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The final quota for the 1994 fishing year, which
begins July 1, 1994, will be announced after the first month of fishing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The crustacean fisheries of the NWHI are managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP, which
was prepared by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations affecting the U.S. fishery are at 50 CFR part 681.




The annual quota for the crustacean fishery is announced in two steps. First, based on previous years' fishery data,
sampling during research cruises, and other available data, the Regional Director determines an initial quota,
which is announced in the 

Federal Register

 by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA. A population model by which the quota is determined is described
in Amendment 7 to the FMP. The final quota for the year is then determined based on actual commercial fisheries data
collected during the first month of fishing. This actual catch and effort data, in conjunction with the previous information,
provides a more reliable indicator of the status of the lobster stocks in the NWHI.

Amendment 7 provides that an annual quota be set at a level permitting an average catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of 1.0
for the fleet. In 1992, the initial quota was set at 750,000 lobsters, which was subsequently reduced to 438,000 lobsters
following an analysis of data obtained from the fishery. In 1993, there was no quota, and the fishery was closed for
the entire year.

The Regional Director has used the formula in Amendment 7 to set an initial quota for 1994 of 200,000 lobsters (spiny
and slipper lobsters combined). Data collected during NMFS survey cruises indicate that recruitment to the fishery
remained at about 840,000 lobsters during the 1992-93 period, and there were no removals of lobster by the fishery
in 1993; therefore, there is a net addition to the stock to support a fishery in 1994. The model projects a commercial
CPUE of 1.0 at the start of the fishing year with an initial quota of 200,000 lobsters. The final quota, to be announced
in the 

Federal Register

 as soon as practicable after August 15, 1994, may increase or decrease substantially from the initial quota. The Southwest
Region, NMFS, will monitor landings against the quota and issue timely reports of summary data. The Southwest Region
also will attempt to promptly notify participants in the fishery of any changes in the fishery; however, participants
are advised to contact the Southwest Region (see 

ADDRESSES

) periodically to stay of changes in the quota and progress of the fishery toward attaining the quota. Announcement
of a closure of the fishery due to reaching the quota will follow the procedures set forth in 50 CFR 681.31(c).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


On November 30, 1993, Public Law 103-159 (107 Stat. 1536) was enacted, 
amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended (18 
U.S.C. Chapter 44). Title I of Public Law 103-159, cited as 
the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act'' (hereinafter, 
``the Act''), provides for a national waiting period of 5 
days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer 
may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual 
(interim provision), and for the establishment of a national instant criminal background check system to 
be queried by firearms licensees before transferring any 
firearm to nonlicensed individuals (permanent provision). 
The permanent system will be effective on November 30, 
1998. Violations of either the interim or permanent 
provision are punishable by a fine or imprisonment for 
not more than 1 year, or both. 
Titles II and III of Public Law 103-159 relate to 
reporting requirements for multiple handgun sales, labeling 
of packages containing a firearm, thefts of firearms from 
licensed firearms dealers, and increased license fees for 
dealers in firearms. Regulations implementing these 
provisions are also part of this Treasury decision.

Waiting Period (Interim Provision) 


The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of 
the law become effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to 
apply on November 30, 1998. The Act imposes a waiting 
period of 5 business days (defined in the statute as days 
on which State offices are open) before a licensee may 
sell or deliver a handgun. As defined in the Act, the term 
``handgun'' means_



(A) a firearm which has a short stock and is designed 
to be held and fired by the use of a single hand; and 
(B) any combination of parts from which a firearm 
described in subparagraph (A) can be assembled. 



Basically, the waiting period provision makes it 
unlawful for any licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, 
or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to a 
nonlicensed individual (transferee), unless the licensee_
(1) Obtains a statement of the transferee's intent 
to obtain a handgun containing the transferee's name, 
address, and date of birth appearing on a valid photo 
identification, a description of the identification 
document, a statement that the transferee is not a felon, 
under indictment, or otherwise prohibited from receiving or 
possessing the handgun under Federal law, and the date the 
statement is made; 
(2) Verifies the identity of the transferee by examining 
the identification document presented; 
(3) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the 
statement, contacts the chief law enforcement officer of 
the place of residence of the transferee and advises such 
officer of the contents of the statement; 
(4) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the 
statement, transmits to the chief law enforcement officer 
of the place of residence of the transferee a copy of the 
statement; and 
(5) Waits 5 business days from the date the licensee 
furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the 
chief law enforcement officer before transferring the 
handgun to the transferee (during which period the licensee 
has not received information from the chief law enforcement 
officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the 
transferee would be in violation of law); or receives 
notice from the chief law enforcement officer of the place 
of residence of the transferee that the officer has no 
information that the transferee's receipt or possession of 
the handgun would violate the law. 
In addition to the items in (1) above, the regulations 
request certain additional optional information about the 
transferee to facilitate the transfer of a handgun and 
assist law enforcement officials in verifying the 
transferee's eligibility to possess a handgun. This 
optional information includes the social security 
number, height, weight, sex, and place of birth of the 
transferee. The optional information will help minimize 
the misidentification of handgun purchasers as felons or 
other prohibited persons whose receipt and possession of 
firearms violate the law. For example, this information 
would distinguish the transferee from a prohibited buyer 
having the same name and date of birth as the transferee 
and, therefore, help expedite the transfer. 
Subsequent to the sale or transfer of the handgun, the 
law requires a licensee, who receives a report from the 
chief law enforcement officer containing information that 
receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee 
violates Federal, State, or local law, shall within 1 day 
communicate any information the licensee has concerning the 
transfer to the chief law enforcement officer of the place 
of business of the licensee and to the chief law 
enforcement officer of the place of residence of the 
transferee. 
As provided in the Act, the term ``chief law enforcement 
officer'' means ``the chief of police, the sheriff, or an 
equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual.'' 
The law requires that the chief law enforcement officer 
within 5 business days make a reasonable effort to 
determine whether the transferee is prohibited by law from 
receiving or possessing the handgun sought to be purchased. 
Except for records relating to a proposed handgun sale that 
would violate the law, law enforcement officers are 
required to destroy within 20 days the purchaser's 
statement, any record containing information derived from 
the statement, and any record created as a result of the 
notice referred to in (3) above. Furthermore, these 
records may only be used to carry out the purposes of the 
Act, and no information in the records may be conveyed to 
any person for purposes other than complying with the Act.

The Act also provides that an individual who is 
determined to be ineligible to purchase a handgun under the 
waiting period provision may request that the 
chief law enforcement officer who made the determination 
provide reasons for that determination. The officer must 
provide such reasons to the individual in writing within 20 
business days after receipt of the request. 



Alternatives to the Waiting Period 



The statute provides the following alternatives to the 
waiting period provision: 

(1) The transferee provides a written statement issued 
within the last 10 days by the chief law enforcement 
officer of the transferee's place of residence that the 
transferee requires a handgun because of a threat to the 
life of the transferee or any member of the transferee's 
household; 

(2) The transferee presents to the licensee a permit 
issued by the State within the past 5 years to possess a handgun and the law of the State requires verification that 
the transferee is not prohibited by law from possessing the 
handgun; 

(3) Purchases in States which require that, before 
any licensee transfers a handgun to an individual, 
an authorized government official has verified that 
possession of the handgun by the transferee would not 
violate the law (e.g., a background check); 

(4) Purchases of handguns which are subject to the 
National Firearms Act and which have been approved for 
transfer under 27 CFR part 179 (Machine Guns, Destructive 
Devices, and Certain Other Firearms); 

(5) Purchases of handguns for which the Secretary has 
certified that compliance with the 5-day waiting period 
procedure is impracticable because the purchaser resides in 
a rural area, the premises of the licensee are remote in 
relation to the chief law enforcement officer of the area, 
and there is an absence of telecommunications facilities in 
the geographical area in which the business premises are 
located. 



Additional Provisions of Public Law 103-159 



Titles II and III of Public Law 103-159 provide additional 
amendments to the GCA. These provisions, which became 
effective on November 30, 1993, are as follows: 

(1) 

Multiple sales reports. 

In addition to furnishing 
reports of multiple handgun sales to ATF, licensees are required to submit such reports to the ``department of State

police or State law enforcement agency of the State or 
local law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which 
the sale or other disposition took place.'' 

(2) 

Common carriers. 

Common or contract carriers are 
prohibited from requiring or causing any label or other 
written notice to be placed on the outside of any package, 
luggage, or other container indicating that such package 
contains a firearm. In addition, common or contract 
carriers who deliver firearms in interstate or foreign 
commerce are required to obtain written acknowledgement 
of receipt from the recipient of the package or other 
container. 

(3) 

Theft of firearms. 

It is unlawful for any person to 
steal from the person or premises of a Federal firearms 
licensee any firearm in the licensee's business inventory 
which has been shipped or transported in interstate or 
foreign commerce. 

(4) 

License fees. 

License fees for all dealers in 
firearms (other than destructive devices), including 
pawnbrokers, have been increased to $200 for 3 years, 
except that the fee for renewal of a license is $90 for 
3 years.

Executive Order 12866 



It has been determined that this temporary rule is not 
a significant regulatory action, because the economic 
effects flow directly from the underlying statute and not 
from this temporary rule. Therefore, it is found that this 
temporary rule is not likely to (1) Have an annual effect 
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect 
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public 
health or safety, of State, local, or tribal governments or 
communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by 
another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact 
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise 
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, 
the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in 
this Executive order. 



Administrative Procedure Act 



Because this document merely implements the law and 
because immediate guidance is necessary to implement the 
provisions of the law, it is found to be impracticable 
to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public 
procedure under 5 U.S.C.  553(b), or subject to the 
effective date limitation in section 553(d). 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
relating to an initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this 
temporary rule because the agency was not required to 
publish a notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 
553 or any other law. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This regulation is being issued without prior notice 
and public procedure pursuant to the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For this reason, the 
collection of information contained in this regulation has 
been reviewed and, pending receipt and evaluation of public 
comments, approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) under control number 1512-0520. The estimated 
average annual burden associated with the collection 
of information in this regulation is 2.52 hours per 
respondent or recordkeeper. 

For further information concerning this collection 
of information, and where to submit comments on the 
collection of information and the accuracy of the estimated 
burden, and suggestions for reducing this burden, refer to 
the preamble to the cross-reference notice of proposed 
rulemaking published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal 
Register

(iii) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the statement, provide notice of the contents of the statement on
Form 5300.35, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to the chief law enforcement officer of
the place of residence of the transferee; and 
(iv) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the statement to the licensee, transmit a copy of Form 5300.35 to the
chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee. 
(2)(i) The licensee shall not sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to any individual unless 5 business days (meaning
days on which State offices are open) have elapsed from the date the licensee furnished actual notice of the contents
of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer, during which period the licensee has not received information
from such officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would be in violation of Federal, State,
or local law; or 
(ii) The licensee has received notice from the chief law enforcement officer within the 5 business days that the officer
has no information indicating that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would violate Federal,

not by telephone, notice shall be given by the licensee to the chief law enforcement officer in writing. In that case,
the 5-day waiting period prescribed by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section begins at the time such written notice
is received by the chief law enforcement officer. If the licensee sends notice to such officer by mail, the licensee

or the designee of any such individual.'' Where the State or local law enforcement officials have notified the licensee
that a particular official has been designated to receive the notice and statement specified in paragraphs (a)(1)
(iii) and (iv) of this section, the licensee shall provide the information to that designated official. 
(b) 

Alternatives to waiting period.

of the transferee's place of residence, stating that the transferee requires access to a handgun because of a threat
to the life of the transferee or of any member of the household of the transferee. The written statement must have been
issued by the chief law enforcement officer during the 10-day period ending on the date that the transferee has informed
the licensee of the transferee's intention to obtain a handgun. The written statement shall be on a letter bearing
the letterhead of the chief law enforcement officer and shall be signed by the officer and dated;

verified that the information available to such official does not indicate that possession of a handgun by the transferee
would be in violation of Federal, State, or local law;

be in violation of law; 
(4) The handgun is subject to the provisions of the National Firearms Act and has been approved for transfer under 27
CFR part 179; or 
(5) On application of the licensee, in accordance with the provisions of  178.150, the Director has certified
that compliance with paragraph (a) of this section is impracticable. 
(6) The documents referred to in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section shall be retained in the records of the licensee
in accordance with the provisions of  178.131. 
(c) 

Disclosure of information. 

(1) Any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer who, after the transfer of a handgun to a nonlicensee,
receives a report from a chief law enforcement officer containing information that receipt or possession of the handgun
by the transferee violates Federal, State, or local law shall, within 1 business day (meaning a day on which State offices
are open) after receipt of the report, communicate any information the licensee has concerning the transfer and the
transferee, including a copy of Form 4473 required by  
178.124, to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of business of the licensee and to the chief law enforcement
officer of the place of residence of the transferee. The licensee may also provide this information to the local ATF
office. 
(2) Any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer who receives information from a chief law enforcement
officer regarding the transfer of a handgun to a nonlicensee, not otherwise available to the public, shall not disclose
such information except to the transferee, to law enforcement authorities, or pursuant to the direction of a court

(Paragraph (b) approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget under control number 1512-0520; all other 
recordkeeping approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget under control number 1512-0129.) 






Par. 11.

 Sections 178.130 and 178.131 are added to 
Subpart H to read as follows: 



 178.130 

Statement of intent to obtain a handgun after 
February 27, 1994, and before November 30, 1998. 



(a)(1) Except as provided in   178.102(b) and 
178.131, a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or 
licensed dealer shall not sell, deliver, or transfer a 
handgun unless the licensee has received from the 
transferee a statement of intent to obtain a handgun on 
Form 5300.35 in duplicate. The statement shall contain the 
transferee's name, address, and date of birth. The 
transferee must date and execute the sworn statement contained on the form showing that the transferee is not 
under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for 
a term exceeding 1 year; has not been convicted in any 
court of such a crime; is not a fugitive from justice; is 
not an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled 
substance; has not been adjudicated as a mental defective 
or been committed to a mental institution; is not an alien 
who is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; 
has not been discharged from the Armed Forces under 
dishonorable conditions; and is not a person who, having 
been a citizen of the United States, has renounced such 
citizenship. 

(2) In order to facilitate the transfer of a handgun 
and enable the chief law enforcement officer to verify the 
identity of the person acquiring the handgun, Form 5300.35 
requests certain additional optional information. This 
information includes the social security number, height, 
weight, sex, and place of birth of the transferee. Such 
information may help avoid the possibility of the 
transferee being misidentified as a felon or other 
prohibited person. 

(b) Upon receipt of Form 5300.35 from the transferee, 
the licensee shall: 

(1) Verify the identity of the transferee by examining the identification document presented and note on 
Form 5300.35 the type of identification used; and 

(2) Complete Form 5300.35 to show that notice of the 
transferee's statement of intent to obtain a handgun and a 
copy of the form have been provided to the chief law 
enforcement officer in compliance with  178.102(a). 

(c) The licensee shall retain the original Form 
5300.35 as part of the records required to be kept under 
this subpart. If the sale, delivery, or transfer of the 
handgun to the transferee is made, Form 5300.35 shall be 
attached to the firearms transaction record, Form 4473, 
executed upon delivery of the handgun as provided in 
 178.124. If the sale, delivery, or transfer is not made, 
the licensee shall retain Form 5300.35 as part of the 
records required to be kept under this subpart. Forms 
5300.35 with respect to which a sale, delivery, or transfer 
did not take place shall be retained in alphabetical (by 
name of transferee) or chronological (by date of 
transferee's sworn statement) order. 

(d) The requirements of this section shall be in 
addition to any other recordkeeping requirements contained 
in this part. 

(e) A licensee may obtain, upon request, an emergency 
supply of Forms 5300.35 from any regional director 
(compliance).

period. 



(a)(1) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or 
licensed dealer whose sale, delivery, or transfer of a

delivery of the handgun. 

(4) If the transfer is pursuant to a verification
