 Notice of final results of antidumping duty changed circumstances review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 
On November 5, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its changed circumstances review
concerning its examination of whether Rotem Fertilizers, Ltd. (Rotem) is the successor to Negev Phosphates, Ltd.
(Negev). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Negev, and its merger
with Rotem. We have now completed this review and determine that, for purposes of applying the antidumping duty law,
Rotem is the successor to Negev and, as such, is subject to the revocation which applied to Negev. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On November 5, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 the preliminary results of its antidumping duty changed circumstances review on industrial phosphoric acid from
Israel (58 FR 59010). We have now completed this changed circumstances review in accordance with section 751 of the
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 



Scope of Review 



Imports covered by this review are shipments of industrial phosphoric acid (IPA). This product is currently classifiable
under item number 2809.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The written description remains dispositive.


The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Negev, and its merger with
Rotem. 



Successorship



In December 1991, Rotem and Negev, two companies within the Israeli Chemicals, Ltd. (ICL) group, merged to become
one corporate entity, Rotem. Subsequent to the merger, Negev was revoked from the antidumping duty order. (See Final
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation In Part of the Antidumping Duty Order (57 FR 10008;
March 23, 1992).) Before the merger, Rotem was not a producer of the subject merchandise and was never reviewed under
this order. 

Negev notified the Department in a March 30, 1992 letter that the company had merged with Rotem. The merger, which was
finalized December 31, 1991, was effective retroactively to 
January 1, 1991. During verification, the Department examined Rotem's sales and found no evidence of industrial
phosphoric acid sales prior to the merger. In the March 30, 1992 letter, Negev also identified Rotem as its successor
and requested that the Department issue a determination applying Negev's revocation to Rotem. Rotem began to ship
the subject merchandise to the United States on January 1, 1992. Its shipments have entered under the ``all other''
rate applicable to companies that had never been reviewed under the order. 

The Department has determined that Rotem is the successor to Negev for purposes of applying the antidumping duty law.
For a complete discussion of the basis for this decision see Industrial Phosphoric Acid From Israel; Preliminary
Results of Antidumping Duty Changed Circumstances Review, November 5, 1993, 
(58 FR 59010). 



Analysis of Comments Received 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the petitioners,
FMC Corporation and Monsanto, and from Rotem, the manufacturer/exporter covered by this review. 



Comment 1:

 Petitioners argue that the legal test for determining successorship with respect to an antidumping duty order is
that ``the Department will consider the acquiring company to be a successor if its resulting operation is essentially
similar to that of its predecessor.'' Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty
Administrative Review, (57 FR 5128, 5129; February 12, 1992). Petitioners maintain that after the merger, Rotem's
operation was not essentially similar to either that of Rotem or the former Negev because, after the merger, Rotem
became a fully integrated producer of both fertilizer and industrial grade acid, as well as a producer of rock phosphate.
Thus, the newly merged operations of Rotem constitute a company with a more integrated and expanded phosphoric acid
production.

<TEXT>
 

Petitioners also claim that in the preliminary results of the changed circumstances review, the Department failed
to consider Rotem as a new business entity because the Department was only looking at industrial phosphoric acid.
Petitioners argue that the proper legal standard for determining successorship is whether the ``resulting operation''
of the acquiring company is essentially similar to its predecessor.'' See Brass Sheet and Strip preliminary results.
Therefore, the merged Rotem should be examined with respect to its overall operations, not just its operations with
respect to the subject merchandise. Petitioners argue that since Rotem's operations are not the same as they were
prior to the merger with respect to all types of merchandise, Rotem should not be treated as a successor to Negev. 

In response to petitioners' argument that Rotem has become an integrated producer of phosphoric acid, respondent
claims that Negev's production of the subject merchandise was in fact fully integrated before the merger. Although
the merger further integrated the production of fertilizer grade acid, no changes have occurred with regard to the
production of the subject merchandise. 



Department's Position:

 We disagree with petitioners' assertion that the proper legal standard for determining successorship is whether
the acquiring company is similar to its predecessor with respect to its overall operations. In the preliminary results
for Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department found that ``concerning production and sales of brass sheet and strip,''
the acquiring company was operating essentially as the same business entity as its predecessor. See Brass Sheet and
Strip from Canada; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 5128, 5129; February 12,
1992). Moreover, in the final results for Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department agreed that since respondent's business
operation was essentially the same as that of its predecessor ``with regard to the production of brass sheet and strip,''
the acquiring company was essentially the same operation as its predecessor. See Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada;
Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 20460, 20462; May 13, 1992). Thus, in this review,
the Department has applied the same standard for determining successorship as the standard which was applied in the
preliminary and final results of Brass Sheet and Strip. 

Insofar as no explicit legal standard for determining successorship is provided by the statute or the Department's
regulations, the Department has discretion in deciding how to determine whether one company is a successor to another
for purposes of the antidumping duty law. In Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department examined the described factors
in terms of the operations which produce the subject merchandise. This has continued to be our approach in the instant
review. The operation producing the subject merchandise is the appropriate level at which to focus our analysis because
under the antidumping duty laws, we are examining pricing practices with respect to the subject merchandise. For
example, in this case, the antidumping duty order applies only to industrial phosphoric acid and reviews are conducted
only on sales of this merchandise. Thus it follows that an inquiry into the validity of a claim of successorship to a
respondent company should focus on that company's sales and production of the merchandise encompassed by the order.




Comment 2:

 Petitioners claim that when examining the four elements for determining successorship: (1) Management, (2) production
facilities, (3) supplier relationships, and 
(4) customer base, Rotem's operations are not a continuation of Negev's operations. 

With regard to management, petitioners argue that with the resulting changes in the board of directors and the production
management, there is a new and different management team in charge. Petitioners claim that there has not been a continuation
of the former Negev management in the new Rotem.

<DOCNO> FR940214-2-00005 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940214-2-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Petitioners also claim that since Rotem acquired Negev's production facilities, Rotem's total production facilities
are much more extensive than Negev's were. As a result of the merger, Rotem is a larger full-service phosphate and related
products producer and is not the same company that Negev was before the merger. 
Petitioners further maintain that supplier relationships have also changed as a result of the merger. The former
Negev obtained important raw material inputs from Rotem, which was then a separate company. Since the merger, raw
material input for the production of the subject merchandise is now supplied by captive internal production, which
petitioners argue constitutes a significant change in supplier relationships. 
As a result of the merger, petitioners also argue that Rotem now has a much larger and more diverse customer base than
Negev had. Furthermore, prior to the merger, Rotem, as a fertilizer producer, had no customers in the United States
and made no sales to the United States. Therefore, the merger opened up an entirely new market for Rotem. 
In contrast, the respondent maintains that the petitioners have presented no arguments that had not already been
taken into account in the preliminary results. Therefore, the Department has no grounds for reversing the preliminary
determination. 
With regard to changes in management, the respondent maintains that personnel changes as the result of the merger
are minimal. Furthermore, respondent argues that sales staff for the subject merchandise remained the same and most
of management, including top management in the company, retained their positions. 
Respondent claims that when addressing changes in production facilities, petitioners focus, as when addressing
other factors to determine successorship, on the production of non-subject merchandise. Prior to the merger, Negev
and Rotem formed a part of the same parent company. These two companies were both located at the same plant site and shared
some infrastructure. Moreover, products that were transferred from one company to another were transferred on special
intra-company terms. According to the respondent, these elements demonstrate that there was no change in production
facilities with regard to the subject merchandise. 
Respondent argues that petitioners' premise regarding supplier relationships is completely erroneous. Respondent
maintains that the raw material inputs obtained by Negev from Rotem are not essential or even necessary in the production
of the subject merchandise. Furthermore, when these raw materials were obtained from Rotem prior to the merger, they
were purchased under an intra-company pricing formula determined by the parent company. Therefore, there has been
no change in suppliers. 
With regard to customer base, respondent claims that the customer base for the subject merchandise did not change.
Respondent argues that petitioners are focusing on sales of non-subject merchandise, as illustrated by their example
of sales to new customer groups such as the farming community. According to the respondents, the farming community
does not have a need for the subject merchandise, industrial phosphoric acid.

Department's Position: 

We do not agree with petitioners assertion that Rotem's operations are not essentially similar to Negev's operations
prior to the merger in terms of: (1) Management, (2) production facilities, (3) supplier relationships, and 
(4) customer base, with regard to sales and production of the subject merchandise. 

With regard to executive personnel, Negev and Rotem's board of directors consists of seven and five members, respectively.
The president and three members of the board of directors, including the chairman of the board, are the same for both
Negev and Rotem. Therefore, Rotem's five member board of directors includes three members that were also on Negev's
board. 
An examination of production management shows that production management was consolidated after the merger. Before
the merger, there were two site managers and two operations managers, one set for Negev operations and the other for
Rotem operations. Now there is one site manager and one operations manager for Rotem's industrial phosphoric acid
and fertilizer acid facilities. After the merger, Negev's former vice-president became a Rotem executive vice-president.
The Negev plant manager prior to the merger left the company, and Rotem's plant manager became the plant manager for
both the Rotem and Negev plant facilities. Negev's former industrial phosphoric acid site manager remained with
Rotem for about six months after the merger and was then replaced by Rotem's operations manager whose responsibilities
became the management of both industrial phosphoric acid and fertilizer acid facilities. See Verification of the
Questionnaire Response_ Antidumping Duty Order on Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Israel_ Changed Circumstances
Review; October 6, 1993. 
The Department has considered these changes in Rotem's management and finds that the differences are minimal. The
changes in Rotem's personnel are well within the normal range of personnel changes that one would expect over time
within the same operation. For example, in the final results of Brass Sheet and Strip, the Department found one company
to be the successor of another despite the fact that the successor company had replaced the two top managers at the acquired
plant. See Brass Sheet and Strip Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, (57 FR 20462; May 13, 1992).

With regard to production facilities, we agree with respondents that petitioners improperly focus on the production
of non-subject merchandise to support their claim that Rotem's total production is more extensive and diverse. Rotem
did not alter production or the production facilities of the subject merchandise at the time of the merger. Moreover,
the subject merchandise continued to be manufactured in the former company's plant facilities. Furthermore, eleven
months after the merger, the Department verified that Rotem had not altered production or production facilities
for the subject merchandise subsequent to the merger. 
When reviewing supplier relationships, petitioners argue that as a result of the merger, Rotem now has a captive source
of supply for certain raw material inputs necessary for production of the subject merchandise. During verification,
the Department carefully examined supplier relationships for all raw material inputs in the production of the subject
merchandise and found that the source of supplies for these inputs did not change after the merger. As respondents
point out, before the merger Negev purchased raw material inputs from Rotem at intra-company prices and, after the
merger, Rotem continued to supply these inputs. 
Finally, in their discussion of changes in customer base, petitioners submit that as a result of the merger, Rotem
has a larger and more diverse customer base. As in their evaluation of other factors, petitioners focus on the inclusion
of Rotem's customers for non-subject merchandise. As stated in our response to comment one, the appropriate focus
of our analysis is the subject merchandise. We agree with the respondents that the customer base for Rotem's sales
of the subject merchandise did not change after the merger.

Finally, as requested, Rotem has submitted an agreement as set forth at  353.25(a)(2)(iii) to be reinstated
in the order should the Secretary conclude under  353.22(f) that the company, subsequent to revocation, sold
industrial phosphoric acid at less than foreign market value. 

In conclusion, after reviewing all comments, the Department determines that Rotem is the successor to Negev. 



Final Results of Review 



After reviewing the comments received, we determine that Rotem is successor to Negev and, accordingly, is not subject
to the antidumping duty order. We will instruct customs to liquidate all entries of this merchandise produced by Rotem,
exported to the United States and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after January 1, 1991.
In addition, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation on entries
from Rotem and to liquidate, without regard to antidumping duties, merchandise exported by Rotem on or after January
1, 1991. 

This changed circumstances review and notice are in accordance with section 751(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22(f).

Notice of decision of panel.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By a decision dated January 28, 1994, the Binational Panel reviewing the redetermination on remand of the final affirmative
material injury determination made by the U.S. International Trade Commission respecting Certain Softwood Lumber
Products from Canada (Secretariat File No. USA-92-1904-02) affirmed in part and remanded in part
the redetermination to the Commission for further action. A copy of the complete panel decision is available from
the Binational Secretariat.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace
domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports
from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel
is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether
it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.



Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and
the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules'').
These Rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panel Reviews, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). The Rules were further amended and a consolidated version of the amended Rules was
published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26698). The panel review in this matter was conducted in accordance with these Rules.

Panel Decision



On January 28, 1994, the Binational Panel affirmed in part and remanded in part the final affirmative injury redetermination
made by the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 25, 1993. 

The Panel affirmed the Commission's remand determination with regard to imports from Quebec. 
The Panel remanded the Commission's redetermination in the following respects: 

(1) With respect to the Commission's causation determination, the Panel found that the information and analysis
regarding the role of SPF in the U.S. softwood lumber market, and the regional price and import penetration comparisons,
do not constitute substantial evidence of price suppression by reason of imports of softwood lumber from Canada or
are not otherwise in accordance with law. 

(2) As to the Commission's price trends analysis, the Panel found that the analysis, in its present form, did not contitute
substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law.

The Panel further found that, should the Commission on remand rely on price trends data to support an affirmative determination,
the Commission is to provide a full analysis and explanation of the underlying data and the methodology employed in
the creation and presentation of the price trends analysis. 

The Binational Panel instructed The Commission to provide its determination on remand within 45 days of the panel
decision (by March 14, 1994).

Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Public Hearings



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public hearings on Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for Pacific Coast Groundfish.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is holding hearings on a proposed Amendment 8 to its Pacific Coast Groundfish
fishery management plan (FMP). The amendment would establish an individual quota (IQ) program to cover the harvest
of sablefish by vessels with groundfish limited entry permits for longline and fishpot (trap) gear. Harvest of sablefish
by: (1) Trawl gear in the limited entry fishery, or (2) longline, fishpot (trap) and exempted gear by unlicensed vessels
in the open access fishery, would not be covered by the proposed IQ program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The fixed gear sablefish IQ program designed by the Council would allocate sablefish QS (quota share_a percentage
of the total annual harvest guideline) to persons based primarily on catch history. Each year, holders of QS would
be allocated an amount of sablefish IFQ (individual fishing quota_an amount of sablefish pounds for the year based
on the amount of QS held) that could be taken anytime during the fishing season.



A recent participation requirement would require at least one landing of sablefish or groundfish (to be determined)
with longline or fishpot gear between August 1, 1988, and November 13, 1991, in order for a person to qualify for an initial
allocation of QS. There may also be a minimum amount of sablefish landings which must be made between January 1, 1984,
and November 13, 1991. QS would be allocated to owners of ``A'' permits for longline or fishpot (trap) gear based at
least in part on one of the following catch histories: (1) The catch history of the permit owned at the time QS is issued,
(2) the catch history of the person as a vessel owner, or (3) some combination of the two. Confidentiality issues may
affect the choice among these options and the ability of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to implement this
program. Catch history occurring between January 1, 1984, and November 13, 1991, would be counted in determining
the amount of QS issued. Under allocation formulas being considered, between 75 and 100 percent of the quota shares
would be allocated on the basis of the best five of eight years of catch history. Up to 25 percent might be allocated primarily
on the basis of an equal allocation concept.

The Council is considering a number of optional provisions for the program including: (1) Caps on the amount of QS/IFQ
that may be issued to or accumulated by, a single person and the amount that may be used with a single vessel, and (2) requirements
that the QS/IFQ owner be on board the vessel when the IFQ is used. The latter of these provisions implies that leasing
would not be allowed. The provision may be combined with restrictions on the acquisition of QS/IFQ by corporations,
partnerships and other non-individual entities that do not receive an initial allocation.

All hearings will start at 7 p.m. The following are the dates and locations:

The Council will consider an adjustment to the Multispecies (Groundfish) FMP under the framework for abbreviated
rulemaking (50 CFR 651.40) contained in Amendment 5 to the FMP which was approved on January 3, 1994. The proposed rule
for Amendment 5 was published on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57774); a final rule is expected to be effective on March 1, 1994,
and published before that date.

At the request of the ASMFC Winter Flounder Board, the Council will discuss and accept public comment on a proposal
to limit the winter flounder component of the 500-pound (226.8 kg) groundfish possession to 100 pounds (45.3 kg).
The final rule discussed above, when implemented, will allow vessels to keep up to 500 pounds (226.8 kg), combined
weight, of the 10 large-mesh groundfish species while fishing with mesh smaller than the regulated minimum size.

The ASMFC is concerned that a 500-pound (226.8 kg) limit is an incentive to target winter flounder with small mesh that
may result in the discarding of unacceptable numbers of winter flounder that are under the currently legal minimum
fish size of 12 inches (30.48 cm). The ASMFC is urging the Council to take this action to protect a moderately strong
1992 year class of winter flounder, which will be susceptible to the small-mesh fishing gear before reaching the minimum
legal size.



Adjustment of Closure of Area I To Gillnetting



The Council will also consider an adjustment to the closure of Area I to gillnetting in the Multispecies FMP under the
framework for abbreviated rulemaking contained in the proposed rule published on October 27, 1993. At the request
of a number of sink gillnet fishermen, the Council will discuss and take public comment on a proposal to shift the time
of the closure of Area I to gillnetting. The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the Multispecies FMP will open Area
I to all fishing gear types except sink gillnets. Unless modified by a framework measure, gillnetting will be prohibited
from February through May.

The Council proposed to open Area I to all gears except sink gillnets because haddock spawning has not been observed
in the area in recent years. At the recommendation of the NMFS Regional Director, the Council proposed retaining the
closure of Area I to gillnetting because of the potential interaction with endangered whales, which are known to feed
in the area during the spring. The February through May closure period was originally set to protect aggregations
of spawning haddock and does not coincide with the observed presence of the whales, which the gillnetting closure
is intended to protect. The Council proposes to begin the closure of Area I in the middle of March and extend it to the
middle of July.



Time/Area Closures To Reduce the Take of Harbor Porpoise in the Gulf of Maine Sink Gillnet Fishery



At the request of the NMFS and the Council's Marine Mammal and Endangered Species Committee, the Council has developed
proposals to reduce the take of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery by the end of year 4 of implementation
of the Northeast Multispecies FMP to a level not to exceed 2 percent of the porpoise population, based on the best available
estimates of abundance and catch.

Under the framework for abbreviated rulemaking (50 CFR 651.40, to be published in March 1994) the Council has requested
its Harbor Porpoise Review Team (HPRT) to evaluate ``reduction of take measures'' for the harbor porpoise bycatch
in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery. Those measures, which include closures in the Gulf of Maine by area and time,
any recommendations made by the HPRT, and public comments, will be discussed at the February 16 and 17 Council meeting
in order to initiate the framework process.

At the February 16-17 Council meeting, the Council will determine whether the requested adjustment to the regulations
for sea scallops and groundfish are necessary and will initiate a public comment period. The Council staff will analyze
the proposals and announce the availability of analysis documents prior to the second Council meeting (April 6-7,
1994). The public will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal(s) prior to and at the April Council meeting.
After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council will make a recommendation to the
Regional Director. The Regional Director may publish the action as a final rule or as a proposed rule, as described
in  651.40.

<DOCTITLE>Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for Proposed Amarillo Upgrade
Project and </DOCTITLE>
Request for Comments 




February 8, 1994.






The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of new facilities and the abandonment
of existing facilities proposed in the Amarillo Upgrade Project.
 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is required and whether or not to approve the project. 








Summary of the Proposed Project 






Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) wants Commission authorization to: 






 Abandon about 490 miles of the Amarillo No. 1 mainline between Compressor Station 111 in Hutchinson County,
Texas, and Compressor Station 198 in Marion County, Iowa; 






 Abandon one 12,000-horsepower (hp) compressor engine at Compressor Station 195 in Washington County, Kansas;







 Construct and operate about 9.41 miles of new 30-inch-diameter pipeline in Hutchinson County, Texas (Segment
1); 






 Construct and operate about 5.1 miles of new 36-inch-diameter pipeline in Ford County, Kansas (Segment 2);







 Construct and operate about 4.1 miles of new 36-inch-diameter pipeline in Lincoln County, Kansas (Segment
3); 






 Construct and operate about 9.46 miles of new 36-inch-diameter pipeline in Otoe County, Nebraska (Segment
4); and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940214-2-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940214-2-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Add 2,500 hp of compression by retrofitting an existing 12,500-hp engine at Compressor Station 195, in Washington
County, Kansas. 






The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1.
 



Land Requirements for Construction 






Natural proposes to abandon about 490 miles of 24-inch-diameter Amarillo No. 1 mainline and to remove it over a 4- to
5-year period. Natural proposes to leave the pipe in place in sensitive areas (such as waterbody crossings, wetland
crossings, and areas of cultural and sensitive biological resources) where it believes removal activities could
result in significant environmental impacts. 






The Amarillo No. 1 mainline is next to the Amarillo No. 4 mainline. The segments of proposed new pipeline would loop
 the Amarillo No. 4 mainline. The segments of proposed new pipeline would generally be placed in the same trench as the
Amarillo No. 1 mainline after the segments of that pipeline are removed. 








Natural proposes to use a 75-foot-wide to 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way, at least partly within existing
rights-of-way. Areas of steep slope, staging areas, and other areas where additional right-of-way would be needed
to permit safe construction would be identified on a site-specific basis. No new permanent right-of-way would be
required. Abandonment of all 490 miles of pipe by removal and construction of the replacement pipeline would disturb
about 5,900 acres. Most of the acreage disturbed would consist of existing pipeline right-of-way. 






One storage yard, about 4 acres in size, would be required for each of the four segments of new pipeline. Storage yards,
about 6 acres in size, would be required about every 50 miles for the removal of the abandoned Amarillo No. 1 mainline.
Private roads/lanes would be used to access the pipeline during construction and removal. These roads may require
repair and upgrading to support increased traffic. 






The EA Process 






The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By the
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. 






The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction, operation, and abandonment of the proposed
project facilities under these general headings: 






 Geology and soils 
 Water resources, fisheries, 
and wetlands 
 Vegetation and wildlife 
 Endangered and threatened species 
 Land use
 Cultural resources
 Hazardous waste






We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 
Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings.
A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will then consider all comments on the EA before
we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project. 


Currently Identified Environmental Issues 


We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Natural. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list; the
list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our own analysis. The currently
identified issues are: 
 The removal of abandoned pipeline and construction of new pipeline could affect 30.42 acres of wetlands. 
 The project could cross habitat of the least tern, bald eagle, and whooping crane (federally listed endangered
species) and of the piping plover (a federally listed threatened species). 
 The project could cross habitat of the Arkansas darter, Arkansas river shiner, snowy plover, and eastern spotted
skunk (Federal candidate species). 
 Pipeline would be abandoned within the Fort Larned National Historic Site (a National Historic Landmark).

 The abandoned pipe may be coated with materials that contain asbestos.

Public Participation 



You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should
focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes for the loops), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the
more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly
recorded: 

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426; 

 Reference Docket No. CP93-672-000; 
 Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Mark Jensen, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol St., NE., room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and 

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before March 10, 1994. 

If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Mark Jensen of the Commission staff at the above
address. 


Becoming an Intervenor 


In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or an
``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents
and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties.
If you want to become an intervenor, you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules
of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. In certain cases environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. Section 385.214(d)
applies to grants of late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.

<DOCTITLE>Sho-Me Power Corp.; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>





February 8, 1994.




In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Niangua Hydroelectric Project, located on the Niangua River in
Camden County, Missouri near the city of Camdenton, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the
project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts
of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for the review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices
at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.



Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix ``Niangua
Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 2561-003'' to all comments. For further information, contact Joe Davis, Environmental

February 8, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for license for the Upper Kezar Falls Hydroelectric Project located on the Ossipee River, in York
and Oxford Counties, Maine, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project.

On September 24, 1993, staff issued and distributed to all parties a draft EA, and requested that comments on the draft
EA be filed within 30 days. All comments that were filed have been considered in the EA.

In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the environmental effects of the project and has concluded that approval

<DOCTITLE>El Paso Natural Gas Co., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



February 4, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission. 



1. El Paso Natural Gas Co.


[Docket No. CP94-183-000]



Take notice that on January 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (``El Paso''), a Delaware corporation, whose mailing
address is Post Office Box 1492, El Paso, Texas, 79978, filed an application at Docket No. CP94-183-000,
pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (``NGA'') and  157.5 et seq., of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission's (``Commission'') Regulations Under the NGA, for an order granting abandonment authority effective
January 1, 1996, and terminating certain certificates of public convenience and necessity in effect on such date
to the extent such certificates apply to El Paso's gas gathering, dehydration, purification, and products extraction
facilities, with appurtenances. 

El Paso states that it intends, effective January 1, 1996, to complete a major corporate restructuring in which all
of El Paso's gas gathering, treating, and processing functions will be transferred to and assumed by El Paso Field
Services Company (``Field Services''), El Paso's wholly-owned subsidiary. After facility transfer, El Paso will
no longer perform any gathering, dehydration, purification, or products extraction activities, nor will it own
any facilities for that purpose. 




El Paso states that, first, it desires abandonment authorization only with respect to those facilities that the Commission
finds constitute nonjurisdictional gathering or processing facilities under section 1(b) of the NGA. Second, Field
Services requires and, in its Petition for Declaratory Order filed concurrently with El Paso's abandonment application,
requests a determination that it may establish the rates, terms, and conditions for the nonjurisdictional services
it provides through negotiations with the parties requesting such services. With respect to gathering facilities
that were certificated, El Paso seeks and order: (1) Determining that the facilities are not jurisdictional facilities;
and (2) upon said determination, granting abandonment authority with respect to any certificate that would otherwise
be in the effect on January 1, 1996, to the extent such certificate applies to a nonjurisdictional facility. All of
the certificated facilities for which abandonment is sought constitute nonjurisdictional gathering or processing
facilities under the primary function test developed in Farmland Industries Inc., 23 FERC  61,063 (1983),
it is asserted. 

El Paso states that the certificated facilities which constitute part of El Paso's gathering systems, and for which
abandonment is requested represent only $77.418,883 of gross plant out of a total of $519,464,972 of gross plant for
all facilities to be transferred to Field Services and, on a net plant basis, only $43,151,458 out of the $221,296,764
of total gathering system net plant (as of November 30, 1993). 

In addition, El Paso states that although it will cease to provide gathering and related services currently being
rendered under its part 284 Transportation Service Agreements (``TSA''), Field Services, as described in its Petition
for Declaratory Order, intends to offer to provide all of such services on an open-access basis. Thus, there will be
no interruption of the services available to any party currently receiving service under such a TSA. 

In addition to its part 284 transactions, El Paso sets forth that in a few instances El Paso provides transportation
services pursuant to arrangements that are filed as ``special rate schedules'' in Volume No. 2 of El Paso's FERC Gas
Tariff. Special Rate Schedule Z-8 is a Gathering Agreement between El Paso and TOC-Rocky Mountain Inc., as successor
to Tenneco Oil Company, dated May 9, 1984, providing for gathering services in the San Juan Basin. Special Rate Schedule
Z-9 is a similar Gathering Agreement between El Paso and Conoco Inc. also dated May 9, 1984, and providing for
gathering services in the San Juan Basin. Inasmuch as all of the facilities required for performance under the Agreements
will be transferred to Field Services, El Paso intends to assign the two Agreements to Field Services effective January
1, 1996. El Paso requested Commission authorization to cancel special Rate Schedules Z-8 and Z-9 and for
such abandonment authorization as may be necessary for that purpose. 

El Paso also requests such authorization as may be necessary to abandon services under special Rate Schedule T-14
(Volume No. 2 Combination Agreement with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America) insofar as it provides for gathering
or related services utilizing the facilities to be transferred to Field Services. In addition, with respect to certain
exchange arrangements contained in El Paso's Volume No. 2 Tariff which provides for El Paso to redeliver gas received
on its mainline system to delivery points on its gathering system, El Paso intends to enter into appropriate arrangements
with Field Services to accomplish the redeliveries required and thus does not request any Commission authorization
with respect to such arrangements. El Paso sets forth that Field Services will provide service as an open-access transporter
and specifically intends to provide any necessary gathering services. 

El Paso states that the conveyance of El Paso's gathering facilities to Field Services on January 1, 1996, will not
have any impact on El Paso's existing gas sales obligations and arrangements, nor will it affect El Paso's performance
under any existing gas purchase contract. 

El Paso avers that all mainline services currently provided by El Paso will continue to be provided in accordance with
El Paso's FERC Gas Tariff. No material rate issues are raised by the transfer of these facilities. Finally, there will
be no adverse environmental effects from the abandonment proposed herein.

2. Columbia Gas Transmission 


[Docket No. CP94-202-000]



Take notice that on January 28, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Gas), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue,
SE., Charleston, West Virginia 25314-1599, filed in Docket No. CP94-202-000 a request pursuant
to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to install
a new point of delivery for interruptible transportation service to Commonwealth Gas Services, Inc. (Commonwealth),
as existing customer, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP86-240-000, all as more fully
set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Columbia Gas states that Commonwealth has requested the new point of delivery. Columbia Gas indicates that the estimated
maximum daily quantity and the estimated annual quantity of natural gas that it will provide through the new delivery
point is 55,000 Dth and 20,075,000 Dth, respectively. Columbia Gas further states that the quantities to be provided
through the new delivery point will be provided on an interruptible basis and therefore, there is no impact on Columbia
Gas' existing design day and annual obligations to its customers as a result of the construction and operation of the
new point of delivery for interruptible transportation service.

3. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.



[Docket No. CP94-205-000] 



Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252,
filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-205-000 pursuant to Section 157.205
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to operate three existing delivery
point facilities (which were constructed under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978) under Tennessee's
blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-413-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully
set forth in the request which is open to public inspection. 

Tennessee proposes to operate the Franklin Gas Lift delivery point in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana; the Hurricane Sales
delivery point in Putnam County, West Virginia; and the Plymouth Sales delivery point in San Patricio County, Texas,
under its blanket certificate. Tennessee asserts that since it now renders significant transportation service
under its Subpart G blanket certificate, operation of the delivery points would provide more flexibility in using
its facilities to the benefit of all customers on Tennessee's system. Tennessee states that the delivery of natural
gas volumes through these existing delivery points would not impact Tennessee's peak day and annual deliveries;
that its tariff permits the proposed activity; and that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the proposed changes
without detriment or disadvantage to Tennessee's other customers. 



Comment date:

4. Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation



[Docket No. CP94-206-000] 



Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) 5400 Westheimer Court,
Houston, Texas 77056-5310, filed in Docket No. CP94-206-000, a request pursuant to Sections 157.205

5. Southern California Gas Co.



[Docket No. CP94-207-000]



Take notice that on February 1, 1994, Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), 555 West Fifth Street, Los Angeles,
California 90013-1011, filed an application in Docket No. CP94-207-000. The application requests
authorization under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, and the issuance of a Presidential Permit under Executive Order
10485, as amended by Executive Order 12038. SoCalGas seeks the Section 3 authorization and the Presidential Permit
so that it may construct, connect, operate, and maintain certain natural gas pipeline and metering export facilities.
The export facilities will be located in Imperial County, California, near the International Boundary between the
United States and the Republic of Mexico.

SoCalGas proposes to construct and operate the following export facilities:

(1) One metering station consisting of one 8-inch turbine meter run and one 12-inch turbine meter run; and,

(2) Either approximately:

(a) 900 feet of 16-inch diameter pipeline, with appurtenances, connecting the meter station to the border, (Bowker
Road Alternative); or,

(b) 4,800 feet of 16-inch diameter pipeline, with appurtenances, connecting the meter station to the border, (Calzada
Justo Sierra Alternative).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940214-2-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940214-2-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

SoCalGas says that it will notify the Commission of the particular site of the border crossing no later than May 1, 1994.
The export facilities will have a capacity of 40,000 Mcf per day. SoCalGas estimates the cost of the Bowker Road Alternative
to be about  350,000 and the cost of the Calzada Justo Sierra Alternative to be about  590,000. 

SoCalGas says that the export facilities will be used to provide natural gas transportation service from receipt
points on the SoCalGas systems to the United States_Mexico border. The rates for this service will be rates on file
with, and approved by, the California Public Utilities Commission. Any third-party shippers or exporters will be
required to obtain the proper export authorization from the United States Department of Energy, Office of Fossil
Energy. 

A connecting pipeline to receive the exported natural gas will be built on the Mexican side of the border and operated
by Petroleos Mexicanos. SoCalGas also describes certain other related facilities which are scheduled to be built
by it in Imperial County. SoCalGas says that these facilities, (about 31 miles of pipeline, with appurtenances),
are under the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission. SoCalGas says that they will be used to
serve native California natural gas load, in conjunction with the export transportation service. 

SoCalGas says that this overall project will permit the export of natural gas to the City of Mexicali, Mexico, to serve
both the existing local distribution system in Mexicali and industrial end-users in the Mexicali area. 
SoCalGas says that these customers presently use propane-air, liquefied petroleum gas, diesel fuel, high sulfur
fuel oil and other petroleum products. SoCalGas says that the replacement of these products by natural gas will result
in a reduction in air pollution in the U.S.-Mexico border area. 


SoCalGas requests that approval of this application be granted no later than June 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Gas Transport, Inc.; Application </DOCTITLE>



January 21, 1994.



Take notice that on January 7, 1994, Gas Transport, Inc. (GTI), P.O. Box 1323, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26101, filed
in Docket No. CP94-175-000 an application pursuant to Sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for permission
and approval to abandon a 360-horsepower compressor and to replace it with a 180-horsepower compressor in Washington
County, Ohio, and to install a 360-horsepower compressor and appurtenant facilities in Wood County, West Virginia,
all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

GTI proposes to replace the existing compressor in Ohio to permit more efficient operation of its system along with
lower operating costs. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the compressor would be $31,000. GTI proposes to
install the compressor in West Virginia in order to provide gas supplies currently supplied by transportation by
Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. It is stated that this compressor would permit GTI to utilize its system more
efficiently and to reduce the cost of service for its customers by avoiding transportation costs. It is estimated
that the cost of installing the compressor would be $30,000. It is stated that the costs associated with both compressors
would be recovered from internally generated funds. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before February
11, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate and permission and approval to abandon are required by the public convenience
and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely file, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that
a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. 






Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for GTI to appear or be represented
at the hearing.

January 21, 1994.







Take notice that on January 6, 1994, Mojave Pipeline Company (Mojave), 5001 E. Commercenter Drive, Bakersfield,
California 93309, filed in Docket No. CP94-172-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to construct a sales tap under Mojave's blanket
certificate issued in Docket Nos. CP89-1-000 and CP89-2-000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.






Mojave proposes to construct a connection between its existing 30-inch line and the All American Gas Pipeline Company's
(All American) gas supply pipeline to its Cadiz pump-station in San Bernardino California.

Mojave states that it would transport the gas on behalf of All American pursuant to its existing blanket transportation
certificate under existing rate schedules. Mojave states further because All American's firm entitlement is less
than the previously uncommitted capacity on Mojave, service to Mojave's other customers should not be affected by
transportation on behalf of All American.






Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to

<DOCTITLE>Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project; Public Meetings</DOCTITLE>



The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announce the following meetings.






Date:

 Wednesday, February 16, 1994.



Time:

 10 a.m.-4 p.m.



Place:

 Best Western-Ameritel Inn, 900 Lindsay Boulevard, Idaho Falls, Idaho 83402. 






Date:

 Wednesday, March 2, 1994.



Time:

 10 a.m.-4 p.m.



Place:

 Best Western-Cotton Tree Inn, 1415 Bench Road, Pocatello, Idaho 83201. 






Date:

 Wednesday, March 23, 1994.



Time:

 10 a.m.-4 p.m.



Place:

 Red Lion Inn-Riverside, 2900 Chinden Boulevard, Boise, Idaho 83714. 




STATUS:

 Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. The meeting room will accommodate
approximately 100 people.




PURPOSE:

 Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic
investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed
to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility
to CDC.



In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates
the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104,
107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund'').
These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed
for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other
health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries,
health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological
profiles.

Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental
dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, as well as a worker
study at the same site, the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of Idaho citizens
to provide consensus advice regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain
authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department
of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The draft charter for this proposed committee
states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each DOE site, operational guidelines at each site
must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and the responsibilities of the Committee members
and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public meetings to begin developing operational
guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of these public meetings is to update the public on the status of CDC's
and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice and recommendations from interested parties
concerning operational guidelines. A copy of the proposed ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service
Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' draft charter is available upon request from the contact person listed below.

Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.




CONTACT PERSON FOR MORE INFORMATION:

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing to amend the Box Elder Resource Management Plan (RMP) and prepare
the associated Environmental Assessment (EA), which includes public lands in Box Elder County, Utah.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice is intended to inform the public of the planning effort and to invite public participation in the identification
of the planning issues and planning criteria. Public comment will be solicited throughout the planning process.
The amended Box Elder RMP will be prepared under 43 CFR, part 1610 to meet the requirements of section 202 of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act. Decisions generated during this planning process will supersede the decisions in
the 1986 Box Elder RMP. 




The RMP amendment and EA will address the general planning issue of management prescriptions for numerous scattered
tracts of land (approximately 42,350 acres) which have been acquired and to address management of future land acquisitions.
Specific items to be addressed include the possible designation of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)
in the Salt Wells Wildlife Area (WHA), Blue Springs WHA, and the inclusion of additional public lands within the Central
Pacific Railroad Grade ACEC and the Donner Creek/Bettridge Creek ACEC. Other topics will include livestock grazing,
oil and gas, off-road-vehicle use, wilderness, and land tenure adjustments and any other planning issues that may
need to be addressed.


Tentative planning criteria to be used are those identified in the existing Box Elder RMP.


Public participation is being sought at this initial stage in the planning process to ensure the RMP amendment addresses
all issues, problems, and concerns from those interested in the management of lands within the Bear River Resource
Area. Necessary amendments to the approved plan will keep the document current and viable.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Central Railroad Company; Abandonment Exemption; in Perry and Randolph Counties, IL </DOCTITLE>


Illinois Central Railroad Company (IC) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments
to abandon its Sparta District line between milepost 576.28 (V.S. 30435+31) and milepost 579.30 (V.S. 30594+96)
near Willisville, IL, a distance of approximately 3.0 miles, in Perry and Randolph Counties, IL.

1

 




IC states that, in a related Notice of Exemption filed January 21, 1994, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company seeks discontinuance
of trackage rights and lease termination regarding the Sparta District line in Docket No. AB-3 
(Sub-No. 114X). 
IC has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic
on the line; (c) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or a state or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or
with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements
at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report); 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report); 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49
CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication); and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met.

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under


Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen

, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for
partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on March 13, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

2

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

3

 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29

4

 must be filed by February 21, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must
be filed by March 3, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington,
DC 20423. 






A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Myles L. Tobin, 455
North Cityfront Plaza Dr., 20th Fl., Chicago, IL 60611. 
If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void 

ab initio.

 
IC has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environmental and
historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by
February 16, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce
Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on
environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public.

Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision. 



Decided: February 3, 1994.

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration; Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the Federal Register,

 or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

8. Gatliff Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-13-C] 


Gatliff Coal Company, P.O. Box 39, Nevisdale, Kentucky 40754 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
75.360(b)(6) (preshift examination) to its Blue Gem 

#

6 Deep Mine (I.D. No. 15-12475) located in Whitley County, Kentucky. Due to adverse roof conditions in the parallel
intake air course, the area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner states that the area involved was driven off
a parallel pure intake air course prior to the new ventilation regulation of November 1992, that even with extensive
cribbing the intake area has developed adverse roof conditions, and that to perform preshift examinations of the
room necks would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to install methane detecting sensors at the areas of approach
in the parallel intakes and an additional methane detecting sensor where the air which has coursed by these room necks,
driven in excess of 20 feet deep, joins with the main mine intake. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


9. Arclar Company 


[Docket No. M-94-14-C] 


Arclar Company, 29 West Raymond, P.O. Box 444, Harrisburg, Illinois 62946 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 18.41 to its Big Ridge Mine (I.D. No. 11-02879) located in Saline County, Illinois. The petitioner proposes
to use fabricated metal locking devices with a locking screw threaded through a steel bracket to lock battery plugs
to machine-mounted battery receptacles on permissible, mobile, battery-powered machines instead of using padlocks;
and to submit a training plan for all operators of this equipment concerning this proposed alternate method to the
Agency and District Manager. 


10. AKZO Salt, Inc. 


[Docket No. M-94-05-M] 


AKZO Salt, Inc., P.O. Box 6920, Cleveland, Ohio 44101 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 57.19109
to its Cleveland Mine (I.D. No. 33-01994) located in Cuyahoga 
County, Ohio. The petitioner proposes to install pairs of cables approximately 4 feet above and parallel to the divider
timbers to enhance the function of the timbers; to cover the sides of each divider timber with ultra-high molecular
weight polyethylene material to reduce abrasion to the timbers; in addition to water slicing, to inspect the shaft
prior to conducting any work on the platform to ensure that there are no loose material on the sides of the shaft; to place
barricades around the shaft at both the collar and mine level prior to doing work on the platform; and to provide training
to all personnel working on the platform. The petitioner states that to place boards across the shaft at the mine level
when personnel are required to work on the dividers 
would result in a diminution of safety and would expose miners to hazardous conditions. In addition, the petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of renewal of the Licensing Support System Advisory Review Panel (LSSARP).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Licensing Support System Advisory Review Panel was established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a Federal
Advisory Committee in 1989. Its purpose is to provide advice to (1) the Department of Energy on the fundamental issues
of design and development of an electronic information management system to be used to store and retrieve documents
relating to the licensing of a geologic repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste, and (2) the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission on the operation and maintenance of the system. This electronic information management system
is known as the Licensing Support System (LSS).




Membership on the Panel is drawn from those interests that will be affected by the use of the LSS, including the Department
of Energy, the NRC, the State of Nevada, Tribal interests, affected units of local governments in Nevada, and the nuclear
industry. Federal agencies with expertise and experience in electronic information management systems also participate
on the Panel.


The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that renewal of the charter for the LSSARP until December 19, 1994
is in the public interest in connection with duties imposed on the Commission by law. This action is being taken in accordance
with the Federal Advisory Committee Act after consultation with the Committee Management Secretariat, General
Services Administration.

<DOCTITLE>Detroit Edison Co.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirement
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.A.6(b) to Detroit Edison Company (the licensee), for operation of the
Fermi 2 Plant, located in Monroe County, Michigan.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would grant an exemption from the accelerated Type A integrated leak rate test frequency requirement
of Appendix J, Paragraph III.A.6(b) of 10 CFR part 50. On May 24, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from paragraph
III.A.6(b) which requires that if two consecutive Type A tests fail to meet the acceptance criteria, a Type A test shall
be performed at each plant shutdown for refueling or approximately every 18 months, whichever occurs first, until
two consecutive Type A tests meet the acceptance criteria. The licensee identified the cause of the Type A failures
as Type C local leakage which has subsequently been corrected. The licensee reference NRC Information Notice (IN)
85-71, ``Containment Integrated Leak Rate Tests,'' for guidance concerning the requested exemption. IN 85-71
states that ``if Type B and C leakage rates constitute an identified contributor to this failure of the as-found condition
for the CILRT [Type A containment integrated leak rate test], the general purpose of maintaining a high degree of containment
integrity might be better served through an improved maintenance and testing program for containment penetration
boundaries and isolation valves. In this situation, the licensee may submit a Corrective Action Plan with an alternative
leakage test program proposal as an exemption request for NRC staff review.'' If this submittal is approved, the licensee
is allowed to implement the corrective actions in lieu of the required increased in Type A test frequency.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption is needed because compliance to paragraph III.A.6(b) of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, would result
in increased costs, extended outage time and additional personnel radiation exposure in order to comply with the
increased Type A test frequency. The establishment of a Corrective Action Plan meets the underlying purpose of the
regulations for maintaining overall containment integrity. This action is similar to that approved for several
other facilities.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption would allow the substitution of a Corrective Action Plan in lieu of an increased test frequency
for containment Type A leakage tests. The purpose of Type A testing is to ensure that the leakage through the primary
reactor containment would not exceed the maximum allowable leakage during a design basis accident. It also provides
assurance that the Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) Program adequately identifies and corrects containment penetrations
requiring repair. The licensee has implemented a Corrective Action Plan to correct LLRT deficiencies which have
been attributed as the cause for previous Type A failures which have led to the increased testing frequency. The approved
Corrective Action Plan will provide equivalent assurance of containment integrity, and will not alter the method
of operation of the facility. The only change will be, on a one-time basis, the frequency for conducting the Type A CILRT.
Therefore, post-accident radiological releases will not exceed previously determined values as a result of the
proposed action. Further, the exemption is not expected to have an impact on plant radiological effluent releases.
The proposed action does have the potential to reduce occupational exposure by reducing the amount of time personnel
are required to spend in a radiologically restricted area.

With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action and related change to the Technical Specifications
involve a change in the surveillance requirements and will not affect non-radiological plant effluents nor does
it have any other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption and amendment. This would not reduce environmental
impacts of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility and greater occupational exposure
to plant personnel.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the Commission's Final
Environmental Statement, dated August 1981, for Fermi 2.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the State of Michigan regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.

Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's application and request for exemption
dated May 24, 1993. This document is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120
L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Monroe County Library System,
3700 South Custer Road, Monroe, Michigan 48161.

<DOCTITLE>Indiana Michigan Power Co.; Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No
Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirement
of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) to Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Berrien County, Michigan.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirement of 10 CFR 55.59)a)(1), which requires that a requalification
program for operator licensees and senior operator licensees be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed 24
months in duration. The licensee has requested an exemption which would allow it to administer the operating portion
of the annual operator requalification examination in the May-June, 1994 timeframe rather than at the end of
the 24-month requalification cycle in February 1994. The licensee's request for exemption and the bases are contained
in its letter dated October 4, 1993.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption is from 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), which requires that a requalification program for operator licensees
and senior operator licensees be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed 24 months in duration. In addition,
an annual requalification examination must be passed. The licensee requested an exemption in order to administer
the operating portion of the requalification examination from the current 24-month cycle approximately 4 months
into the next cycle due to installation of control room modifications. This would be a one-time exemption and the next
examination would be administered on schedule in January 1995, which is consistent with the annual examination requirement
cited in 10 CFR 55.59(a)(2).



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed action would allow rescheduling of a portion of the operator license requalification examinations
from the current 24-month requalification cycle into the next cycle. This exemption would not increase the risk of
facility accidents. Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not be greater than previously determined,
nor does the proposed exemption otherwise affect the quantity of radiological plant effluents, nor result in any
significant increase in occupational exposure. Likewise, the exemption does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Commission's Final Environmental
Statement related to operation of D.C. Cook, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1973.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the State of Michigan regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated October 4, 1993. This letter
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. Washington, DC 20555
and at the local public document room located at the Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St.
Joseph, Michigan 49085.

or utilization facilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted to States by the Clean Air Act.



II. Background



A. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, authorize the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NCR) to license and regulate, among other activities, the manufacture, construction, and
operation of utilization facilities (nuclear power plants) in order to assure common defense and security and to
protect the public health and safety. Under these statutes, the NRC is the responsible agency regulating nuclear
power plant safety.

B. NRC believes that its mission to protect the public health and safety can be served by a policy of cooperation with
State governments and has formally adopted a policy statement on ``Cooperation with States at Commercial Nuclear
Power Plants and Other Nuclear Production or Utilization Facilities'' (54 FR 7530, February 22, 1989). The policy
statement provides that NRC will consider State proposals to enter into instruments of cooperation for certain programs
when these programs have provisions to ensure close cooperation with NRC. This agreement is intended to be consistent
with, and implement the provisions of the NRC's policy statement.

C. NRC fulfills its statutory mandate to regulate nuclear power plant safety by, among other things, responding to
emergencies at licensee's facilities and monitoring the status and adequacy of the licensee's responses to emergency
situations.

D. Kansas fulfills its statutory mandate to provide for preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery in the
event of an accident at a nuclear power plant through the Kansas Department of Health and Environment(KDHE) and the
Kansas Division of Emergency Preparedness(KDEP) of the Adjutant General's Department.



III. Scope



A. This Agreement defines the way in which NRC and KDHE and KDEP will cooperate in planning and maintaining the capability
to transfer reactor plant data via the Emergency Response Data System during emergencies at nuclear power plants
in the State of Kansas.

B. It is understood by the NRC and the State of Kansas that ERDS data will only be transmitted by a licensee during emergencies
classified at the Alert level or above, during scheduled tests, or during exercises when available.

C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict or expand the statutory authority of NRC, the State of Kansas,
or to affect or otherwise alter the terms of any agreement in effect under the authority of Section 274b of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended; nor is anything in this Agreement intended to restrict or expand the authority of the
State of Kansas on matters not within the scope of this Agreement.

D. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the State of Kansas authority to (1) interpret or modify NRC regulations
and NRC requirements imposed on the licensee; (2) take enforcement actions; (3) issue confirmatory letters; (4)
amend, modify, or revoke a license issued by NRC; or (5) direct or recommend nuclear power plant employees to take or
not take any action. Authority for all such actions is reserved exclusively to the NRC.



IV. NRC's General Responsibilities



Under this agreement, NRC is responsible for maintaining the Emergency Response Data System (ERDS). ERDS is a system
designed to receive, store, and retransmit data from in-plant data systems at nuclear power plants during emergencies.
The NRC will provide user access to ERDS data to one user terminal for the State of Kansas during emergencies at nuclear
power plants which have implemented an ERDS interface and for which any portion of the plant's 10 mile Emergency Planning
Zone (EPZ) lies within the State of Kansas. The NRC agrees to provide unique software already available to NRC (not
commercially available) that was developed under NRC contract for configuring an ERDS workstation.



V. Kansas General Responsibilities



A. KDHE will, in cooperation with the NRC, establish a capability to receive ERDS data. To this end, KDHE will provide
the necessary computer hardware and commercially licensed software required for ERDS data transfer to users.

B. KDHE agrees not to use ERDS to access data from nuclear power plants for which a portion of the 10 mile Emergency Planning
Zone does not fall within its State boundary.

<PARENT> FR940214-2-00047 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

C. For the purpose of minimizing the impact on plant operators, clarification of ERDS data will be pursued through
the NRC.



VI. Implementation



KDHE, KDEP, and the NRC agree to work in concert to assure that the following communications and information exchange
protocol regarding the NRC ERDS are followed.

A. KDHE, KDEP, and the NRC agree in good faith to make available to each other information within the intent and scope
of this Agreement.

B. NRC, KDHE and KDEP agree to meet as necessary to exchange information on matters of common concern pertinent to this
Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, such meetings will be held in the NRC Operations Center. The affected utilities
will be kept informed of pertinent information covered by this Agreement.

C. To preclude the premature public release of sensitive information, NRC, KDHE and KDEP will protect sensitive information
to the extent permitted by the Federal Freedom of Information Act, the State Freedom of Information Act, 10 CFR 2.790,
and other applicable authority.

D. NRC will conduct periodic tests of licensee ERDS data links. A copy of the test schedule will be provided to KDHE by
the NRC. KDHE may test its ability to access ERDS data during these scheduled tests, or may schedule independent tests
of the State link with the NRC.

E. NRC will provide access to ERDS for emergency exercises with reactor units capable of transmitting exercise data
to ERDS. For exercises in which the NRC is not participating, KDHE will coordinate with NRC in advance to ensure ERDS
availability. NRC reserves the right to preempt ERDS use for any exercise in progress in the event of an actual event
at any licensed nuclear power plant.



VII. Contacts



A. The principal senior management contacts for this Agreement will be the Director, Division of Operational Assessment,
Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the Chief, Environmental Radiation and Emergency Preparedness
Section, Bureau of Air and Radiation and the Technological Hazards Administrator, Technological Hazards Program,
Kansas Division of Emergency Preparedness, Adjutant General's Department. These individuals may designate appropriate
staff representatives for the purpose of administering this Agreement.

B. Identification of these contacts is not intended to restrict communication between NRC, KDHE and KDEP staff members
on technical and other day-to-day activities.



VIII. Resolution of Disagreements



A. If disagreements arise about matters within the scope of this Agreement, NRC, KDHE and KDEP will work together to
resolve these differences.

B. Resolution of differences between the State and NRC staff over issues arising out of this Agreement will be the initial
responsibility of the NRC Division of Operational Assessment management.

C. Differences which cannot be resolved in accordance with Sections VIII.A and VIII.B will be reviewed and resolved
by the Director, Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data.

D. The NRC's General Counsel has the final authority to provide legal interpretation of the Commission's regulations.



IX. Effective Date



This Agreement will take effect after it has been signed by both parties.



X. Duration



A formal review, not less than 1 year after the effective date, will be performed by the NRC to evaluate implementation
of the Agreement and resolve any problems identified. This Agreement will be subject to periodic reviews and may be
amended or modified upon written agreement by both parties, and may be terminated upon 30 days written notice by either
party.



XI. Separability



If any provision(s) of this Agreement, or the application of any provision(s) to any person or circumstances is held
invalid, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances
will not be affected.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Valley Authority; Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 3</DOCTITLE>




Exemption




I




The Tennessee Valley Authority (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33 and DPT-68,
which authorize operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3. The licenses provide, among other
things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.


These facilities are two boiling water reactors located at the licensee's site in Limestone County, Alabama. One
other boiling water reactor at this site is not affected by this exemption.






II



Title 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against
radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states: ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite
physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance
that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.'' 



Containment access controls specified by 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) require that any time frequent access to the containment
is required, positive controls are maintained by a guard or watchman to assure only authorized personnel or materials
are permitted into the containment.




BFN Units 1 and 3 have been shut down since March 1985 for modifications required to put the units in compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. A substantial number of the required modifications require frequent containment
access. Therefore, the licensee has maintained a guard at a controlled access location to fulfill the requirements
of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8).




BFN Units 1 and 3 have been defueled since September 1985 and February 1987, respectively. In a defueled condition,
the potential radiological hazard associated with postulated accidents for these reactors is very low. Therefore,
on September 2, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) to eliminate the positive containment
access controls until the reactors are refueled. In response to a request for additional information dated December
2, 1993, on December 17, 1993, the licensee provided information verifying the small radiological hazard for the
defueled reactors.




III






Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life
or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide alternate measures for protection against radiological sabotage
provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternate measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet
``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides
protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.





The licensee asserts that these criteria are satisfied and an exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) requirements can
be granted, give the unique status of BFN Units 1 and 3 and the other controls which are or will be exercised to ensure
the reactors are returned to service in a safe manner. Presently, the reactors are defueled, which reduces the radiological
hazard potential within the containment such that sabotage could not create a substantial public radiation dose.
The licensee notes that it will perform extensive return-to-service testing on all safety-related systems. This
testing ensures that plant components can properly perform their intended design functions. After modifications
are completed, the licensee will also perform security inspections to detect sabotage or introduction of foreign
material which may have occurred during the recovery effort.

The licensee's application also discusses measures such as access authorization controls, criminal background
checks, and fitness for duty verification. However, the staff has found that these measures are consistent with minimum
compliance with the regulations, and do not constitute compensatory actions which justify granting the exemption.




IV





As documented in the staff's safety evaluation, given the fact that the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 3 are
defueled for the duration of this exemption, and the licensee's plans for security inspections and return-to-service
testing of equipment provide the same high assurance, meet the general performance requirements, and provide an
overall level of radiological sabotage protection equivalent to continued conformance to the regulation. Accordingly,
the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life
or property or common defense or security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby
grants the licensee an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) for positive containment access controls
on BFN Units 1 and 3 during periods of frequent access until immediately before fuel is loaded. Provisions of 10 CFR
73.55(d)(8) pertaining to other containment access controls shall remain in effect.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 3881, January 27, 1994).
This exemption is effective upon issuance. This exemption expires for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 1 when the
licensee begins to load nuclear fuel in that reactor, and expires for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 3 when the
licensee begins to load nuclear fuel in that reactor.






Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 1st day of February 1994.

Rule 204-1_File No. 270-41.

Rule 204-3_File No. 270-42.




Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted for OMB approval proposed amendments to rule 203-1
and Form ADV, rule 204-1, and rule 204-3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act'').
The amendments pertain to disclosure by investment advisers that sponsor ``wrap fee programs,'' services under
which investment advice and brokerage services are paid for in a single ``wrap'' fee.

The proposed amendments to rule 203-1 and Form ADV would require sponsors of wrap fee programs to prepare and
file with the Commission new Schedule H to Form ADV discussing important information about the wrap fee program. It
is estimated that approximately 300 investment advisers would be required to amend their Form ADVs to include Schedule
H in the first year after the schedule's adoption, and that each adviser completing Schedule H would incur six burden
hours in its preparation. The increase in burden resulting from this amendment will be reflected in the burden associated
with rule 204-1.

In addition, it is estimated that each year approximately thirty investment advisers will be required to complete
Schedule H as part of an initial application for registration on Form ADV, and that each adviser required to complete
Schedule H would incur six burden hours in addition to the time currently necessary to complete Form ADV. This increase
in burden will be reflected in the burden associated with rule 203-1 (Form ADV).

The burden hours associated with rule 204-1 are likely to decline after the amendments' first year. In future
years, each adviser amending its Form ADV would merely need to make any necessary changes to its existing wrap fee brochure.
The Commission estimates that the changes will take significantly less than six hours necessary to prepare the brochure
initially.

The amendments to rule 204-3 would require an adviser to deliver its Schedule H to prospective clients of the
wrap fee program, and offer to deliver it annually to existing clients of the program, in lieu of the disclosure document
required by the rule to be delivered to the adviser's other clients. Because the amendments to rule 204-3 would
merely require the delivery of a specific wrap fee disclosure document to certain clients in lieu of the delivery of
a more general disclosure document, the Commission estimates that the amendments to rule 204-3 will not increase
the burden on advisers in complying with the rule.

General comments may be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated
average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate
Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, and Gary Waxman,
Clearance Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Paperwork Reduction Act numbers 3235-0049;
3235-0048, and 3235-0047, Office of Management and Budget, room 3228, New Executive Office Building,

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Partial Temporary Accelerated Approval to Proposed
Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to a Pilot Program for Execution of Odd-lot Market Orders</DOCTITLE>


February 7, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 27, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On February 4, 1994, the Amex submitted Amendment
No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify the duration of this pilot extension.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Amex proposes to implement on a permanent basis its existing pilot procedures under Exchange Rule 205 requiring
execution of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote with no differential charged. In order to permit the
pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing program be extended
for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with the further opportunity, if necessary,
to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994.






The complete text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be exchanged at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Commission has approved, on a pilot basis extending to February 8, 1994, amendments to Exchange Rule 205 to require
the execution of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote with no odd-lot differential.
 These procedures initially were approved by the Commission on a pilot basis,
 and subsequently were extended seven times.







Under the pilot procedures, odd-lot market orders with no qualifying notations are executed at the Amex quotation
at the time the order is represented in the market, either by being received at the trading post or through the Exchange's
Post Execution Reporting (``PER'') System. Enhancements to the PER system have been implemented to provide for the
automatic execution of odd-lot market orders entered through PER. For purposes of the pilot program, odd-lot limit
orders that are immediately executable based on the Amex quote at the time order is received, at the trading post or
through PER, are executed in the same manner as odd-lot market orders.

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940214-2-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940214-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange proposes that the pilot program applicable to odd-lot execution procedures be approved on a permanent
basis. The Exchange believes that current odd-lot execution procedures under the pilot program have resulted in
superior customer executions, in terms of price and time of execution, compared to previous odd-lot procedures under
Rule 205.
 Odd-lot market orders as well as executable odd-lot limit orders, entered in the Exchange's PER system or directly
with the specialist after a regular opening or a reopening following a trading halt, receive an immediate automatic
execution at the displayed Amex bid or offer; odd-lot market orders entered before the opening or reopening are accumulated
and automatically executed at the price of the opening or reopening transaction without a differential.





Because, except for odd-lot market orders entered prior to the opening, execution of such orders is not based on a subsequent
round-lot transaction, as previous market order procedures under Rule 205 required, the Amex believes odd-lot market
orders (as well as odd-lot limit orders executable at the time entered) are executed without delay at prices reflecting
market conditions at the time the order is entered, with the customer receiving a report more quickly. This is particularly
important with respect to odd-lot orders in less frequently traded issues, which, under former Rule 205 procedures,
could have been subject to significant execution delays.

The added system efficiencies and greater timeliness of executions provided by the pilot procedures, together with
the opportunity for improved price executions, have resulted in significant customer benefits compared to prior
procedures.

In order to permit the pilot program to continue without interruption, the Exchange also requests that the existing
program be extended for an additional six month period in order to provide the Commission with further opportunity,
if necessary, to assess the operation of the program beyond February 8, 1994.



2. Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with sections 6(b) and 11A(a)(1) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it facilitates the economically efficient execution of odd-lot transactions,
and is intended to result in improved execution of customer orders.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-93-45
and should be submitted by March 7, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



In regard to the six month extension of the Amex's odd-lot execution pilot program, the Commission, for the same rationale
discussed in its previous orders regarding these procedures,
 finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular with the requirements of sections 6(b)
 and 11A(a)(1)
 of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission believes that the revised procedures, which provide
for pricing of odd-lot market orders at the prevailing Amex quote rather than at the execution price of a subsequent
transaction, should provide investors with more timely execution of these orders. Moreover, these orders should
receive less costly executions than under the former procedures because no differential will be charged. In addition,
the Exchange has implemented enhancements to its PER system for the automatic execution of odd-lot market orders,
as set forth in the Commission's order approving the use of the pilot program procedures.

<TEXT>
 

In its previous orders,
 the Commission asked the Amex to analyze the difference in executions between using the Intermarket Trading System
(``ITS'') consolidated best bid or offer as compared with the Amex quote without the differential. Specifically,
the Commission expressed interest in whether customers are receiving the best execution, both in terms of price and
time, using the new Amex system. The Commission was also interested in the feasibility of implementing an odd-lot
pricing system using the ITS best bid or offer and no differential.






In response, the Amex submitted the requested information with respect to the difference in executions between the
ITS best bid or offer and the Amex quote to the Commission on January 9, 1991, April 22, 1991, October 25, 1991, February
4, 1993, August 3, 1993 and November 16, 1993.
 The Amex data indicated that the pilot procedures provide a superior execution for a substantial majority of odd-lot
executions. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot for an additional six
months to enable the Commission to review fully the Amex reports and to enable the pilot to continue without interruption
during the Commission's review. The Commission, however, remains concerned that some odd-lot orders could receive
executions at less than the best available price since the Exchange's pricing formula does not include quotations
from other markets.
 Nevertheless, due to the relatively low number of odd-lot market orders on the Amex,
 the percentage of Amex quotes that are worse than the ITS best bid or offer, and the benefits to customers under the pilot
program procedures as compared to the former pricing procedures, the Commission believes that it is acceptable to
continue the pilot's current pricing procedures for an additional six months. During that period, the Commission
requests that the Exchange continue to monitor the pilot and provide data on the number of Amex quotes executed that
are worse than the ITS consolidated best bid and offer and on the number of odd-lots as a percentage of total Exchange
share volume and of the total number of trades. Moreover, the Commission remains interested in the feasibility of
implementing an odd-lot pricing system using the ITS best bid and offer and no differential. Accordingly, the Commission
requests that the Amex include in its monitoring report the feasibility and cost of developing such a plan, along with
a projected time frame for potential implementation. The Commission requests that the Amex submit its report on these
matters by May 8, 1994.






The Commission finds good cause for granting partial temporary approval of the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue on an uninterrupted
basis. In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are the identical procedures that were
published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.







It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2)
 of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-93-45) is approved for a six month period ending
on August 8, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the
Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988</DOCTITLE>



February 7, 1994




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on November 8, 1993, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and
III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On January 13, 1994, the BSE submitted
to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The BSE seeks to amend its rules to supplement the provisions of the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement
Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA'').






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change





In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.





A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to supplement section 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
and the ITSFEA, by requiring every member organization of the Exchange to establish maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by such member
and any person associated with the member. In addition, it requires that all members who are required to file SEC Form
X-17A-5 (``FOCUS Reports'') with the Exchange on an annual basis must submit with their FOCUS Reports
a signed statement of compliance with this rule. Finally, it establishes minimum standards for compliance with the
record-keeping requirements of this rule, and requires disclosure by members and associated persons to the Exchange's
Surveillance Department of any securities transaction that the firm reasonably believes may have involved the misuse
of material, non-public information.


Supplementary Material .02 defines conduct that would constitute the misuse of material, non-public information,
including, but not limited to, (1) trading in any securities, or in any related securities, options or other derivative
securities of a corporation while in possession of material non-public information concerning that corporation;
(2) trading in any underlying security or related options or other derivative securities concerning imminent transactions
in the underlying security or related securities; and (3) disclosing to another person or entity information described
in (1) or (2) above for the purpose of facilitating the misuse of such material, non-public information.

The scope of the aforementioned definition is intended to be consistent with the goal of section 15(f) of the Act and
ITSFEA to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information. This definition should be broad enough to encompass
frontrunning, trading on the basis of material corporate inside information, tipping and misappropriating material
corporate inside information.

Supplementary Material .02 defines the term ``associated person'' or ``person associated with a member'' as any
partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a member (or any person occupying a similar status or performing
similar functions), any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
a member, or any employee of a member.

Supplementary Material .03 requires members to establish, maintain and enforce certain policies and procedures
pursuant to this rule. Specifically, members would be required to (1) advise all associated persons in writing of
the prohibition against the misuse of material, non-public information; (2) maintain for at least three years, the
first two years in an easily accessible place, signed statements from the member and all associated persons of the
member, affirming their awareness of and agreement to abide by the above mentioned prohibitions; (3) maintain for
at least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, account statements of all brokerage accounts
(excluding mutual fund and money market accounts) in which an associated person either has a direct or indirect interest
or makes investment decisions; (4) periodically review all such brokerage accounts for the purpose of detecting
those securities transactions that the firm reasonably believes may have involved the misuse of material, non-public
information; and (5) identify and document business dealings the member may have with publicly traded corporations
that may result in the member receiving material, non-public information.The standards contained in .03 are intended
to be minimum standards for compliance with the record-keeping requirements of the Act and this rule. Adherence to
these standards will not necessarily constitute compliance with the Act and the rule for all members. The adequacy
of any one member's policies and procedures will depend on the nature of that member's business.

Supplementary Material .04 and the member bulletin (see Exhibit 3) describe a set of forms, denominated as the ``Sample
ITSFEA Compliance Procedures,'' which may be used by ``eligible members'' to satisfy the record-keeping and filing
requirements of the Act and this rule. ``Eligible members,'' are member organizations and sole Exchange members
that do not carry or introduce customer accounts and for whom the Exchange is the designated examining authority (``DEA'').

Specifically, the Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures require: (1) All associated persons to disclose each securities
account in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest, or make investment decisions; (2) all associated
persons to disclose whether they are an officer, director or 10% shareholder in a company whose shares are publicly
traded: (3) acknowledgement by all associated persons that they understand and will abide by the prohibition against
the misuse of material, non-public information; (4) written statement by a senior officer, partner or sole proprietor
that such person ensures that all of the ITSFEA compliance procedures are being followed, including the periodic
review of all accounts and trading activities of associated persons.

The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures are intended to constitute the minimum policies and procedures required
by the Act and this rule; their use does not ensure compliance with the record-keeping and filing requirements.

The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade through the prevention of fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago
Stock Exchange, Inc. to Establish a Temporary Policy Relating to the Automatic Execution Feature of the Midwest Automated
Execution System.</DOCTITLE>



February 8, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 26, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On February 3, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CHX has published to its members a temporary policy
 relating to the automatic execution feature of the Midwest Automated Execution (``MAX'') System which, 

inter alia

, automates The Exchange's Guaranteed Execution System (``BEST System'') pursuant to Article XX, Rule 37 of the CHX
Rules.







II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule charge. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Recently, the Exchange has experienced an abnormal influx of orders through the MAX system at the same time that a certain
analyst' report is broadcast on cable T.V. Because of the near instantaneous automatic execution feature of the MAX
system, the executions of those orders are taking place before the quotes for those stocks can be updated to reflect
the analyst's comments.

The MAX system automates the requirements of Rule 37 of Article XX which guarantees executions at the best market up
to a certain size for agency orders. Paragraph 7 under Rule 37 allows specialists and floor brokers to seek relief from
the requirements of the BEST system in unusual trading situations.
 The Committee on Floor Procedures has determined that the broadcast of the above described report creates unusual
trading situations that warrant relief from the automatic execution feature for a short period of time so that proper
quotes can be entered. As a result, the purpose of the proposed rule change is to published the Committee on Floor Procedure's
determination to all trading floor members.







2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.




C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others




The proposed rule change has been endorsed by the Exchange's Floor Procedures Committee.






III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action





The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration
or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange and therefore has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)
of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed
rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.






IV. Solicitation of Comments





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice
of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change Relating to Waiver
of Maximum Bid/Ask Differentials in Individual Equity Options</DOCTITLE>


February 7, 1994


On February 9, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to permit two Floor Officials to waive, on a case-by-case basis, the required maximum bid/ask
differentials for options when the bid/ask differential in the security underlying an options contract is greater
than one-half of a point. Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 23, 1993.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. On February 7, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1
to the proposed rule change.
 This order approves the proposal.







The Exchange proposes to amend its rule establishing the maximum bid/ask differentials that may be created in making
a market in options contracts. Rule 6.37(b)(1) currently provides, for example, that a Market Maker may bid and/or
offer so as to create differences of no more than one-quarter of a point between the bid and the offer when the bid is less
than $2. The current rule also provides, however, that the Exchange's Options Floor Trading Committee (``Committee'')
 may establish maximum spreads other than those specified. Additionally, Rule 6.37(b)(1) also currently provides
that in the event the bid/ask differential in the underlying security is greater than the bid/ask differential contained
in the rule, the permissible price differential for any in-the-money option series may be identical to those in the
underlying security market.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940214-2-00092 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940214-2-00055 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the proposal, the last sentence from Rule 6.37(b)(1), which provides an exemption from the maximum specified
bid/ask differentials for in-the-money options series in certain circumstances, would be moved to Rule 6.37(b)(3).
 Additionally, new language is proposed to be added to Rule 6.37(b)(3) which would allow two Floor Officials to waive
the requirements of Rule 6.37(b)(1) for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options series, on a case-by-case basis,
when the bid/ask differential for the underlying security is greater than one-half of a point. In such instances,
the spreads for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options series may be, at most, one-half as wide as the bid/ask
differential in the underlying security in the primary market. The proposed rule also provides that exemptions granted
pursuant to the rule are subject to Committee review.





The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
 In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is designed to facilitate transactions in securities,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and to promote
just and equitable principles of trade. Specifically, by incorporating objective standards into the rule and providing
Floor Officials with the discretion to grant exemptions when those standards are met, the proposal will give Market
Makers more flexibility to apply to alter the maximum bid/ask differential when quoting options where the market
in the underlying security is illiquid and therefore has wider spreads. The Commission notes that under the current
rule, Market Makers may already obtain approval to alter the spreads specified in the rule for any options series.
Such approval, however, must be obtained from the Committee at either a regular or special meeting of the Committee.
 The proposal would alleviate any potential delay in granting Market Makers requests to adjust their spreads by permitting
such relief to be granted by two Floor Officials rather than the full Committee.






Although the Commission recognizes that the proposal could result in more requests by Market Makers to obtain permission
to increase maximum spreads because such requests could be granted by two Floor Officials as opposed to the full Committee,
the Commission believes that the rule ensures that exemptions can only be granted in limited circumstances. First,
an exemption can only be granted for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options series where the spread in the underlying
security is greater than one-half of a point. Second, even with the exemption for the bid/ask differentials for at-the-money
and out-of-the-money options series, the maximum spread for those series can be at most, one-half as wide as the spread
in the underlying security. Finally, any exemption granted by the Floor Officials will be subject to Committee review.
This review authority will allow the full Committee to monitor the use of the exemptions and to detect any situations
where, for example, exemptions have been improperly granted by certain Floor Officials, and to take appropriate
steps to prevent subsequent abuses of the rule.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies that the intent of the proposed rule change is to provide objective standards for
allowing Floor Officials to grant exemptions from Rule 6.37(b)(1) for at-the-money and out-of-the-money options
series, not to change the current rule with respect to the exemption for in-the-money options series. Moreover, the
Commission notes that this proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period and no comments were received
by the Commission. Therefore, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5)
 and 19(b)(2)
 of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on an accelerated basis.






Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All written submissions should
refer to File No. SR-PSE-93-03 and should be submitted by March 7, 1994.



It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-93-03) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Regarding Unbundling of PACE Orders</DOCTITLE>



February 8, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 3, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On February 1, 1994, the Phlx submitted Amendment
No. 1 to the proposal.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to adopt Commentary .19 to Phlx Rule 229
 to prohibit the unbundling of orders entered for execution through the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication
and Execution System (``PACE'').
 Specifically, Commentary .19 would read as follows:





Orders received by a member from a customer may not be unbundled for the purpose of availing upon PACE volume and size
execution guarantees, nor may a firm solicit a customer to unbundle an order the purpose of availing upon PACE volume
and size execution guarantees.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Phlx proposes to adopt Commentary .19 to Phlx Rule 229 in order to prohibit the unbundling of certain types of orders.
PACE is the Exchange's automated order routing, delivery and execution system for equity securities. Pursuant to
Phlx Rule 229, customer orders entered through PACE are entitled to certain execution guarantees. For example, limit
orders for less than 600 shares become due an execution once 1,000 shares of that security prints at the limit price
or better on the New York Stock Exchange (``primary market guarantee'').






Unbundling occurs when a member organization or its agent splits a larger sized order into two or more small-sized
orders to take advantage of PACE execution guarantees for orders of less than 600 shares. The Phlx proposal would prohibit
members from soliciting their customers to unbundle orders for the purpose of taking advantage of these guarantees.
However, the proposed prohibition against unbundling does not extend to any orders broken up by a non-member customer
at his or her own discretion as long as the customer was not solicited to do so by the Phlx member firm for the aforementioned
purpose.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with section 6(b)(5),
in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, as well as to protect investors and
the public interest, consistent with section 6(b)(5).

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


The Phlx has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.


 III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:



(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Person making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public

Supplementary Information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. First Transamerica is a stock life insurance company incorporated under te laws of New York in 1986.
2. The Separate Account was established by First Transamerica on November 10, 1993. Schwab will serve as the distributor
and principal underwriter of the Contracts.
3. The Contract is a flexible purchase payment deferred variable annuity which can be purchased on a non-tax qualified
basis or used as a funding vehicle in connection with certain retirement plans which qualify for favorable income
tax treatment. Purchase payments under the Contracts will be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate
Account. The initial purchase payment under a Contract must be at least $5,000. Additional purchase payments of at
least $1,000 each may be made at any time before the annuity date.
4. Each Contract contains death benefit provisons that provide a benefit equal to the greatest of (a) the sum of all
purchase payments, less the sum of all withdrawals and any applicable premium or similar taxes, or (b) the account
value, as of the end of the valuation period during which the later of (1) due proof of death is received and (2) the receipt
of a written notice of the method of settlement elected by the beneficiary.
5. A Transfer fee of $10 will be deducted under the Contract for each transfer in excess of 10 per Contract year. First
Transamerica will also deduct an annual Contract charge of $25 for each Contract at the end of each Contract Year for
administrative services. While First Transamerica does not currently impose an Administrative Expense Charge,
it reserves the right to deduct such a charge on a daily basis in the future from the assets of the Separate Account. However,
the Administrative Expense Charge is guaranteed not to exceed an effective annual rate of 0.15% of the average net
assets held in each sub-account. First Transamerica does not anticipate any profit from these charges. First Transamerica
will deduct the administrative charges in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.
6. First Transamerica will deduct any premium taxes related to a particular Contract from purchase payments, upon
surrender, or upon annuitization, in reliance on Rule 26a-2 under the 1940 Act. No charges are currently made
for federal, state, or local taxes other than premium taxes. However, First Transamerica may deduct such taxes in
the future.
7. There are no charges or deductions for sales load from purchase payments, Separate Account assets, or upon withdrawal
of surrender of a Contract. First Transamerica will incur expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts which will
be paid from its general assets.

8. For assuming certain mortality and expenses risks under the Contracts, First Transamerica will assess a mortality
and expense risk charge at an annual rate of 0.85% of the value of net assets in the Separate Account. Of this amount,
approximately 0.30% represents mortality risk and approximately 0.55% is estimated to be attributable to expense
risks. This charge will not increase. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs
and assumed risks, the loss will fall on First Transamerica. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover
costs, any excess will be profit to First Transamerica. First Transamerica currently anticipates a profit from this
charge. According to Applicants, the mortality risk borne by First Transamerica arises from its contractual obligation
to make annuity payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the
Contract) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that
neither an annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the periodic
annuity payments. First Transamerica also assumes a risk in connection with the payment of death benefits, since
the death benefit could be higher than the account value. The expense risk assumed by First Transamerica is the risk
that administrative costs will be greater than anticipated, or exceed the amount recovered through the administrative
charges.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act require that all payments received under a periodic payment plan
certificate be held by a qualified trustee or a custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to
the depositor or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the
Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants request exemptions from
those Sections to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the charge for mortality and expenses risks in the
manner described in the application.

2. Applicants submit that First Transamerica is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality
and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent
with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. As described above, in return
for this amount First Transamerica assumes certain risks under the Contracts. The mortality and expense risk charge
is a reasonable charge to compensate First Transamerica for the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live
longer than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts, for the risk that death
benefit proceeds will be greater than the Account Value, and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater
than anticipated or exceed amounts derived from the administrative charges.

3. First Transamerica represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon First Transamerica's
analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors
as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, death benefit guarantees, guaranteed annuity
rates and other policy options. First Transamerica will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the
Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results
of, its comparative survey.

4. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses. First Transamerica represents that there is
a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account
and the Contract owners. Applicants also represent that the basis for this conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by First Transamerica at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.

5. First Transamerica represents that the Separate Account will only invest in management investment companies
which undertake, in the event any such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses,
to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate
and approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections
26(a)(2))C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

<DOCTITLE>Lincoln Benefit Life Co., et al.; Application for Exemption</DOCTITLE>



February 7, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or the ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Lincoln Benefit Life Company (``Lincoln Benefit''), Lincoln Benefit Life Variable Annuity Account (the ``Account'')
and Lincoln Benefit Financial Services, Inc. (``Lincoln Financial'') (collectively, ``Applicants'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Amended order requested under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an amended order permitting them to deduct a daily charge from the assets of the Account for mortality
and expense risks in connection with the offering of certain variable annuity contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application, the complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.



Applicants' Representations



1. By order dated September 29, 1993 (Investment Company Act Release No. 19747) (the ``Order''), the Commission,
pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, provided Applicants exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act. The exemptions were granted, to the extent necessary, to allow Applicant to deduct from the Account
the mortality and expense risk charge imposed under certain flexible premium individual deferred variable annuity
contracts (the ``Contracts'') funded through the Account.

2. Applicants request that the Order be amended. Specifically, Applicants propose modification of the death benefit
under the Contracts. Currently, the death benefit provides for, among other things, interest accumulations at four
percent prior to the Contract owner's attained age 80. Applicants propose that the death benefit be modified to provide
instead for such accumulations prior to the Contract anniversary next following the Contract owner's 75th birthday.
Applicants request that the Order be amended to the extent necessary to recognize the proposed modification to the
Contracts.

3. Lincoln Benefit, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Nebraska, is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Allstate Life Insurance Company. Allstate Life Insurance Company is an Illinois corporation wholly owned indirectly
by The Allstate Corporation. Approximately 80.1 percent of the common stock of The Allstate Corporation is indirectly
owned by Sears, Roebuck & Co.

4. The Account, established by Lincoln Benefit on August 3, 1992 as a segregated asset account under Nebraska law,
serves as a funding medium for the Contracts. The application states that the Account meets the definition of a ``separate
account'' under the federal securities laws. The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a
unit investment trust. The application incorporates by reference the registration statement, currently on file
with the Commission (File No. 33-66786), for the Account.

5. Lincoln Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln Benefit, is the distributor of the Contracts. Lincoln
Financial is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a member of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
6. The Contracts are available for retirement plans which qualify for federal tax advantages under the Internal Revenue
Code and for those plans which do not qualify for advantageous treatment. The Contracts require a minimum initial
premium payment of $1,200. Additional premium payments must be in amounts of at least $100.
7. If the owner of a Contract dies prior to the annuity date and the Contract is in force, Lincoln Benefit will, upon receipt
of due proof of death, pay a death benefit. At a minimum, the death benefit is equal to the greater of: (a) All purchase
payments less prior withdrawals, accumulated at 4% per year prior to the Contract anniversary next following the
Contract owner's 75th birthday, and at 0% per year thereafter (the ``Floor Value''); or (b) the Contract value less
applicable premium tax.
 If the Contract value on the seventh Contract anniversary is greater than the Floor Value, the Floor Value will be increased
to the level of the Contract value. If this increase occurs, Floor Value for the eighth Contract year and for subsequent
years will then be calculated using the increased value. The Contract owner may select the form of annuity from four
annuity options described in the registration statement for the Account.




8. One transfer among subaccounts is permitted monthly without charge. For each transfer among subaccounts in excess
of once monthly, a transfer fee of $25 is assessed. The transfer fee is deducted from Contract values which remain in
the subaccount or subaccounts from which the transfer is made. Applicants represent that the transfer fee is designed
to be at cost with no margin included for profit. Lincoln Benefit is currently waiving this fee.
9. Applicants impose an annual Contract maintenance charge of $25 per Contract year. Applicants guarantee that this
charge will not increase and state that the charge reimburses Lincoln Benefit for expenses incurred in maintaining
the Contracts. This charge will be deducted on each Contract anniversary prior to the annuity date, but is not imposed
during the annuity period. If a Contract is surrendered, the charge is assessed as of the surrender date without proration.
10. Lincoln Benefit deducts an administrative expense charge equal to an annual effective rate of .15% of the net asset
value of the subaccount. The application states that this charge will compensate Lincoln Benefit for administering
the Contracts and the Account. This charge is assessed during both the accumulation and the annuity periods. Applicants
state that the Contract maintenance charge and the administrative expense charge are designed, in the aggregate,
to be at cost with no margin included for profit.
11. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% of the amount withdrawn is imposed on certain
surrenders or withdrawals of Contract value. No Sales Charge is applied on annuitization or on the payment of a death
benefit unless the settlement option chosen is payment over a period certain of less than five years. The Sales Charge
is deducted from the Contract value remaining after withdrawal so that the reduction in Contract value as a result
of a withdrawal will be greater than the withdrawal amount requested. Amounts obtained from imposition of the Sales
Charge will be used to pay sales commissions and other promotional or distribution expenses associated with the marketing
of the Contracts. To the extent that the Sales Charge does not cover all sales commissions and other promotional or
distribution expenses, Applicants state that Lincoln Benefit may use any of its corporate assets, including potential
profit from the mortality and expense risk charge, to make up the shortfall.

12. Lincoln Benefit will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
of the Account to compensate Lincoln Benefit for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the
Contracts. Approximately .85% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable
to expense risk. Applicants represent that the charge for mortality and expense risks will not increase. If the mortality
and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risk, Lincoln Benefit will bear the loss.
Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to Lincoln Benefit. If Lincoln Benefit realizes
a gain from the charge for mortality and expense risks, the amount of such gain may be used in the discretion of Lincoln
Benefit.
13. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Lincoln Benefit consists of: (a) Bearing the risk that the life
expectancy of an annuitant will be greater than that assumed in the guaranteed annuity purchase rates; (b) waiving
the Sales Charge upon the death of a Contract owner; and (c) providing a death benefit prior to the annuity date. Applicants
state that the expense risk assumed by Lincoln Benefit is the risk that the costs of administering the Contracts and
the Account will exceed amounts received by Lincoln Benefit through imposition of the Contract maintenance charge
and the administrative expense charge.


Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions


1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, issue an amended order granting
exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the
daily charge for the mortality and expense risk. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part,
prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic
payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified
bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping
and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.
2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Lincoln Benefit under the Contracts.
3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Lincoln Benefit is
within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation
is based upon their analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking into consideration
such factors as: Current charge levels; charge level guarantees; benefits provided; and guaranteed annuity rates.
Applicants represent that Lincoln Benefit will maintain at its home office, available to the Commission, a memorandum
setting forth in detail the methodology used in determining that the level of risk charge is within the range of industry
practice.
4. Applicants represent that Lincoln Benefit has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed
distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion
is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Lincoln Benefit and will be made available to the Commission.
5. Lincoln Benefit also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have
such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons
of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act.


Conclusion


Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

to extend the relief to Smith Barney Shearson and certain investment companies for which Smith Barney Shearson serves
as investment adviser or principal underwriter.

Applicants' Representations



1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company that was organized as a business trust under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts on October 17, 1991. To date, the Trust consists of four series: Smith Barney Shearson
Limited Maturity Treasury Fund, Smith Barney Shearson Limited Maturity Municipals Fund, Smith Barney Shearson
Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, and Smith Barney Shearson Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals
Fund (the ``Funds'').

2. On March 12, 1993, American Express Company and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Shearson, entered into
an asset purchase agreement with Primerica Corporation and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. Inc. (as renamed, Smith Barney Shearson). Under the agreement, American Express sold substantially
all of the assets of Shearson and the Asset Management Divisions of Shearson to Smith Barney Shearson and its designated
affiliates. Upon the closing of the sale on July 31, 1993, Smith Barney Shearson became the sponsor and distributor
of the Trust and Greenwich Street Advisers Division of Mutual Management Corporation, an affiliate of Smith Barney
Shearson, replaced Shearson Lehman Advisors as the Trust's investment adviser.

3. Prior to the sale transaction, investment companies sponsored by Shearson, including the Trust, received orders
of exemption from various provisions of the Act. At the request of Shearson and Smith Barney, the Commission's Division
of Investment Management informed Shearson and Smith Barney that the Division would not recommend that the Commission
take any enforcement action against them if the Funds operate under the terms of a prior order until the earlier of (a)
the date the prior order is renewed by the Commission pursuant to a renewal order specifying Smith Barney and its subsidiaries
or affiliates as applicants or (b) June 8, 1994.
 This application is being filed pursuant to that no-action letter to continue and renew an order that permitted the
Trust to assess a CDSC on redemptions of the Trust's shares (the ``Income Trust Order'').







4. Applicants further request that any relief granted extend to Smith Barney Shearson and any future series of the
Trust or any other open-end investment company for which Smith Barney Shearson, or any entity controlled by, or under
common control with Smith Barney Shearson, serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter that issues shares
that are identical in all material respects to those described in the application.

5. Under the Income Trust Order, the Trust (a) offers shares subject to a maximum sales charge upon purchase of 1.25%
(the ``Upfront Charge'') that is reduced on purchases of $50,000 or more; (b) has instituted a shareholder servicing
plan in accordance with rule 12b-1 under the Act; and (c) assesses a 1% CDSC on certain redemptions of shares made
within one year of their purchase. Under the amended order, the CDSC would continue to be imposed on that portion of
a redemption that causes the current value of Fund shares to fall below the total dollar amount of payments for the purchase
of those shares (less any applicable Upfront Charge) made by the shareholder during the preceding year.

6. No CDSC would be imposed to the extent that the net asset value of the shares redeemed does not exceed (a) the current
net asset value of shares purchased more than one year prior to the redemption (``Old Shares Value''), plus (b) the
current net asset value of shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distribution (``Reinvestment
Shares Value''), plus (c) increases in the net asset value of the shares above purchase payments (less any applicable
Upfront Charge) made during the preceding year (``Appreciation Value'').

7. In effecting a particular redemption request of shares made by a shareholder, the Trust would continue first to
redeem an amount that represents Appreciation Value. The Trust next would redeem an amount that represents Reinvestment
Shares Value, and then an amount that represents Old Shares Value. The amount by which a redemption exceeds the total
of Appreciation Value, Reinvestment Shares Value, and Old Shares Value would be subject to the CDSC.

8. In no event would the maximum amount of the CDSC assessed upon the redemption of shares plus the amount of any Upfront
Charge paid with respect to the shares exceed the maximum sales charge that could have been imposed at the time the shares
were purchased under Article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice adopted by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, of which Smith Barney Shearson is a member.

9. Under the amended order, the CDSC would be waived with respect to: (a) Automatic cash withdrawals by a shareholder
in amounts equal to or less than 2% per month of the value of the shareholder's shares at the time that the shareholder's
participation in the withdrawal plan commences; (b) redemptions in connection with: (i) lump-sum or other distributions
from a qualified corporate or self-employed retirement plan following retirement, termination of employment,
death, disability or following attainment of age 591/2 of a plan participant, (ii) the hardship of a plan participant
to the extent permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''), (iii) a loan made by a qualified corporate
or self-employed retirement plan to a participating employee, (iv) distributions and withdrawals from retirement
plans or individual retirement accounts (``IRAs'') or custodial accounts under section 403(b)(7) of the Code following
attainment of age 591/2; and (v) a tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA; (c) redemptions of shares that
are acquired as a result of an exchange into any Fund from any fund in the same ``group of investment companies'' as defined
in rule 11a-3 under the Act as the Trust and that are sold subject to a sales charge upon purchase (the ``Exchange
Group of Funds''); (d) involuntary redemptions; and (e) redemptions by (i) employees of Travelers Inc. (formerly
known as Primerica Corporation) and its subsidiaries (including Smith Barney Shearson), American Express and its
subsidiaries, and The Boston Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, IRAs for those employees, employee benefit plans
for those employees, and the spouses and minor children of those employees, (ii) accounts managed by investment advisory
subsidiaries of Travelers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and (iii) directors, trustees or
general partners of any investment company for which Smith Barney Shearson serves as distributor. In accordance
with rule 11a-3 under the Act, a CDSC will not be imposed on exchanges between a Fund and any fund in the Exchange
Group of Funds.




10. Under the amended order, a shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund and who reinvests all or part of the redemption
proceeds in shares of any other Fund within 180 days of the redemption will continue to receive a proportionate credit
(in the form of additional shares of the Fund into which the reinvestment is being made) for the CDSC imposed on the prior
redemption. Also, a shareholder who has redeemed shares of a Fund and who reinvests all or part of the redemption proceeds
within 30 days of the redemption in shares of any fund in the Exchange Group of Funds will continue to receive a proportionate
credit (in the form of additional shares of the fund into which the reinvestment is being made) for any CDSC imposed
on the prior redemption. In each case, the amount of the credit would be funded by Smith Barney Shearson out of a ``house''
account into which Smith Barney Shearson would maintain, on an ongoing basis, a portion of the proceeds from CDSCs
assessed to shareholders. The account will at all times be maintained in an amount sufficient to provide all credits
to which shareholders are entitled.





Applicant's Legal Analysis





1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d)
of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder to permit the Funds to continue to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of
the shares as described above and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions.
Applicants believe that the contingent nature of the proposed charge places the purchaser in a better position than
if a sales load were imposed at the time of sale, since in the case of the CDSC the shareholder enjoys the possibility
that he or she will have to pay only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicants further believe that
the imposition of the CDSC permits the Funds' shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working
for them from the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase.






Applicant's Condition





As a condition of the requested relief, applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under
the Act, as currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. 






For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Co., et al.; Application for Exemption</DOCTITLE>



February 7, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company (``Transamerica'' or the ``Company''), Separate Account VA-5
of Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company (the ``Separate Account''), and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.,
(``Schwab'') (collectively referred to herein as ``Applicants'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTION: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) thereof.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of a mortality and expense
risk charge imposed under certain individual and group flexible purchase payment deferred variable annuity contracts
(the ``Contracts'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Transamerica is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of California in 1906.

2. The Separate Account was established by Transamerica on September 28, 1993. Schwab will serve as the distributor
and principal underwriter of the Contracts.

3. The Contract is a flexible purchase payment deferred variable annuity which can be purchased on a non-tax qualified
basis or used as a funding vehicle in connection with certain retirement plans which qualify for favorable income
tax treatment. Purchase payments under the Contracts will be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate
Account. The initial purchase payment under a Contract must be at least $5,000. Additional purchase payments of at
least $1,000 each may be made at any time before the annuity date.

4. Each Contract contains death benefit provisions that provide a benefit equal to the greatest of (a) the sum of all
purchase payments, less the sum of all withdrawals and any applicable premium or similar taxes, or (b) the account
value, as of the end of the valuation period during which the later of (1) due proof of death is received and (2) the receipt
of a written notice of the method of settlement elected by the beneficiary.

5. A Transfer fee of $10 will be deducted under the Contract for each transfer in excess of 10 per Contract year. Transamerica
will also deduct an annual Contract charge of $25 for each Contract at the end of each Contract Year for administrative
services. While Transamerica does not currently impose an Administrative Expense Charge, it reserves the right
to deduct such a charge on a daily basis in the future from the assets of the Separate Account. However, the Administrative
Expense Charge is guaranteed not to exceed an effective annual rate of 0.15% of the average net assets held in each sub-account.
Transamerica does not anticipate any profit from these charges. Transamerica will deduct the administrative charges
in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.

<TEXT>
 

6. Transamerica will deduct any premium taxes related to a particular Contract from purchase payments, upon surrender,
or upon annuitization, in reliance on Rule 26a-2 under the 1940 Act. No charges are currently made for federal,
state, or local taxes other than premium taxes. However, Transamerica may deduct such taxes in the future.

7. There are no charges or deductions for sales load from purchase payments, Separate Account assets, or upon withdrawal
or surrender of a Contract. Transamerica will incur expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts which will be paid
from its general assets.

8. For assuming certain mortality and expenses risks under the Contracts, Transamerica will assess a mortality and
expense risk charge at an annual rate of 0.85% of the value of net assets in the Separate Account. Of this amount, approximately
0.30% represents mortality risk and approximately 0.55% is estimated to be attributable to expense risks. This charge
will not increase. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks,
the loss will fall on Transamerica. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will
be profit to Transamerica. Transamerica currently anticipates a profit from this charge. According to Applicants,
the mortality risk borne by Transamerica arises from its contractual obligation to make annuity payments (determined
in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contract) regardless of how long all annuitants
or any individual annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an annuitant's own longevity, nor an
improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the periodic annuity payments. Transamerica also
assumes a risk in connection with the payment of death benefits, since the death benefit could be higher than the account
value. The expense risk assumed by Transamerica is the risk that administrative costs will be greater than anticipated,
or exceed the amount recovered through the administrative charges.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act require that all payments received under a periodic payment plan
certificate be held by a qualified trustee or a custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to
the depositor or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the
Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants request exemptions from
those Sections to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the charge for mortality and expenses risks in the
manner described in the application.

2. Applicants submit that Transamerica is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and
expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent
with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. As described above, in return
for this amount Transamerica assumes certain risks under the Contracts. The mortality and expense risk charge is
a reasonable charge to compensate Transamerica for the risk that annuitants under the Contracts will live longer
than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts, for the risk that death benefit
proceeds will be greater than the Account Value, and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than
anticipated or exceed amounts derived from the administrative charges.

3. Transamerica represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for
comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon Transamerica's analysis
of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current
charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, death benefit guarantees, guaranteed annuity rates and
other policy options. Transamerica will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a
memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its
comparative survey.

4. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses. Transamerica represents that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract
owners. Applicants also represent that the basis for this conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by Transamerica at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.

5. Transamerica represents that the Separate Account will only invest in management investment companies which
undertake, in the event any such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to
have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and
approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Property Claims Against the Government of Hungary



The Department of State has recently received the following information from the Government of Hungary about filing
claims for property restitution or compensation under Hungary's domestic laws remedying illegal expropriation.

The Hungarian Parliament has reopened the period within which claims for property restitution or compensation may
be filed with the Government of Hungary under existing Hungarian property restitution laws. Persons who did not recover
under these laws because of their failure to file by the previous deadlines may now file a claim for compensation or
restitution with appropriate Hungarian authorities. These claims must be filed between February 15, 1994 and March
15, 1994.

Apart from the new filing period, Hungary's property restitution laws remain unchanged. They continue to provide
only partial compensation or restitution in the form of property coupons, and eligibility remains limited to persons
who meet certain citizenship requirements.

Persons desiring further information about these developments or assistance relating to the filing of a claim under
Hungary's domestic laws should contact the Hungarian Embassy, 3910 Shoemaker Street, NW., Washington, DC 20008.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, and
HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 581, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property
that HUD reviewed in 1993 for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information
provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property
controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. 



Under 24 CFR 581.3(b), landholding agencies are required to notify HUD by December 31, 1993, the current availability
status and classification of each property controlled by the Agencies that were published by HUD as suitable and available
which remain available for application for use by the homeless. 

Under 24 CFR 581.8(d), HUD publishes a list of those properties reported by the Agencies and a list of suitable/unavailable
properties including the reasons why they are not available. 

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
