ACTION:

 Notice of public meetings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's Standing and Special Reef Fish and the Standing and Special Shrimp
Scientific and Statistical Committees will hold public meetings on March 4, 1994, at the Radisson Inn New Orleans
Airport, 2150 Veterans Memorial Boulevard, Kenner, Louisiana; telephone: (504) 467-3111. The Standing and
Special Reef Fish Scientific and Statistical Committee meeting will be held from 10 a.m to 12:30 p.m. 



The purpose of the meeting is to review proposed Draft Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery
of the Gulf of Mexico. Draft Amendment 9 includes management measures to collect historical landings data from fishermen,
to extend the reef fish permit moratorium and the red snapper endorsement system, and to provide partial red snapper
endorsements in 1995 to historical captains if the red snapper endorsement system is extended. The historical landings
data will be used to establish the eligibility of fishermen if a system to limit access to the red snapper fishery is
implemented based on individual transferable quotas (ITQs) or license limitations. Individuals would be notified
of their potential allocation. 


The Standing and Special Shrimp Scientific and Statistical Committee meeting will be held from 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m.


The purpose of that meeting is to review Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf
of Mexico which proposes to: 

(1) Define overfishing for white shrimp; 

(2) Provide for a framework adjustment for the overfishing definitions for brown, white, and pink shrimp; 

(3) Revise the overfishing definition for royal red 
shrimp; and 

(4) Eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing to allow the domestic fleet to harvest the entire optimum
yield. 
The Standing Scientific and Statistical Committee meeting will be held from 3 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. for consideration
of operation procedures.

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As part of the worldwide reorganization of its force structure, the Army proposes to station heavy (armored or mechanized)
combat units at Fort Lewis, Washington. This Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) analyzes two stationing
alternatives (one or two brigades) and the No Action Alternative. The One-Brigade Alternative results in approximately
4,000 additional troops and 500 tracked vehicles. Under the Two-Brigade Alternative, approximately 10,400 additional
troops and 1,100 tracked vehicles would be assigned to Fort Lewis and its sub-installation, Yakima Training Center
(YTC). New construction would be required to support either stationing alternative.



The FEIS will be available for public review during a 30-day post-filing waiting period prior to the Army making the
final decision on the stationing of mechanized and armored combat forces at Fort Lewis.

Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.; Filing



February 10, 1994.



Take notice that on January 13, 1994, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation (CH&E) tendered for filing
an amendment to FERC Contract No. 26 dated August 26, 1993 between CHG&E and New York State Electric and Gas Corporation
(NYSEG). The amended contract provides for an increase in the facilities charge associated with investment at the
Smithfield Substation due to the replacement of a motor-operated manually controlled air break switch with a supervisory
controlled circuit breaker.

The facilities charge increases from $57.00 per month to $2,410.00 per month and is retroactive to August 16, 1991
the date on which the circuit breaker was placed in service. The update to the facilities charge was delayed until final
closure of the Work Order for the system modifications.

CHG&E requests waiver of the FERC advance notice requirement set forth in 18 CFR 35.11.

All other provisions of FERC Contract No. 26 shall remain in effect. CHG&E states that copies of the subject filing
were served upon NYSEG.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or
protests should be filed on or before February 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available
for public inspection.

Notice of hearing designation order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

Cellular application of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) is designated for hearing. The Commission has determined
that a substantial and material question of fact exists as to whether a subsidiary of TDS has misrepresented facts
to or lacked candor before the Commission. The hearing will examine the subsidiary's conduct before the Commission
and determine whether TDS holds the requite character qualifications necessary to hold the cellular license for
the Wisconsin 8 (Vernon) Rural Service Area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This is a summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order and Hearing Designation Order in CC Docket 94-11, adopted February
1, 1994, and released February 1, 1994. 



The full text of Commission decisions are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the
FCC Dockets Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision may also be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140,
Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. 



Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order and Hearing Designation Order



The Commission has designated for hearing the cellular application of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) for
the Wisconsin 8 (Vernon) Rural Service Area. United States Cellular Corporation (USCC), a TDS subsidiary, was a party
of La Star Cellular Telephone Company (La Star), an applicant to provide cellular service in St. Tammany Parish in
the New Orleans, Louisiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. La Star's application was designated for hearing with
the mutually exclusive application of New Orleans CGSA, Inc. (NOCGSA). La Star was found to be ineligible and the application
of NOCGSA was granted. The Commission affirmed this conclusion. See La Star Cellular Telephone Company, 6 FCC Rcd
6860 (I.D. 1991), 

aff'd, 

7 FCC Rcd 3762 (1992), 

appeal pending sub nom., Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. 

v. 

FCC, 

Case No. 92-1273 (D.C. Cir.). 

NOCGSA argued that USCC misrepresented facts and lacked candor before the Commission. Neither the presiding administrative
law judge, nor the Commission reached the merits of those arguments. The Commission did state, however, that the issues
could be revisited in future proceedings. See La Star Cellular Telephone Company, 7 FCC Rcd at 3767, n.3. 

The Commission has revisited the character arguments in the instant Order and has concluded that a substantial and
material question of fact exists as to whether USCC was fully truthful and candid in its dealings with the Commission.
For instance, one USCC principal swore in written testimony that a management committee controlled the actions of
La Star. Oral testimony elicited from that same witness, however, showed that the management committee served little
purpose and did not direct the actions of La Star. Because the Commission believes that a substantial and material
question of fact exists about USCC's character, it has designated issues for hearing to determine whether USCC principals
misrepresented facts or lacked candor in the 

La Star 

proceeding. The hearing will also determine based upon the evidence of whether USCC misrepresented facts or lacked
candor, whether TDS holds the necessary character qualifications to hold the license for the Wisconsin 8 Rural Service
Area. 

Pursuant to section 309(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended, TDS's application has been designated for
hearing upon the following issues listed below: 

(1) To determine whether United States Cellular Corporation misrepresented facts to the Commission, lacked candor
in its dealings with the Commission, or attempted to mislead the Commission, and, in this regard, whether United States
Cellular Corporation has violated  1.17 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.17.

(2) To determine, based on the evidence adduced in issue 1, above, whether Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. possesses
the requisite character qualifications to hold the cellular Block B authorization for the Wisconsin 8 (Vernon) Rural
Service Area and, accordingly, whether grant of its application would serve the public interest, convenience, and
necessity. 

The Commission has further noted that if USCC has lacked candor or misrepresented facts in any pleadings filed within
a year of the release of the Order, the presiding administrative law judge may find that USCC or TDS has violated  1.17
of the Commission's rules and impose a forfeiture up to the statutory maximum.

<DOCTITLE>Agency Forms Under Review</DOCTITLE>


BACKGROUND:

 Notice is hereby given of the submission of proposed information collection to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for its review and approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (Title 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and under OMB regulations
on Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public (5 CFR part 1320). A copy of the proposed information collection(s)
and supporting documents is available from the agency clearance officer listed in the notice. Any comments on the
proposal should be sent to the agency clearance officer and to the OMB desk officer listed in the notice.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Request for OMB approval to revise the following report: 


1. 

Report title:

 Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks


Agency form number:

 FFIEC 002


OMB Docket number:

 7100-0032


Frequency:

 Quarterly


Reporters:

 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks


Annual reporting hours:

 44,045


Estimated average hours per response:

 19.15


Number of respondents:

 575
Small businesses are affected.


General description of report:


This information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 3105 (b)(2), 1817(a)(1) and (3), and 3102(b)] and is given partial
confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)].
On a quarterly basis, all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (U.S. branches) are required to file detailed
schedules of assets and liabilities in the form of a condition report and a variety of supporting schedules. This balance
sheet information is used to fulfill the supervisory and regulatory requirements of the International Banking Act
of 1978. The data are also used to augment the bank credit, loan, and deposit information needed for monetary policy
purposes. The report is collected and processed by the Federal Reserve on behalf of all three federal bank regulatory
agencies. The proposed changes affect several existing schedules; the proposed changes are as follows:



(1) Revisions to reflect the effect of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (FASB 115), which agencies and branches of foreign banks must
adopt for FFIEC 002 purposes for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993:



(a) A new item would be added to Schedule RAL, ``Assets and Liabilities'', for ``Assets Held in Trading Accounts.''
(b) In the Memorandum section of Schedule RAL, ``Assets and Liabilities'', Memorandum item 1, ``Market value of securities
held'', would be deleted. Four new memoranda items would be added for ``Fair value of held-to-maturity securities'',
``Amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities'', ``Fair value of available-for-sale securities'', and ``Amortized
cost of available-for-sale securities.''
(2) On Schedule RAL, ``Assets and Liabilities'', a memorandum item would be added to indicate the level of auditing
work performed for the U.S. branch.
(3) On Schedule C, ``Loans'', a new item would be added for ``Lease financing receivable (net of unearned income)'',
with a split into separate subitems for U.S. addressees (domestic) and non-U.S. addressees (domestic).
(4) On Schedule M, ``Duefrom/Due to Related Institutions in the U.S. and in Foreign Countries'', the title for Part
IV, ``Allowance for loan losses'' would be retitled as ``Confidential Loan Information'', and a new item would be
added for ``Other Real Estate Owned.''
(5) On Schedule M, Part V, ``Commitments and contingencies with related depository institutions'', two new items
would be added for ``all other off-balance sheet contingent liabilities'' and ``all other off-balance sheet continent
claims.''
In addition, the general instructions to the FFIEC 002 would be modified to allow on-balance sheet amounts associated
with conditional and exchange contracts (e.g., forwards, interest rate swaps, and options) to be offset in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39. This would be an interim treatment pending clarification
of an interpretive issue under Interpretation No. 39. However, consistent with existing instructions to the commercial
bank Call Report, the instructions to the FFIEC 002 would be modified to indicate that the netting of assets and liabilities

Privacy Act of 1974: Altered System of Records



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Office of the Secretary, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of an altered system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposes to amend the system notice for its system of records
09-90-0024, the Financial Transactions of HHS Accounting and Finance Offices, by adding routine use
Number 16. This routine use would enable the Department to disclose necessary information to automated data processing
contractors that have been hired to develop, test, or operate automated data processing systems to be used for processing
the financial and accounting transactions of HHS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The system notice was last published at 53 FR 11707 (1988). The proposed routine use is to enable the agency to disclose
to a contractor so that it can develop, test, or operate automated data processing systems to be used for processing
these financial transactions. This use meets the compatibility of purpose criterion since the financial records
have been collected to process and keep track of individual financial transactions, and the automated data processing
system being serviced by the contractor will be used for that purpose.




The complete system notice is republished below.




Dated: February 7, 1994.

09-90-0024



System name:



Financial Transactions of HHS Accounting and Finance Offices, HHS/OS/ASMB.



Security classification:



None.



System location:



See Appendix 1.

Memoranda copies of claims submitted for reimbursement of travel and other expenditures while on official business
may also be maintained at the administrative office of the HHS employee. Records concerning delinquent debts may
also be maintained at the program office or by designated claims officers apart from the finance office.



Categories of individuals covered by the system:



All persons who receive a payment from OPDIV/Agency/Regional finance offices and all persons owing monies to these
HHS offices. Persons receiving payments include, but are not limited to, travelers on official business, grantees,
contractors, consultants, and recipients of loans and scholarships. Persons owing monies include, but are not limited
to, persons who have been overpaid and who owe HHS a refund and persons who have received from HHS goods or services for
which there is a charge or fee (e.g. Freedom of Information Act requesters).



Categories of records in the system:



Name, identification number, address, purpose of payment, accounting classification and amount paid. Also, in
the event of an overpayment and for delinquent loans, grants or scholarships, the amount of the indebtedness, the
repayment status and the amount to be collected.



Authority for maintenance of the system:



Budget and Accounting Act of 1950 (Pub. L. 81-784). Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).



Purpose(s):



These records are an integral part of the accounting systems at operating division, agency, regional office and specific
area locations. The records are used to keep track of all payments to individuals, exclusive of salaries and wages,
based upon prior entry into the systems of the official commitment and obligation of government funds. When an individual
is to repay funds advanced as a loan or scholarship, etc., the records will be used to establish a receivable record
and to track repayment status. In the event of an overpayment to an individual, the record is used to establish a receivable
record for recovery of the amount claimed. The records are also used internally to develop reports to the Internal
Revenue Service and applicable state and local taxing officials of taxable income. This is a Departmentwide notice
of payment and collection activities at all locations listed in Appendix 1.



Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses:



1. Records will be routinely disclosed to the Treasury Department for check preparation.

2. Records may be disclosed to members of Congress concerning a Federal financial assistance program. Also, disclosure
may be made to a congressional office from an individual's record in response to an inquiry from the congressional
office made at the request of the individual.

3. In the event the Department deems it desirable or necessary, in determining whether particular records are required
to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, disclosure may be made to the Department of Justice for the purpose
of obtaining its device.

4. A record from this system of records may be disclosed as a ``routine use'' to a Federal, State or local agency maintaining
civil, criminal or other relevant enforcement records or other pertinent records, such as current licenses, if necessary
to obtain a record relevant to an agency decision concerning the hiring or retention of an employee, the issuance of
a security clearance, the letting of a contract or the issuance of a license, grant or other benefit.

5. A record from this system of records may be disclosed to a Federal agency, in response to its request, in connection
with the hiring or retention of an employee, the issuance of a security clearance, the reporting of an investigation
of an employee, the letting of a contract or the issuance of a license, grant, or other benefit by the requesting agency,
to the extent that the record is relevant and necessary to the requesting agency's decision on the matter.

6. Where Federal agencies having the power to subpoena other Federal agencies' records, such as the Internal Revenue
Service or the Civil Rights Commission, issue a subpoena to the Department for records in this system of records, the
Department will make such records available.

7. Where a contract between a component of the Department and a labor organization recognized under E.O. 11491 provides
that the agency will disclose personal records relevant to the organization's mission, records in the system of records
may be disclosed to such organization.
8. A record may be disclosed to the Department of Justice, to a court, or other tribunal, or to another party before such
tribunal, when: (1) HHS, or any component thereof; (2) Any HHS employee in his or her official capacity; (3) Any HHS
employee in his or her individual capacity where the Department of Justice (or HHS, where it is authorized to do so)
has agreed to represent the employee; or (4) The United States or any agency thereof where HHS determines that the litigation
is likely to affect HHS or any of its components, is a party to litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and HHS
determines that the use of such records by the Department of Justice, the tribunal, or the other party is relevant and
necessary to the litigation and would help in the effective representation of the governmental party, provided however,
that in each case, HHS determines that such disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected.
9. A record about a loan applicant or potential contractor or grantee may be disclosed to credit reporting agencies
to obtain a credit report in order to determine his/her creditworthiness.
10. When an individual applies for a loan under a loan program as to which the OMB has made a determination under I.R.C.
6103(a)(3), a record about his/her application may be disclosed to the Treasury Department to find out whether he/she
has a delinquent tax account, for the sole purpose of determining his/her creditworthiness.
11. A record from this system may be disclosed to the following entities in order to help collect a debt owed the United
States:
a. To another Federal agency so that agency can effect a salary offset;
b. To another Federal agency so that agency can effect an administrative offset under common law or under 31 U.S.C.
3716 (withholding from money payable to, or held on behalf of, the individual);
c. To the Treasury Department to request his/her mailing address under I.R.C. 6103(m)(2) in order to locate him/her
or in order to have a credit report prepared;
d. To agents of the Department and to other third parties, including credit reporting agencies, to help locate him/her
or to obtain a credit report on him/her, in order to help collect or compromise a debt;
e. To debt collection agents under 31 U.S.C. 3718 or under common law to help collect a debt; and
f. To the Justice Department for litigation or for further administrative action.
Disclosure under part (d) of this use is limited to the individual's name, address, Social Security number, and other
information necessary to identify him/her. Disclosure under parts (a)-(c) and (e) is limited to those items;
the amount, status, and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose. An address obtained
from IRS may be disclosed to a credit reporting agency under part (d) only for purposes of preparing a commercial credit
report on the individual. Part (a) applies to claims or debts arising or payable under the Social Security Act only
if the employee consents in writing to the offset.
12. A record from this system may be disclosed to another Federal agency that has asked the Department to effect an administrative
offset under common law or under 31 U.S.C. 3716 to help collect a debt owed the United States. Disclosure under this
routine use is limited to: Name, address, Social Security number, and other information necessary to identify the
individual, information about the money payable to or held for the individual, and other information concerning
the administrative offset.
13. Disclosure with regard to claims or debts arising under or payable under the Social Security Act may be made from
this system to ``consumer reporting agencies'' as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)) or
the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1986 (31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3)). However, this disclosure will not be made with regard
to debts from overpayments to beneficiaries under Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) and Title
XVI (Supplementary Security Income) of this Act. The purpose of this disclosure is to aid in the collection of outstanding
debts owed the Federal Government. Disclosure of records is limited to the individual's name, address, Social Security
number, and other information necessary to establish the individual's identity; the amount, status, and history
of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose.
14. Information in this system of records is used to prepare W-2 and 1099 Forms to submit to the Internal Revenue
Service and applicable state and local governments items considered to be included as income to an individual: certain
travel related payments to employees, all payments made to persons not treated as employees (e.g. fees to consultants
and experts), and amounts written-off as legally or administratively uncollectible, in whole or in part.
15. A record may be disclosed to banks enrolled in the Treasury Credit Card Network to collect a payment or debt when
the individual has given his/her credit card number for this purpose.
16. Records may be disclosed to a contractor (and/or to its subcontractor) who has been engaged to perform services
on an automated data processing system used in processing financial transactions. The contractor may have been engaged
to develop, modify and test a new automated data processing (ADP) system, including both software and hardware upgrades
or enhancements to such a system; perform periodic or major maintenance on an existing ADP system; audit or otherwise
evaluate the performance of such an ADP system; and/or operate such an ADP system.

Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies:




Disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12): 

Disclosure may be made from this system to ``consumer reporting agencies'' as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting
Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f) or the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3)). The purpose of this disclosure
is to aid in the collection of outstanding debts owed to the Federal Government, typically, to provide an incentive
for debtors to repay delinquent Federal Government debts by making these debts part of their credit records. Disclosure
of records is limited to the individual's name, address, Social Security number, and other information necessary
to establish the individual's identity; the amount, status and history of the claim; and the agency or program under
which the claim arose. The disclosure will be made only after the procedural requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have
been followed.


Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system: Storage:


Hard copy documents are manually filed at agency and regional office sites; and on disc pack and magnetic tape at central
computer sites.


Retrievability:


This varies according to the particular accounting system within the Operating Division, Agency and Regional Office.
Usually the hard copy document is filed by name within accounting classification. Computer records may be indexed
by social security number and voucher number. Intra-departmental uses and transfers concern the validation and
certification for payment, and for HHS internal audits.


Safeguards:


1. 

Authorized users: 

Employees and officials directly responsible for programmatic or fiscal activity, including administrative and
staff personnel, financial management personnel, computer personnel, and managers who have responsibilities
for implementing HHS funded programs.
2. 

Physical safeguards: 

File folders, reports and other forms of personnel data, and electronic diskettes are stored in areas where fire and
life safety codes are strictly enforced. All documents and diskettes are protected during lunch hours and nonworking
hours in locked file cabinets or locked storage areas. Magnetic tapes and computer matching tapes are locked in a computer
room and tape vault.
3. 

Procedural safeguards: 

Password protection of automated records is provided. All authorized users protect information from public view
and from unauthorized personnel entering an office. The safeguards described above were established in accordance
with HHS Chapter 45-13 of the General Administration Manual; and the HHS ADP Systems Manual Part 6, ``ADP Systems
Security.''


Retention and disposal:


Records are purged from automated files once the accounting purpose has been served; printed copy and manual documents
are retained and disposed of in accordance with General Accounting Office principles and standards as authorized
by the National Archives and Records Service.


System manager(s) and address:


See Appendix 2.


Notification procedure:


Inquiries are to be made, either in writing or in person, to the organizations listed under ``Location'' in appendix
1, with the exception of Food and Drug Administration records. For those records, contact: FDA Privacy Act Coordinator
(HFW-30), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
Give name and social security number, purpose of payment or collection (travel, grant, etc.) and, if possible, the
agency accounting classification.


Record access procedure:


Same as notification procedures. Requesters should also clearly specify the record contents being sought, and may
include a request for an accounting of disclosures that have been made of their records, if any. (These access procedures
are in accordance with Department regulations (45 CFR 5b.5(a)(2)).)


Contesting record procedure:


Contact the official at the address specified under notification procedure above, and reasonably identify the record
and specify the information being contested, the corrective action sought, and the reasons for requesting the correction,
along with supporting information to show how the record is inaccurate, incomplete, untimely or irrelevant.


Record source categories:


Travel vouchers submitted by the individual; grant, contract and loan award document; delinquent loan, grant and
scholarship record; consultant invoice of services rendered; and application for travel advance.


Systems exempted from certain provisions of the act:


None.

PURPOSE: 

Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic
investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed
to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility
to CDC.



CDC has begun an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) near
Idaho Falls, Idaho. Sanford Cohen & Associates (SC&A) is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose
reconstruction under contract to CDC. SC&A has formed a working group made up of Idaho citizens. The working group's
primary purpose is to follow the project's progress and provide input in SC&A's planning process.

The working group meetings are intended to promote direct public input into Phase I of the INEL Dose Reconstruction
Project. Topics will focus particularly on technical and operational issues to help improve and expedite the process
of identifying and retrieving documents relevant to a dose reconstruction for INEL.

The public information meetings are to: (1) share information about SC&A's working group, (2) provide the public
an opportunity to review actual records that have been entered into the database; and (3) gain input from the public
on the project.

Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Program Background and Objectives



Grants covered by this announcement will be supported by SPRANS funds set aside under the Maternal and Child Health
Services Block Grant in the category of special MCH improvement projects (MCHIP) which contribute to the health of
CSHCN and their families. The purpose of these grants is to help eliminate overlap and fragmentation of services to
children and their families through creation of new community service systems, working together with health, education
and social service professionals. Applications are solicited for projects which:

(1) Demonstrate the ability of health, social service and education professionals to work together in communities
to foster successful physical, social and emotional growth for children and their families;

(2) Assist in the development of curricula at institutions of higher learning, based on best practices learned in
community settings; and

(3) Disseminate a collaborative model of personnel training and service delivery at the regional, State and national
levels. 

Grantees are expected to work collaboratively with the Commission on Leadership in Interprofessional Education
to field test model curricula. The Commission, an organizational unit of the Association of Teacher Educators which
grew out of a March, 1990, symposium cosponsored by MCHB, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education,
and the American Academy of Pediatrics, focuses on the study of ways to produce a new generation of interprofessionally
oriented leaders in health, teaching, administration, social work, and other human service professions whose members
possess the knowledge, skills and values needed to create new community service systems for children and their families.


Preference for funding will be given to applicants with prior experience linking health, education and social service
professionals together with policy makers in State and local health and education agencies and private sector organizations
to solve complex problems facing children and their families that require collaboration. This means that approved
applicants with such experience will be funded ahead of other categories or groups of applicants. 

Applicants will use guidelines adapted from the FY 1993 SPRANS Field-Initiated Project subcategory to prepare their
applications. These guidelines will be included with the grant application materials. Information in this announcement,
such as application receipt dates, will supersede that contained in the guidelines. 

Time does not permit a formal comment period on the category and preferences described above. Any comments which members
of the public wish to make should be submitted to: Chief, Grants Management Branch, at the address listed in the ADDRESSES


section.

Special Concerns 



In its administration of the MCH Services Block Grant, the MCHB 
places special emphasis on improving service delivery to women and 
children from culturally identifiable populations who have been 
disproportionately affected by barriers to accessible care. This 
means that SPRANS projects are expected to serve and appropriately 
involve in project activities members of ethnoculturally distinct 
groups, unless there are compelling programmatic or other 
justifications for not doing so. The MCHB
s intent is to ensure 
that project outcomes are of benefit to culturally distinct 
populations and to ensure that the broadest possible 
representation of culturally distinct and historically underserved 
groups is supported through programs and projects sponsored by the 
MCHB. 

Projects supported under SPRANS are expected to be part of 
community-wide, comprehensive initiatives, to reflect appropriate 
coordination of primary care and public health activities, and to 
target HRSA resources effectively to fill gaps in the Nation
s 
health system for at-risk mothers and children. This applies 
especially to projects in the 15 communities in the Nation which 
have received grants from HRSA under the Administration
s Healthy 
Start initiative. Grantees in these communities providing 
services related to activities of a Healthy Start program are 
expected to coordinate their projects with the Healthy Start 
program efforts. Healthy Start communities include: Aberdeen 
Area Indian Nations, NE/ND/SD; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL; 
Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Lake County, 
IN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia, PA; 
Pittsburgh, PA; PeeDee Region, SC; and Washington, DC. 



Grants/Amounts:

 Up to $600,000 of SPRANS funds will be available 
to support up to two projects at a maximum of $300,000 per award 
for a one-year period. Awards are made for grant periods of up to 
four years. 



Review Criteria 



The following general criteria are used, as pertinent, to review 
and evaluate for funding all applications for SPRANS grants and 
cooperative agreements:

 


_The quality of the project plan or methodology. 

_The need for the services, research, training or 
technical assistance. 

_The cost-effectiveness of the proposed project relative 
to the number of persons proposed to be benefitted, served or 
trained, considering, where relevant, any special circumstances 
associated with providing care or training in various areas. 

_The extent to which the project will contribute to the 
advancement of MCH and/or CSHCN services. 

_The extent to which rapid and effective use of grant 
funds will be made by the project. 

_The effectiveness of procedures to collect the cost of 
care and service from third-party payment sources (including 
government agencies) which are authorized or under legal 
obligation to make such payment for any service (including 
diagnostic, preventive and treatment services). 

_The extent to which the project will be integrated with 
the administration of the Maternal and Child Health Services block 
grants, State primary care plans, public health, and prevention 
programs, and other related programs in the respective State(s). 

_The soundness of the project's management, considering 
the qualifications of the staff of the proposed project and the 
applicant's facilities and resources. 

_The extent to which the project gives special emphasis to 
improving service delivery to women and children from culturally 
identifiable populations who have been disproportionately affected 
by barriers to accessible care and ensures that members of 
culturally distinct groups are appropriately represented in the 
activities of approved grants and cooperative agreements. 

_In communities with Healthy Start projects, a commitment 
by applicants whose projects are related to activities of a 
Healthy Start program to coordinate their projects with Healthy 
Start program efforts. 

_The strength of the project's plans for evaluation. 

_The strength of the applicant's prior experience linking 
health, education and social service professionals together with 
policy makers in State and local health and education agencies and 
private sector organizations to solve complex problems facing 
children and their families that require collaboration.

 


In addition to the above criteria, other special review criteria 
are used to assess grants announced in this notice. As detailed 
in the guidance enclosed with the application packet, these 
special review criteria focus closely on the quality of each 
element of the program narrative section of the application: the 
problem; contributing factors; project goals; outcome objectives; 
methodology; tracking of project implementation; monitoring and 
evaluations; use of project information; capabilities of the 
applicant; budget and justification; and the overall significance 
of the project.

<DOCTITLE>Pecos National Historical Park; Minor Revision of Park Boundary </DOCTITLE>



Public Law 101-313 established Pecos National Historical Park on June 27, 1990. The March 1990 map, referenced
in the legislation as ``Pecos National Historical Park Boundary Concept'' and numbered 430/80028 identified the
area of the park as being approximately 5,865 acres including the Forked Lightning Ranch. Section 202(b) of Public
Law 101-313 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make minor revisions in the boundary of the park in accordance
with section 7(c) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460

l

-4 and following). 

Since establishment of the park, the National Park Service has determined that the Forked Lightning Ranch actually
included property located outside the established boundary: A 66.29-acre parcel of land encumbered by an easement
for the old U.S. Highway 85, and an unencumbered 29.26 acres located west of the old highway easement. It was the intention
of the parties involved in the expansion of the park to include the entire Forked Lightning Ranch property within the
boundary. In order to facilitate improved resource protection and law enforcement it has been determined necessary
to revise the park boundary to include an additional 100.55 acres. This includes the Old Highway 85 right-of-way (66.29
acres), the 29.26-acre parcel located west of the old highway, and an additional 5.00 acres owned by the State of New
Mexico located adjacent to the old highway. 

Therefore, notice is hereby given that in accordance with the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, as amended, the
boundary of Pecos National Historical Park should be revised as described above. The revised boundary is depicted
on a map entitled ``Boundary Map, Pecos National Historical Park,'' Drawing No. 430/80,043, and dated September
1993. This map is on file and available for inspection in the Office of the National Park Service, Department of the
Interior; the Office of the Southwest Region, National Park Service; and the Office of the Superintendent, Pecos
National Historical Park.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from January 22, 1994, through
February 4, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4933).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By March 18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director):

 petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved. 



Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-373 and 50-374, LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2, LaSalle County,
Illinois




Date of amendment request: 

January 24, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would implement Line Item 5.9 of NRC Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line Item Technical Specification
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' which recommends licensees
consider deleting the requirements to perform response time testing for selected instrumentation in the isolation
system where the required time corresponds to the diesel start time.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


LaSalle has evaluated the proposed Technical Specification Amendment. Based upon the criteria for defining a Significant
Hazards Consideration established in 10 CFR 50.92(c), operation of LaSalle County Station in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:

The proposal seeks to eliminate response time testing requirements for selected instrumentation in the isolation
system. The proposal does not introduce changes in the response times themselves. The probability and consequences
of an accident previously evaluated are not increased because accepted licensing criteria are maintained. The requirements
for channel checks, functional tests, calibrations, and logic system functional tests are not altered by this proposal.
The ability to detect degrading trends of response times is available via the above Technical Specification required
tests. Therefore, the response times of these systems will be maintained within the acceptance limits assumed in
plant safety analyses and required for successful mitigation of an initiating event because of the continued Technical
Specification testing.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:

The proposal does not change component or system interactions. Accident analyses assume a loss of AC power which is
restored by startup of emergency diesel generators. The 13 second interval associated with the restoration of AC
power, which establishes the response time for the isolation functions, is maintained. The starting, sequencing,
and loading functions associated with the diesel generators is not affected by the proposed change. The response
times include the instrument response times, which are typically measured in fractions of a second, and the response
times of the actuation logic circuits, which are typically less than a second. These times are small in comparison
to the diesel generator start time (13 seconds). The ability of the isolation system to perform its intended function
to mitigate the consequences of an initiating event within the acceptance limits assumed in plant safety analyses
is not altered by the proposed change.

3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:

The proposal does not involve the relaxation of any criteria identified in the SAR or reduce any of the requirements
of Technical Specifications. The proposed revision does not affect licensing acceptance limits associated with
accidents. With the exception of MSIVs, the safety analyses do not address individual sensor response times or the
response times of the logic systems to which the sensors are connected. These analyses conservatively establish
the margin of safety. Deleting the requirement to perform unnecessary response time testing does not affect the results
of accident and transient analyses. Plant and system response to an initiating event will remain in compliance within
the assumptions of safety analyses. 
 
The proposed change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident, and there is no impact on equipment
important to safety or systems, structures or components. There is no associated change to the type, amount, or control
of radioactive effluents, nor is there an associated increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation
exposure. There is no effect upon the capabilities of the associated systems to perform their intended functions
within the allowed response times assumed in safety analyses. Therefore, the margin of safety is preserved.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-213, Haddam Neck Plant, Middlesex County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

January 17, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO) proposes to remove Technical Specification 3/4.4.12, ``Failed
Fuel Rods'' and its associated BASES Section 3/4.4.12.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below:



The proposed changes do not involve an SHC consideration because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

A review of the accidents detailed in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, was undertaken to determine
if they were impacted by the proposed change. The review indicated that the previously evaluated accidents were not
impacted by the proposed license amendment.

All fuel design and performance criteria are the same for Cycle 18 as in previous cycles. All criteria will continue
to be met and no new single-failure mechanisms will be created. This change does not involve any alterations to plant
equipment or procedures which would affect any operational modes or accident assumptions. This proposed license
amendment does delete a technical specification that is no longer considered necessary. This deletion is prompted
by the replacement of stainless steel clad fuel with zircaloy clad fuel. The zircaloy clad fuel, if it experiences
damage, will release iodine into the primary system. Any iodine released is covered within the guidelines specified
in the existing Technical Specification 3/4.4.8, ``Specific Activity.'' This specification will ensure that operation
does not continue with radiochemistry values that exceed those assumed in our accident assumptions. The existing
Technical Specification of specific activity along with the zircaloy clad fuel will ensure that a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not present.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than any evaluated previously in the UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report] is not created. Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential
for an unanalyzed accident is not created. No new failure modes are introduced.

The presence of defective fuel rods and the resultant iodine release would only affect potential offsite doses. This
proposed license amendment does not increase the radiochemistry limits, but does revert the technical specifications
back to the standard methodology and limitations that were unable to be used because of the stainless steel clad fuel.
These new limitations will continue to ensure that doses remain within the limits prescribed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact on the protective boundaries. The margin of safety, as defined
in the basis for any technical specification, is not reduced. The proposed changes do not adversely impact any of the
safety systems, nor do they increase the number of challenges to the safety systems.

The limit of 160 defective rods was chosen to be consistent with initial conditions assumed for the radiological design
basis. The elimination of this specification is acceptable since the basis for the initial condition can be supported
by the use of zircaloy clad fuel as opposed to the unique stainless steel clad. If future fuel defects are debris induced,
the dose equivalent iodine will be within expected radiochemistry values and the resulting doses will be bounded.
Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the basis of any technical specification with
the deletion of the defective fuel rod technical specification.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester
County, New York




Date of amendment request: 

December 6, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment request would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to provide a temporary one-time
revision to the Definition Section of the TS. Specifically, a footnote is added in the Definition Section of the TS
which is applicable to TS 1.2.1, ``Cold Shutdown Condition,'' changing T

avq

 less than or equal to 200
 F to less than or equal to 250
 F and TS 1.2.2, ``Hot Shutdown Condition,'' changing T

avq

 greater than 200
 F to greater than 250
 F. The footnote further states that the change is for the one time, fuel out, chemical decontamination program.
This program is currently scheduled for the upcoming 1995 refueling outage of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating
Unit 2.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

Approval of the proposed one time change to the Technical Specification definition of cold shutdown for purposes
of performing the full RCS [reactor coolant system] chemical decontamination without fuel in the reactor would provide
relief from unnecessary technical specification action statements that are based on fuel in the reactor. Credible
accidents with significant consequences are practically eliminated with the removal of the reactor fuel during
the performance of the FSD [full reactor coolant system chemical decontamination]. In addition, specific actions
would be taken in accordance with the requirements of the NRC approved WCAP-12932-A Rev. 2 to ensure that RCS and affected
interfacing systems integrity are preserved. Thus, system capability within established accident scenarios would
not be compromised. The proposed amendment would therefore not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

As noted above, the proposed amendment seeks to eliminate unnecessary Technical Specification action requirements
during the performance of full RCS chemical decontamination. These actions are unnecessary because there will be
no fuel in the reactor and the RCS and other affected systems will be operated under conditions well within their design
capability during the implementation of this process. In addition, the FSD effort will be conducted in accordance
with the requirement(s) of the NRC approved Westinghouse topical report WCAP-12932-A Rev. 2. Accidents involving
failures of the decontamination process system will not exceed the bounding conditions for any previously established
accidents involving failure of a radwaste system. Accordingly, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously analyzed will not be created.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment provides relief from technical specification actions in the performance of the FSD which
become unnecessary when there is no fuel in the reactor. The change will not adversely impact any Technical Specification
required systems, structures or components. The design capability of systems, structures or components impacted
will not be reduced. Consequently, no significant reduction in the margin of safety for any system, structure, or
component is involved. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South
Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

January 18, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments remove the tables of containment penetration conductor overcurrent protective devices
from the Technical Specifications (TS) in accordance with the guidance contained in Generic Letter 91-08, ``Removal
of Component Lists from Technical Specifications.'' The tables would be relocated to Chapter 16 of the Catawba Final
Safety Analysis Report (Selected Licensee Commitments Manual). In addition, the licensee proposes the removal
of an obsolete footnote to TS 4.8.4. The footnote, which made TS 4.8.4.a initially effective following the first refueling
outage of Unit 1, is no longer needed. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 





Criterion 1

The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Relocating the component lists of containment penetration conductor overcurrent protective
devices from the technical specifications to the [Selected Licensee Commitments] SLC Manual (with all attendant
required technical specification changes as described previously and also including removal of the above described
obsolete footnote) has no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. No plant equipment
is affected by the proposed change. No equipment is being added or deleted from the lists; only the source document
for the lists is being changed. Any future changes to the lists (i.e., changes to the plant) will be subject to the provisions
of 10CFR50.59 and also subject to the change control provisions of Chapter 6 of Catawba's Technical Specifications.

Criterion 2

The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. No accident causal mechanisms are affected by the proposed change, as no change to the plant is being proposed.
In addition, no change to the manner in which the plant is operated is being made. Finally, no changes to plant procedures
are being made which would affect any accident causal mechanisms.
 
Criterion 3

The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change has no
impact upon any safety margin. The proposed change is consistent with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 91-08
and the control provisions utilized as a result of relocating the subject component lists are at least as stringent
as those set forth in the generic letter.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location:

Description of amendment request: 

The amendments would change the method of measuring the reactor coolant system flow rate (Technical Specifications
2.0 and 3/4.2) during the 18-month surveillance for McGuire, Units 1 and 2.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


(1) This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.



No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The change in method of flow measurement will not change the probability
of actuation of any Engineered Safeguard Feature or other device. The actual flow rate will not change. The consequences
of previously-analyzed accidents will not change as a result of the new method of flow measurement.



(2) This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.



No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The elbow taps are already in place, and are used to monitor flow for the Reactor Protection System. They
will not initiate any new events.



(3) This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



As described in [the licensee's application], the change in method of RCS flow measurement will provide a more accurate
indication of the flow. The actual flow rate will not be affected. The revised setpoints for low reactor coolant flow
are driven by changes to statistical allowances and do not represent substantive, or less conservative, changes.
There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Entergy Operations Inc., Docket No. 50-382, Waterford Steam Electric
Station, Unit 3, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana




Date of amendment request: 

December 23, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification (TS) for the following four items in accordance
with the guidance in Generic Letter (GL) 93-05 ``Line Item Technical Specifications Improvements To Reduce Surveillance
Requirements For Testing During Power Operation''.
1) GL Item 5.14 Radiation Monitors will change the channel functional test from monthly to quarterly.
2) GL Item 6.1 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Isolation Valves will increase the time from 72 hours to 7 days for remaining
in cold shutdown without leak testing the RCS isolation valves.
3) GL Item 6.6 Pressurizer Heaters will change the verification of capacity from at least once per 92 days to each refueling
outage and will change the demonstration of the emergency power supply from at least once per 18 months to at each refueling
outage.
4) GL Item 9.1 Auxiliary Feedwater Pump and System Testing will change 
the frequency of these pumps from once per 31 days on a staggered basis to quarterly on a staggered bases.
All of the above are compatible with Waterford 3 plant operating experience and are consistent with NUREG-1366, ``Improvement
To Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements,'' December 1992 and the licensing basis for Waterford 3.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change to increase the radiation monitoring instrumentation channel functional test from monthly
to quarterly will have no effect on design basis accidents. The findings in NUREG-1366 determined that this change
will increase the availability of radiation monitors.

The proposed change to increase the 72 hour time for remaining in cold shutdown without leak testing the RCS isolation
valves to 7 days will not affect any design basis accidents. NUREG-1366 findings have determined that extending this
interval does not significantly alter the associated risk. In addition, the current requirement has a potential
for causing problems resulting from a hurried recovery.

The proposed change to the pressurizer heater capacity test interval from quarterly to each refueling interval will
have no affect on any design basis accidents. The TS requires at least 2 groups of pressurizer heaters each having a
nominal capacity of 150 kW. Waterford 3 has 8 groups of pressurizer heaters; two proportional groups of 150 kW each,
and 6 backup groups of 200 kW each. An evaluation of past operating experience has shown the availability of at least
6 groups of pressurizer heaters with a minimum of 150 kW each.

The proposed change to extend the testing interval for the EFW [emergency feedwater] pumps will have no affect on any
design basis accidents. The pumps will continue to be tested quarterly to the same standards applied to safety related
pumps as defined by the ASME [American Society of Mechanical Engineers] Section XI Code. Satisfactory completion
of testing in accordance with the Code is accepted as verification that safety related pumps will be available to perform
their intended function.

The proposed changes identified above are supported by the findings identified in NUREG-1366 and consistent with
the guidance provided in Generic Letter 93-05. These line-item improvements are intended to improve plant safety,
decrease equipment degradation, and remove unnecessary burden on personnel resources by reducing the amount of
testing that the TS require during power operation. Therefore, the proposed changes identified above will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

The changes identified above only affect the frequency of surveillance testing. There are no changes that will alter
operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes identified herein extend testing frequency in an effort to improve plant reliability and safety.
The proposed changes are consistent with the findings in NUREG-1366, guidance in Generic Letter 93-05 and plant operating
experience. As such, the proposed changes will preserve the established margin of safety for the affected specifications.
Therefore, the proposed changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 19, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would relocate the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.3.4, Turbine Overspeed Protection,
to Section 16.3 of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2, Final Safety Analysis Report.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves the relocation of the TS [Technical Specification] requirements for the
turbine overspeed protection system to the VEGP [Vogtle Electric Generating Plant] FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report]. The requirements that will reside in the FSAR will continue to ensure that the probability of turbine missile
generation is maintained below NRC limits as defined in NUREG-1048, Appendix U. Since the turbine overspeed protection
system will remain capable of protecting the turbine from excessive overspeed, the proposed change will have no effect
on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than any previously evaluated.
The proposed change does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment,
and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component. In addition, no new limiting failures
have been identified as a result of the proposed change. The requirements for the turbine overspeed protection system
that will reside in the FSAR will ensure that the system remains capable of protecting the turbine from excessive overspeed.
Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than any previously
evaluated. 

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change would allow
the requirements for the turbine overspeed protection system to be relocated to the FSAR on the basis that the turbine
overspeed protection system does not meet the criteria of the NRC Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications
Improvements for Nuclear Reactors. The requirements that will reside in the FSAR for the turbine overspeed protection
system will ensure that the system remains capable of protecting the turbine from excessive overspeed. Therefore,
the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of

Date of amendment request: 

January 25, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to make a one-time change to the technical specifications to add new Technical Specifications
3/4.10.6 and 3/4.10.7 to the Special Test Exemptions section. The new TS would allow the restart of Unit 2 with expired
calibrations on the core exit thermocouples (CET) and the reactor coolant system (RCS) resistance temperature detectors
(RTD). This amendment will also add a new Technical Specification to allow the ascension to 75 percent rated thermal
power with an expired precision heat balance reactor coolant flow measurement.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


(1)The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident.

The proposed change will allow the restart of [STP] Unit 2 with Core Exit Thermocouples and Reactor Coolant System
Resistance Temperature Detectors technically inoperable due to expired calibrations. The calibrations of these
instruments can only be completed when the Unit reaches Normal Operating Pressure and Normal Operating Temperature
in Mode 3. Once the calibrations of these instruments are completed, this one time change will expire and all of the
existing applicable Limiting Conditions for Operations will become effective immediately. Since industry and
South Texas Project Electric Generating Station experience has shown that the failure mechanism for these types
of instrument is complete failure as opposed to a gradual drift, and there will be calibration points to compare RTD
readings to actual RCS temperature as the RCS temperature increases, it is reasonable to expect these CETs/RTDs will
function as they did before their calibrations expired. For this reason, all applicable functions, including COMS,
T

hot

 , T

cold

, and T

avg

 are expected to operate normally. Because normal operation of the instruments is expected and the only reason for
the instruments being declared inoperable is their expired calibrations, this change does not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed change will also allow the restart of Unit 2 with the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement surveillance
expired. This surveillance is used to confirm the values indicated by the RCS flow meters. These instruments are calibrated
every 18 months and the RCS flow meters will be checked every 12 hours to ensure adequate flow prior to the completion
of the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement. Since this surveillance is only used to confirm the reading of
calibrated instruments and does not involve any changes to the design or function of the instruments, this change
does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The operations of Unit 2 with the CETs and RCS RTDs technically inoperable due to expired calibrations, until these
calibrations can be completed in Mode 3, does not affect the design bases of the CETs and RCS RTDs or any of the accident
evaluations involving these instruments. Since industry and South Texas Project Electric Generating Station experience
indicates that the failure mechanism for these types of instruments is not a gradual drift but complete failure, the
reasonable expectation is the CETs/RTDs will function as they did prior to their calibrations expiring.

Additionally, the operation of Unit 2 with the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement surveillance expired
does not affect the design bases of the RCS flow meters or any of the accident evaluations involving these instruments.
This surveillance is used to confirm the values indicated by the RCS flow meters. These instruments are calibrated
every 18 months and the RCS flow meters will be checked every 12 hours to ensure adequate flow prior to the completion
of the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement. 

Because normal operation of all of these instruments is expected, these changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

(3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The RCS RTDs are auctioneered to prevent a failed high or low instrument from adversely influencing the safety of the
plant. This feature is still operable and will, along with normal operator activities, provide assurance that the
margin of safety is not reduced by this change. In addition, the change does not affect the design bases, accident analysis,
reliability or capability of the CETs/RTDs to perform their intended safety functions. The RCS flow meters will be
checked every 12 hours to ensure adequate flow prior to the completion of the precision heat balance RCS flow measurement.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendment involves no
significant hazards consideration.

Nebraska Public Power District, Docket No. 50-298, Cooper Nuclear Station, 
Nemaha County, Nebraska




Date of amendment request: 

September 28, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications to modify the licensee's
organizational structure by removing the positions of ``Site Manager'' and ``Senior Manager of Operations.'' The
functions presently given in CNS Technical Specifications for the Site Manager position will be assumed by the Vice
President - Nuclear.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?



Evaluation

The proposed change removing the positions of Site Manager and Senior Manager of Operations from the Technical Specifications
is administrative in nature. The functions and responsibilities of the previous position of Site Manager presently
given in the plant Technical Specifications will be performed by the Vice President - Nuclear. Additionally, with
the reorganization, the Senior Manager of Operations position is eliminated and therefore, this position is also
being removed. The provision in the Technical Specifications for automatic shifting of Plant Manager responsibilities
to the Senior Manager of Operations has also been removed. The shifting of Plant Manager responsibilities (in writing)
to one of the Managers at CNS who is qualified for this position remains in the Technical Specifications. The position
removals and responsibility transfers in the organization do not affect plant design or operation, nor do they affect
the way any systems, structures, or components are operated or maintained. The individual filling the position ``Vice
President - Nuclear'' is qualified to perform the assigned tasks and responsibilities. Restructuring of the sentence
in specification 6.2.B.6, is purely an administrative change. Also, this proposed change does not alter the conditions
or assumptions in any of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) accident analyses. Since the USAR accident analyses
remain bounding, the consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed change. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the proposed License Amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?

Evaluation

The proposed Technical Specification revision removes all references to the position title of the Site Manager.
The responsibilities of this position presently given in the Technical Specifications are being incorporated and
performed by the position ``Vice President - Nuclear.'' Additionally, with the reorganization, the Senior Manager
of Operations position is eliminated and therefore, this position is also being removed. The shifting of Plant Manager
responsibilities (in writing) to one of the Managers at CNS who is qualified for this position remains in the Technical
Specifications. All given management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals. Restructuring
of the sentence in specification 6.2.B.6 is purely an administrative change. This change does not affect the design
or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant, and is considered to be an administrative change.
Accordingly, no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety, nor has
any new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, this proposed change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety?

Evaluation

This proposed amendment involves a change to the Administrative Controls Section of the CNS Technical Specifications;
specifically, removal of two positions referenced in the organizational structure. The Site Manager position is
being deleted and the responsibilities of this position listed in the Technical Specifications are being performed
by the Vice President - Nuclear. Additionally, with the reorganization, the Senior Manager of Operations position
is eliminated and therefore, this position and responsibilities are also being removed. The shifting of Plant Manager
responsibilities (in writing) to one of the Managers at CNS who is qualified for this position remains in the Technical
Specifications. All given management activities, as described in the Technical Specifications, will continue
to be performed by qualified individuals. Restructuring of the sentence in specification 6.2.B.6, is purely an administrative
change. The proposed change does not adversely impact the plant's ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements.
The proposed change does not alter any means of plant operation, nor does the proposed change involve any physical
alterations to the plant and does not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. Therefore, this proposed change
does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

December 10, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications Sections 3/4.21
``Environmental/Radiological Effluents,'' and 6.5, ``Station Reporting Requirements,'' to change the frequency
of the reporting period of the ``Semiannual Radioactive Materials Release Report'' from semiannual to annual and
to extend the reporting frequency of the Annual Design Change Report from an annual submittal to annually or along
with the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) updates required by 10 CFR 50.71(e). These proposed changes are intended
to make the CNS Technical Specifications consistent with the current provisions of 10 CFR 50.36(a) and 10 CFR 50.59(b),
respectively.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?



Evaluation

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and makes the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications
(T/S) consistent with amended regulations of 10CFR50.36(a), and 10CFR 50.59(b) by reducing the submittal frequency
of certain reports to the NRC. The proposed revisions do not involve any change to plant design, plant operation, or
configuration of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
Also, the proposed changes do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the Updated Safety Analysis Report
(USAR) accident analyses. Since the USAR accident analyses remain bounding, the radiological consequences previously
evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes. As administrative changes, all defined terms on the
affected pages have been capitalized. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the proposed License Amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?

Evaluation

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and makes the CNS T/S consistent with amended regulations of 10CFR50.36(a),
and 10CFR50.59(b) by reducing the submittal frequency of certain reports to the NRC. The proposed revisions do not
involve any change to plant design, plant operation, or configuration of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate
the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Accordingly, no new failure modes have been created for any
plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed
changes. Also, there will be no change in the types or increase in the amount of effluents released offsite. As administrative
changes, all defined terms on the affected pages have been capitalized. Therefore, the proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
3. Does the proposed change create a significant reduction in the margin of safety?

Evaluation

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not adversely impact the plant's ability to meet applicable
regulatory requirements related to liquid or gaseous effluents, and solid waste releases. The proposed changes
do not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluents, nor do the proposed changes involve any physical
alterations to the plant with respect to radioactive effluents. These changes do not affect the meaning, application,
and function of the T/S requirements. The proposed change will reduce the administrative burden of NRC reporting
without reducing the protection for public health and safety. As administrative changes, all defined terms on the
affected pages have been capitalized. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New
York 




Date of amendment request: 

January 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.2.7, 3.6.2a, 4.6.2a, 3.6.2b and 4.6.2b
to delete the main steam line isolation and automatic reactor shutdown (reactor scram) functions of the Main Steam
Line Radiation Monitor. Conforming changes would also be made to the Bases of these TSs and to the Bases for TS 2.1.2.
The licensee stated that the proposed changes would be consistent with the NRC's Improved Standard Technical Specifications,
NUREG-1433, and with NRC-approved (Safety Evaluation, dated May 15, 1991) Boiling Water Reactor Owners' Group Licensing
Topical Report NEDO-31400A, dated July 9, 1987. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.



The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the functions being removed do not contribute to avoidance of any previously evaluated accidents.
Further, the changes have been shown to have an insignificant impact on overall reactivity control failure frequency.
This insignificant impact is offset by the relatively large reduction in core damage frequency realized by the implementation
of these changes. Hence, the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not significantly
increased due to this change. To the contrary, as stated in the topical report [NEDO-31400A] the changes provide a
net improvement in overall plant safety.
 
The proposed amendment does not involve a physical or procedural change to any structure, component or system that
significantly affects the probability or consequences of any accident or malfunction of equipment important to
safety previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report (Updated). The proposed amendment will involve
a change to reactor protection and isolation actuation systems circuitry that will remove the automatic reactor
shutdown and Main Steam Line Isolation Valve closure functions of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor. However,
the physical changes will not affect the remaining scram or vessel isolation functions.

[***T]he methods, procedures and assumptions used to perform the eneric analyses in NED0-31400A are bounding for
the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 with regard to input values. Niagara Mohawk has also provided in the evaluation reasonable
assurance that significantly increased levels of radioactivity in the main steam lines will be controlled expeditiously
to limit both occupational and environmental exposures. The Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor alarm setpoints will
be set at 1.5 times the normal full power background dose rate and should any monitor exceed its alarm setpoint, the
reactor coolant will be sampled to determine activity levels and the possible need for additional corrective actions.

The offgas radiation monitor is a more sensitive monitor than the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor because the nitrogen-16
source, dominating the radiation signal to the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor, has decayed by the time the radiation
monitor can be affected by any increased levels of activity. Therefore, setting the offgas radiation monitor at 1.5
times the nitrogen-16 background dose rate is not reasonable since setting the monitor that low can lead to spurious
activations of the alarm.

Nine Mile Point Unit 1's monitor configuration, as described in the FSAR, detects the concentration of the offgas
as it flows through the pipe. Thus, the detector is sensitive to fluctuations in condenser air inleakage, which can
have an appreciable impact on the monitor readings, especially at readings as low as 1.5 times the normal full power
background. Therefore, Niagara Mohawk proposes to set the alarm at five (5) times the normal full power background,
which is still very conservative compared to the value allowed by Technical Specification 3.6.15.c., which is set
based on Nine Mile Point 
Unit 1's Offsite Dose Calculation Manual.

Niagara Mohawk believes that a setting of five (5) times the normal full power background is extremely conservative
and is low enough to ensure detection of even minor fuel performance changes. Furthermore, if the monitor alarms at
this setpoint of five times the normal full power background, the offgas will immediately be sampled and analyzed,
followed by an analysis of a reactor coolant sample.

Furthermore, the analyses in the Licensing Topical Report demonstrate that removal of the automatic reactor scram
and Main Steam Line Isolation Valve closure functions of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor does not change the
conclusions in the Final Safety Analysis Report (Updated) that the calculated radiological release consequences
of the bounding control rod drop accident will not exceed the acceptable dose limits specified in 10CFR[Part]100.
 
Therefore, Niagara Mohawk concludes that the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.



The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The function of a Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor trip is to detect abnormal fission produce release and isolate
the main steam lines, thereby stopping the transport of fission products from the reactor to the main condenser. The
monitors do not perform a prevention function for any kind of accident.

The main steam line high radiation scram and main steam line isolation functions were originally intended to mitigate,
not prevent, an existing accident scenario. However, the functions being removed do not contribute to avoidance
or mitigation of any previously evaluated accidents since no credit is taken for these functions in any design basis
event for terminating the initiating event or assuring the radioactive release remains within accepted limits.
The existence of a Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor trip does not prevent the occurrence of a fuel failure event or
any other type of event. Elimination of these functions will not introduce a new or different accident scenario.

The proposed amendment represents a change to the physical configuration of the plant in that some reactor protection
system circuits will be modified to eliminate the main steam line high radiation scram and main steam line isolation
signals. However, these changes will not affect the remaining scram or vessel isolation functions. In all other respects,
plant design and operation remain unchanged.

Therefore, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation concludes that the proposed amendment will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because, as shown in the topical report,
the changes represent an overall improvement in plant safety in that the core damage frequency is reduced. Safe operation
of the plant is enhanced by elimination of the unnecessary scram and isolation of the reactor vessel. With implementation
of these changes, the primary heat sink remains available, a large transient on the vessel and safety-related actuations
is avoided, and the Offgas System remains available to control the pathway of a potential release. 
Therefore, Niagara Mohawk concludes that the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Power Station, Unit 1, New London County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

January 14, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment corrects an editorial error. Specifically, the amendment changes the reference in Limiting
Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.D from ``3.3.A through C'' to ``3.4.A, 3.4.B, and 3.4.C.'' The amendment also changes
the associated bases to clarify the LCO minimum solution concentration requirement of 11 weight percent and updates
the excerpt from 10 CFR 50.62 to reflect the current text of the regulation.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92, NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] has reviewed the proposed change and has
concluded that it does not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that
the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change
would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change only modifies an incorrect reference in Section 3.4.D of the Technical Specifications. In practice,
if Specification 3.4.A, 3.4.B, or 3.4.C cannot be met, an orderly shutdown is initiated. As currently written, the
failure to meet the requirements of Section 3.3 would also initiate a shutdown in accordance with Section 3.4.D. This
is not the intent of Section 3.4.D since Section 3.3 already has specific shutdown requirements. This proposed change
will correct Section 3.4.D so that it limits the conditions under which a plant shutdown must be initiated to the LCOs
of the standby liquid control system. Therefore, this proposed change will not increase the probability or consequences
of an accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed change corrects an incorrect section reference. There is no change to the operation or design of the plant,
nor is there any change to the operability requirements of either section. The proposed change properly identifies
the conditions under which the plant must be shutdown if an LCO is not met for the standby liquid control system. In practice,
if Specification 3.4.A, 3.4.B, or 3.4.C cannot be met, an orderly shutdown is initiated. Since there is no change in
plant operation or design, there is no possibility of a different kind of accident. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change does not modify the design or function of the plant, nor does it reduce operability requirements
of either Section 3.3 or 3.4. The proposed change only corrects an incorrect section reference by identifying the
correct shutdown requirements for the standby liquid control system. Since there is no change to plant operation
or design and the shutdown requirements are not reduced, there is no reduction in the margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Units 1, 2 and 3, New London County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

December 22, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would change the Technical Specification (TS) as follows:
1. Change the title of the Nuclear Station Director to Senior Vice President - Millstone Station.
2. Remove the requirement to provide a copy of Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC) and Site Operations Review
Committee (SORC) meeting minutes to the Executive Vice President - Nuclear. The Senior Vice President - Millstone
Station is being proposed to replace the Executive Vice President - Nuclear for receipt of PORC and SORC meeting minutes.
3. Make editorial changes to the Millstone Unit No. 1 TS Index.
4. Correct a typographical error in Section 6.2.1.d of the Millstone Unit No. 1 TS.
5. Correct a typographical error in Section 6.5.3.1.a of the Millstone Unit No. 3 TS.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is provided below:


The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes do not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

No design basis accidents are affected by these proposed changes. The proposed changes are administrative and editorial
in nature to reflect a recent reorganization, removal of the Executive Vice President - Nuclear from receipt of PORC
and SORC meeting minutes, addition of the Senior Vice President - Millstone Station to the receipt of PORC and SORC
meeting minutes, and editorial changes to the Millstone Unit Nos. 1 and 3 Technical Specifications. No safety systems
are adversely affected by the proposed changes, and no failure modes are associated with the changes. Therefore,
there is no impact on the probability of occurrence or the consequences of any design basis events.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created.
There is no impact on plant response, and no new failure modes are introduced. These proposed administrative and editorial
changes have no impact on safety limits or design basis accidents, and they have no potential to create a new or unanalyzed
event.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The changes do not directly affect any protective boundaries nor do they impact the safety limits for the protective
boundaries. These proposed changes are administrative and editorial in nature. Therefore, there can be no reduction
in the margin of safety.


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

December 17, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to allow a relaxation in setpoint tolerance of
the pressurizer safety valves (PSVs) and main steam safety valves (MSSVs) from plus or minus 1% to plus or minus 3% for
the ``as-found'' test condition. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below:



The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
 
The proposed changes revise the ``as found'' setpoint tolerances for the PSVs and MSSVs from [plus or minus] 1% to [plus
or minus] 3%. For the resetting of the PSVs and MSSVs, a [plus or minus] 1% setpoint tolerance will be required prior
to declaring the valve operable for those instances where the [plus or minus] 1% tolerance was exceeded. The proposed
changes involve no hardware modifications to plant structures, systems, or components. The proposed setpoint tolerance
of [plus or minus] 3% for the ``as-found'' condition was previously evaluated as part of the PSE [Plant Safety Evaluation]
report for the transition to VANTAGE 5H fuel. The PSE was reviewed and approved by the NRC staff as a part of a prior license
amendment.

(9)

 In addition, since the proposed changes have previously been evaluated by the PSE report, the calculated radiological
release associated with the PSE remain unaffected. In addition, the proposed changes are in compliance with applicable
sections of the ASME Code and will not significantly affect structural integrity of either the reactor coolant system
or the main steam system. Therefore, the proposed changes will have no effect on the probability or consequences of
previously evaluated accidents.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously analyzed.
The changes revise the Technical Specifications so that setpoint tolerance for the PSVs and MSSVs can be [plus or minus]
3% for the ``as-found'' condition. These changes have no effect on plant operation. The PSV and MSSV setpoint drift
in excess of the [plus or minus] 1% lift setting is an occurrence which has previously and may subsequently occur. The
analyses for the transition to the VANTAGE 5H fuel have examined the effects on the plant accident analyses for relaxation
in PSV and MSSV setpoint tolerance to [plus or minus] 3%. Also, these changes will have no effect on ASME Code compliance.
These changes do not introduce any new failures.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

In support of the transition to the VANTAGE 5H fuel, a PSE was performed which assumed a [plus or minus] 3% setpoint tolerance
for both the PSVs and MSSVs. Therefore, the effects of relaxing the PSV and MSSV setpoints are already accounted for
in the existing analyses of record and will not affect the plants accident analyses. Additionally, the proposed changes
will have no significant effect on the structural integrity of the reactor coolant system or the main steam system.
Also, for those occurrences where the ``as-found'' setpoint of the PSV or MSSV is in excess of [plus or minus] 1%, a resetting
to within [plus or minus] 1% of the valve setpoint will be required prior to declaring the valve operable. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-275 and 50-323, Diablo
Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, San Luis Obispo County, 
California




Date of amendment requests: 

December 14, 1993 (Reference LAR 93-07)
 T3Description of amendment requests: The proposed amendment would revise the combined Technical Specifications
(TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.8.1, ``A.C.
Sources'' to increase the required quantity of emergency diesel generator (EDG) fuel oil stored in the engine-mounted
tank (day tank). The amendment request also proposes to revise TS 3/4.7.11, ``Area Temperature Monitoring,'' and
3/4.8.1 to remove references to a five EDG configuration. The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:

(1) TS 3/4.7.11 would be revised to remove references to a common (swing) diesel generator in Table 3.7-5.

(2) TS 3.8.1.1 and TS 3.8.1.2 would be revised to increase the required minimum contained volume in the EDG engine-mounted
fuel tank (day tank) from 200 gallons to 250 gallons.

(3) TS 3.8.1.1 and TS 4.8.1.1.2 would be revised to remove references to a five EDG configuration.

(4) TS 3.8.1.2 would be revised to correct a footnote. TS Bases 3/4.8.1, 3/4.8.2, and 3/4.8.3 would be revised to clarify
commitments to Regulatory Guide 1.137 and expand the scope of information contained within the TS Bases. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed increase in day tank TS minimum contained volume requirements provides additional conservatism to
assure the EDG fuel oil contained in the day tank is sufficient to provide adequate time for an operator to take corrective
action to restore the fuel oil supply to the affected day tank in the unlikely event that the fuel oil supply from the
main tanks were cut off.

Deletion of TS references to a five diesel generator configuration and correction of the TS 3.8.1.2 footnote are administrative
changes that do not change the operating methodology of DCPP. These proposed administrative changes remove outdated
information and correct an administrative oversight. 

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
 
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed increase in day tank TS minimum contained volume requirements would not involve any physical change
to the plant systems or, in particular, to the EDG day tanks. The change does not affect the ability of the EDGs to start
and to fulfill their safety-related function. Hence, no new failure mechanisms will be introduced.

The proposed removal of references to a five EDG configuration and correction of the TS 3.8.1.2 footnote are administrative
in nature. Further, the proposed changes would not result in any physical alteration to any plant system. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

Increasing the day tank TS minimum contained volume requirements is a conservative change which provides additional
margin to assure the EDG fuel oil contained in the day tank is sufficient to provide adequate time for an operator to
take corrective action to restore the fuel oil supply to the affected day tank in the unlikely event that the fuel oil
supply from the main tanks were cut off. The proposed change will not alter any accident analysis assumptions, initial
conditions, or results. Consequently, the proposed change to increase the EDG day tank TS contained fuel oil requirement
does not have any effect on the margin of safety.

The proposed administrative changes clarify the TS by removing references to a five diesel generator configuration
and correcting the TS 3.8.1.2 footnote.

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-352 and 50-353, Limerick 
Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania




Date of amendment request: 

December 9, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would change the Operating Licenses and their corresponding Appendices A to reflect the planned implementation
of the Power Rerate Program at Limerick Generating Station Units 1 and 2, and the corresponding increase in the authorized
maximum reactor core power level by five percent to 3458 megawatts thermal (MWt) from the current limit of 3293 MWt.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1) The proposed Operation License (OL) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed power rerate imposes only minor increases in the plant operating conditions. Plant systems, components,
and structures have been verified to be capable of performing their intended functions under rerated conditions.
Where necessary, some components will be modified or replaced prior to implementation of the Power Rerate Program
to accommodate the revised operating condition. No new component or system interactions that could lead to an accident
are created. As discussed below, no transient events result in a new sequence of events which could lead to a new accident
scenario. Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) - Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) Analysis.

The current ECCS-LOCA performance analysis is already bounding for power rerate conditions. The fuel peak cladding
temperature for rerate conditions is 1,345
 F, which is below the 2,200
 F regulatory limit. Therefore, the analysis demonstrates that the LGS, Units 1 and 2 will continue to comply
with 10CFR50.46 and 10CFR50, Appendix K.

Transient Event Analysis

The evaluation results for transient events indicate the margin to the fuel Safety Limit Minimum Critical Power ratio
(MCPR) will be maintained for the 8x8 array fuel types, such as GE8x8NB or GE11 fuel design. The current fuel thermal-mechanical
limits will continue to be met.

Also, the power-dependent and flow-dependent MCPR and Maximum Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR)
limits developed as part of the Average Power Range Monitor Rod Block Monitor Technical Specifications (ARTS) improvement
program are applicable to power rerate. A TS Change Request to implement the ARTS improvement program was submitted
to the NRC by letter dated August 27, 1993. The peak reactor vessel bottom head pressure will remain within the American
Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code requirement for reactor overpressure protection.

The analysis performed focused on the most limiting transient events in each disturbance category selected specifically
for the power rerate evaluations. The results demonstrated that LGS, Unit 1 and Unit 2 core thermal power output can
be safely increased to power rerate parameters without impacting plant safety during a postulated transient event.
The details of the impact to the description in the UFSAR are delineated below. 
 
a) Events Resulting in a Core Coolant Temperature Decrease

i) Loss of Feedwater Heating (LFWH)

The delta Critical Power Ratio (delta CPR) for the LFWH event at the rerated power is bounded by the result estimated
for the current rated power level and remains significantly less than the Operating Limit MCPR. There is no change
between the delta CPR results for high and low reactor core flow conditions. The calculated thermal and mechanical
overpowers for this event at power rerate conditions also meet the fuel design criteria. 

ii) Feedwater Controller Failure (FWCF) Maximum Demand

For the Increased Core Flow (ICF) and the Maximum Extended Load Line Limit (MELLL) conditions, the trend for the FWCF
- Maximum Demand event at rerate conditions is consistent with the current rated power analysis. For both high and
low reactor core flow conditions, the FWCF - Maximum Demand event becomes most limiting due to the Turbine Bypass Valve
Out-of-Service (TBVOOS) and the Recirculation Pump Trip Out-of-Service (RPTOOS) analyses assumption. The fuel
thermal margin results remain within the acceptable limits for the fuel type analyzed. 

b) Events Resulting in a Reactor Pressure Increase

i) Turbine Trip with No Bypass (TTNBP)

At rerate conditions, the fuel transient thermal and mechanical overpower results remain below the NRC acceptance
criteria. 

ii) Generator Load Rejection with No Bypass (LRNBP)

The fuel transient thermal responses are less severe than for the TTNBP event described above. Therefore, at power
rerate conditions, the LRNBP event remains bounded by the TTNBP event. 

iii) Main Steam Isolation Valve Closure, Flux Scram (MSIVF)

The peak reactor vessel bottom head pressure for rerate conditions is slightly higher than the pressure at current
rated conditions due to the higher initial reactor coolant system pressure. However, this result is still below the
ASME overpressure limit of 1,375 psig by a margin of 33 psi.

c) Events Resulting in a Core Coolant System Flow Rate Decrease 

i) Recirculation Pump Seizure

The recirculation pump seizure assumes instantaneous stoppage of the pump motor shaft of one recirculation pump.
As a result, the reactor core flow decreases rapidly. The reactor flow decreases rapidly. The reactor vessel level
swell due to the rapid reactor core flow reduction reaches the high reactor water level setpoint, causing a feedwater
pump trip, a main turbine trip, and subsequently a reactor scram on turbine stop valves closure. The peak neutron flux
and average fuel surface heat flux do not increase significantly above the initial conditions, therefore no impact
on the fuel thermal margin is postulated to occur.

d) Events Resulting in Reactivity and Power Distribution Anomalies

i) Rod Withdrawal Error (RWE)
 
The calculated delta CPR of 0.10 for this event at rerate conditions is bounded by the generic ARTS - based RWE limits
of 0.13. Therefore, the generic ARTS-based RWE analysis delta CPR result is verified to be applicable for power rerate
conditions for LGS Units 1 and 2.

e) Events Resulting in a Reactor Coolant Inventory Increase

i) Inadvertent High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System Actuation

Based on the peak average fuel surface heat flux results, the HPCI actuation event will be bounded by the limiting pressurization
event (i.e., the TTNBP event described above) for delta CPR consideration.

Anticipated Transients Without SCRAM (ATWS) Analysis

A generic evaluation for the ATWS event is provided in Section 3.7 of the Topical Report NEDC-31984P, ``Generic Evaluations
of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate,'' Supplement 1, dated July 1991. This evaluation concludes
that the ATWS acceptance criteria for fuel, reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and containment integrity will be met,
if the following exists;

- Reactor power increases less than or equal to 5%
- Reactor Steam Dome pressure increases less than or equal to 40 psi;
- Safety Relief Valve (SRV) opening setpoints increase less than or equal to 80 psi; and
- ATWS high pressure setpoint increases less than or equal to 20 psi. 

The plant's parameter changes will remain within the above criteria, except that the ATWS high pressure setpoint
increase is 40 psi rather than 20 psi in order to maintain the same relationship between the ATWS high pressure setpoint
and the SRV opening setpoints. Based on the previous analysis, this difference would have a minor effect on the analysis
results. The only significant change is a slightly higher (i.e., about 10 psi) peak RPV pressure.

For additional assurance, a LGS specific ATWS analysis for a 5% power rerate was performed. The events analyzed were:

1. Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) Closure,
2. Pressure Regulator Failure - Open,
3. Loss of Feedwater, and
4. Inadvertent Opening of a Relief Valve.

The LGS specific analysis also concludes that the ATWS acceptance criteria for fuel, RPV, and containment integrity
will be met for a 5% power rerate.
 
Other Evaluations

The impact of power rerate on the radiological consequences of the accidents presented in UFSAR Chapter 15 was determined
based on the current design basis analyses, post rerate implementation system conditions, and radiological source
terms. In general, power rerate will result in a small increase in the quantity of radioactive material released during
accidents and therefore slightly higher (i.e., approximately 2% to 5%) accident doses. However, USFAR Chapter 15
accident doses for rerated conditions remain within the regulatory limits specified in 10CFR100 and 10CFR50, Appendix
A, GDC 19.

The UFSAR Chapter 15 accidents that were evaluated and updated for rerate conditions are as follows:

1) Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)
2) Main Steam Line Break (MSLB)
3) Fuel Handling Accident
4) Control Rod Drop Accident
5) Instrument Line Break
6) Feedwater Line Break
7) Steam Jet Air Ejector Line Break
8) Offgas System Failure
9) Liquid Radioactive Waste System Failure

An evaluation was also performed to address the power rerate impact on accident mitigative features, structures,
systems, and components, within the balance of plant. The results are as follows:

- Auxiliary systems such as the Emergency Service Water, Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Service Water, Ultimate Heat
Sink (i.e., the spray pond), safety-related portions of secondary containment reactor enclosure air cooling, primary
containment drywell air recirculation, and Emergency Diesel Generator enclosure ventilation were confirmed to
operate acceptably under normal and accident conditions after implementation of power rerate.

- Combustible gas control systems were confirmed to be capable of maintaining oxygen concentrations inside the primary
containment within regulatory limits under post accident rerate conditions.

- The secondary containment reactor enclosure recirculation system and Standby Gas Treatment system were confirmed
to be able to adequately contain, process, and control the release of normal and post-accident levels of radioactive
material after implementation of power rerate.

- Instrumentation was reviewed and confirmed to be capable of performing their control and monitoring functions
under rerate conditions.

- Electric power systems including the main turbine generator and switchgear components were verified as being capable
of providing the electrical load as a result of the rerated power levels. No safety-related electrical loads were
affected which would impact the Emergency Diesel Generators.
 
- Piping systems were evaluated for the effect of operation at higher power levels, including transient loadings.
The evaluation confirmed that with few exceptions piping and supports are adequate to accommodate the increased
loadings resulting from operation at rerated power conditions. In a few cases, piping supports will be modified to
accept the higher forces due to rerate conditions.

- The effect of rerate conditions on high energy line break (HELB) events for all Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS)
and Balance of Plant (BOP) systems was evaluated. The evaluation confirmed structures, systems, and components
important to safety are capable of accommodating the effects of jet impingement and blowdown forces and the environmental
effects resulting from HELB events at rerate conditions.

- The Moderate Energy Line Break (MELB) analysis was evaluated for impact due to rerate conditions. Sufficient margin
was determined to exist in the original analysis to bound the rerate conditions.

- Main control room (MCR) habitability was evaluated. Post-accident MCR and Technical Support Center (TSC) doses
were confirmed to be within the limits of General Design Criterion (GDC) 19 of 10CFR50 Appendix A.

- Radiation doses for normal operation were reviewed and confirmed to remain within the limits of 10CFR20 and 10CFR50,
Appendix I. The impact on post-accident sampling activities and post-accident access to vital areas was also confirmed
to be acceptable.

- The environmental qualification of electrical and mechanical equipment important to safety was evaluated for
the impact of normal and accident operating conditions at rerated power levels. The majority of equipment will remain
qualified for the new conditions. For equipment that is not qualified, corrective actions will be taken to ensure
the plant equipment will perform their intended functions under rerate conditions. No new equipment will be added
for power rerate which would increase the potential for component failure. The Preventative Maintenance Program
(PMP) will continue to provide for appropriate equipment repair or replacement during operation at rerated power
conditions.

- The impact of operation at rerated power levels was evaluated for Station Blackout and Fire Safety Shutdown area
heat-up concerns. The evaluation confirmed there is no adverse impact from rerate on the ability of the plant to achieve
safe shutdown under these conditions. 

- The consequences of postulated transients and special events (i.e., ATWS and Station Blackout) will remain within
NRC acceptance criteria for rerate conditions. Concurrent malfunctions assumed to occur during accidents have
been accounted for in the safety analyses for rerate conditions. The consequences of these equipment malfunctions
will not change with implementation of the Power Rerate Program. Equipment that is important to safety either is capable
of or will be modified and/or replaced to be capable of performing its intended function. The availability of redundant
systems to provide safety functions in the event of component malfunction is not impacted as a result of rerate conditions.
Furthermore, the impact of power rerate on the consequences of abnormal transients and accident conditions which
are a result of component malfunctions has been shown to be acceptable.

The probability (i.e., frequency of occurrence) of Design Basis Accidents (DBAs) occurring is not affected by the
proposed increased power level, as the applicable regulatory criteria established for plant equipment (e.g., ASME
Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards, National Electrical Manufacturer's
Association (NEMA) standards, NRC Regulatory Guides) will still be followed as the plant is operated at the rerated
power level. Reactor SCRAM setpoints will be established such that there is no significant increase in frequency
due to rerate conditions. No new challenges to safety-related equipment will result from the implementation of power
rerate.

The changes in consequences of hypothetical accidents which would occur from 102% of the rerated power, compared
to those previously evaluated, are in all cases not significant, because the accident evaluations from a power rerate
to 105% of original rated power will not result in exceeding the applicable NRC approved acceptance limits. The spectrum
of hypothetical accidents and transients has been investigated, and has been determined to meet the current regulatory
criteria for LGS, Units 1 and 2 at rerate conditions. The offsite radiological doses resulting from DBAs are calculated
to increase by only a few percent (i.e., approximately 2% to 5%) because of the rerated power level, and will remain
below 10CFR100 limits. In the area of reactor core design, the fuel operating limits will continue to be met at the rerated
power level, and fuel reload analyses will continue to show that plant transients will meet the criteria accepted
by the NRC as specified in NEDO-24011, ``GESTAR II.''

Challenges to fuel or ECCS performance were evaluated and shown to still meet the criteria of 10CFR50.46 and 10CFR50,
Appendix K. Challenges to the primary containment have been evaluated and still meet 10CFR50, Appendix A, GDC 38,
``Long Term Cooling,'' and GDC 50, ``Containment.'' Radiological release events have been evaluated and have been
shown to meet the guidelines of 10CFR100.

Therefore, the proposed OL changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.

2) The proposed OL changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

All actions to ensure that safety-related structures, systems, and components will remain within their design allowable
values, and ensure that they can perform their intended functions under rerate conditions will be taken prior to implementation
of power rerate. Power rerate does not increase challenges to or create any new challenges to safety-related equipment
or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident. No new equipment is added as a result of implementing the
Power Rerate Program which would create the possibility of a new type of accident. In addition, power rerate does not
create any new sequence of events or failure modes that lead to a new type of accident. 
 
Implementation of power rerate will increase the average neutron flux in the reactor core, which increases the integrated
neutron fluence on the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) wall. To account for the higher fluence, an RPV fracture toughness
analysis was performed for power rerate conditions. This analysis resulted in a proposed revision to the ``pressure
vs. temperature'' curves currently provided in the Technical Specifications (TS), that will maintain the current
level of protection for the RPV. Therefore, power rerate will not result in any new failure mode for the RPV, and thus,
does not create the possibility of a different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
No new operating mode, safety-related equipment lineup, accident scenario, or equipment failure mode was identified
as resulting from the implementation of the Power Rerate Program. The full spectrum of accident considerations defined
in NRC Regulatory Guide 1.70, ``Standard Format and Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants -
LWR Edition,'' Revision 3, dated November 1978, have been evaluated for rerate conditions and no new or different
kind of accident has been identified. Implementation of the Power Rerate Program uses already-developed technology
and applies it within the capabilities of already existing plant equipment in accordance with presently existing
regulatory criteria to include applicable NRC approved codes, standards, and methods. General Electric (GE) has
designed Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) of higher power levels than the rerated power of any of the currently operating
BWR fleet and no new power dependent accidents have been identified.

Therefore, the proposed OL changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3) The proposed OL changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Power rerate will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety, as plant equipment and reactions to transients
and hypothetical accidents will not result in exceeding the presently approved NRC acceptance limits. The accident
doses are calculated to increase a few percent (approximately 2% to 5%) because of power rerate, but remain below 10
CFR 100 limits. The events (i.e., transients, accidents, and ATWS) that form the bases of the TS were evaluated for
power rerate conditions. Although some changes to the TS are required to implement power rerate, no NRC acceptance
limit will be exceeded. Therefore, the margins of safety with respect to the safety limits and other TS bases will be
maintained. 

For systems addressed in the TS Section 2.2, 3/4.1, 3/4.2, 3/4.3, 3/4.4, 3/4.5, 3/4.6 and 3/4.7 (i.e., Reactor Protection
System, Standby Liquid Control System, Power Distribution Limits, Instrumentation, Reactor Coolant System, Emergency
Core Cooling Systems, Containment Systems, and Plant Systems), all components will be operable and capable of performing
their intended functions under power rerate conditions such that the margin of safety is not adversely impacted.

Therefore, the proposed OL changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes revise Table 3.2.F, ``Surveillance Instrumentation,'' to accurately
describe the main stack high range and reactor building roof vent high range radiation monitors, and deletes previously
approved TS Change Request (TSCR) 91-10 for Unit 3 (License Amendment No. 168). TSCR 91-10 requested an emergency
temporary change to the TS to allow fuel loading to take place without all control rods fully inserted into the core.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

Because the proposed changes are administrative in nature, they do not affect the initial conditions or precursors
assumed in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Section 14. These changes do not decrease the effectiveness of
equipment relied upon to mitigate the previously evaluated accidents. 

Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not make any physical changes to the plant or changes to operating procedures. Therefore,
implementation of the proposed changes will not affect the design function or configuration of any component or introduce
any new operating scenarios or failure modes or accident initiation.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and are intended to provide clarification or eliminate confusion
when interpreting the Technical Specifications. The proposed changes do not adversely affect the assumptions or
sequence of events used in any accident analysis.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in any margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Authority, Docket No. 50-395, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Fairfield County, South Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

October 29, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The licensee is preparing to replace the currently installed steam generators with new model Delta 75 steam generators
(Delta 75 SGs). The new steam generators will be larger than those currently installed. The physical changes to the
plant and the accident reanalyses needed to support those changes will necessitate changes to the Technical Specifications
(TS). The TS changes requested involve alterations to the core operating limits, changes to various reactor trip
setpoints, deletion of the negative flux rate trip, removal of references to specific analyses, changes to the steam/feedwater
flow mismatch activation setpoint, changes to shutdown limits, changes to instrument uncertainty allowances,
a change to the methodology for reactor coolant system (RCS) flow determination, modifications to departure from
nucleate boiling (DNB) parameters, a change to the engineered safety features actuation system setpoints for steam
generator water levels, removal of the F* and L* criteria, and the addition of a requirement for a first inservice inspection
for the new steam generators. Due to the size of the new steam generators, TS containing references to the maximum containment
pressure following a steam line break and the total RCS volume will also change; in addition, a reference to RCS temperature
is changed from a nominal value to an indicated value.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G or the licensee) has provided
its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:


1) Operation of VCSNS [Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station] in accordance with the proposed license amendment does not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Implementation of the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions do not contribute to the initiation of any accident
evaluated in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. Supporting factors are as follows: 

- The [Delta] 75 SG is designed in accordance with ASME [American Society of Mechanical Engineers] Code Section III,
1986 edition [sic] and other applicable federal, state, and local laws, codes and regulations and meets the original
interfaces for the Model D3 SGs with exception that provisions for a larger blowdown nozzle have been made and the feedwater
inlet nozzle is located in the upper shell. 

- All NSSS [nuclear steam supply system] components (i.e., reactor vessel, RC Pumps, pressurizer, CRDM's [control
rod drive mechanisms], [Delta] 75 SGs, and RCS piping) are compatible with the revised operating conditions. Their
structural integrity is maintained during all proposed plant conditions through compliance with the ASME code.

- Fluid and auxiliary systems which are important to safety are not adversely impacted and will continue to perform
their design function. 

- Overall plant performance and operation are not significantly altered by the proposed changes. 

Therefore, since the reactor coolant pressure boundary integrity and system functions are not adversely impacted,
the probability of occurrence of an accident evaluated in the VCSNS FSAR will be no greater than the original design
basis of the plant. 

An extensive analysis has been performed to evaluate the consequences of the following accident types currently
evaluated in the VCSNS FSAR: 

- Non-LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident]
- Large Break LOCA 
- Steam Generator Tube Rupture

With the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions, the calculated results (i.e., DNBR [departure from nucleate
boiling ratio], Primary and Secondary System Pressure, Peak Clad Temperature, Metal Water Reaction, Challenge
to Long Term Cooling, Environmental Conditions Inside and Outside Containment, etc.) for the accidents are similar
to those currently reported in the VCSNS FSAR. Select results (i.e., Containment Pressure During a Steam Line Break,
Minimum DNBR for Rod Withdrawal from Subcritical, etc.) are slightly more limiting than those reported in the current
FSAR due to the use of the assumed operating conditions with the new [Delta] 75 SGs, and in some cases, use of an uprated
core power of 2900 MWt. However, in all cases, the calculated results do not challenge the integrity of the primary/secondary/
containment pressure boundary and remain within the regulatory acceptance criteria applied to VCSNS's current
licensing basis. The assumptions utilized in the radiological evaluations, described in Section 3.7, are thus appropriate
and are judged to provide a conservative estimate of the radiological consequences during accident conditions.
Given that calculated radiological consequences are not significantly higher than current FSAR results and remain
well within 10CFR100 limits, it is concluded that the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR
are not increased. 

2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 

The [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions will not introduce any new accident initiator mechanisms. Structural
integrity of the RCS is maintained during all plant conditions through compliance with the ASME code. No new failure
modes or limiting single failures have been identified. Design requirements of auxiliary systems are met with the
RSGs [Replacement Steam Generators]. Since the safety and design requirements continue to be met and the integrity
of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new accident scenarios have been created. Therefore,
the types of accidents defined in the FSAR continue to represent the credible spectrum of events to be analyzed which
determine safe plant operation. 

3) The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

Although the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions will require changes to the VCSNS Technical Specifications,
it will not invalidate the LOCA, non-LOCA, or SGTR [steam generator tube rupture] conclusions presented in the FSAR
accident analyses (Appendix 6). For all the FSAR non-LOCA transients, the DNB design basis, primary and secondary
pressure limits, and dose limits continue to be met. The LOCA peak cladding temperatures remain below the limits specified
in 10CFR50.46. The calculated doses resulting from a SGTR event will continue to remain within a small fraction of
the 10CFR100 permissible releases. Environmental conditions associated with High Energy Line Break (HELB) both
inside and outside containment have been evaluated. The containment design pressure will not be violated as a result
of the HELB. Equipment qualification will be updated, as necessary, to reflect the revised conditions resulting
from HELB. The margin of safety with respect to primary pressure boundary is provided, in part, by the safety factors
included in the ASME Code. Since the components remain in compliance with the codes and standards in effect when VCSNS
was originally licensed (with the exception of the [Delta] 75 RSGs which use the 1986 ASME Code Section III Edition),
the margin of safety is not reduced. Thus, there is no reduction in the margin to safety as defined in the bases of the
VCSNS Technical Specifications. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

December 17, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise Technical Specification 3/4.3.3.6, ``Accident Monitoring Instrumentation,''
and the associated Technical Specification Bases. The changes are in accordance with the applicable guidance of
Revision 3 to Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.97.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below. The proposed changes would not:



(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Regulatory Guide 1.97 furnishes standards acceptable to the NRC for instrumentation to monitor plant variables
and systems during and following an accident. The purpose of the accident monitoring instrumentation is to display
plant variables that provide information required by the control room operators for manual actions and long term
recovery. Determination of variable types and category designations for VCSNS [Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station]
was accomplished from a review of the Emergency Response Guidelines (ERGs), the Final Safety Analysis Report, and
the Westinghouse Owners Group (WOG) ERGs. The WOG ERGs were used at VCSNS as a basis for the Emergency Response Procedures.
Operability of the instruments used for accident monitoring ensures there is sufficient information available
on selected plant parameters to monitor plant status during and following an accident. The changes proposed do not
effect components that can cause an accident. The increase in allowable outage times from 7 to 30 days or from 48 hours
to 7 days does not significantly affect the consequences of an event previously evaluated. The channel redundancy
and the relatively short outage times, coupled with the low probability of an event requiring accident monitoring
instrumentation during this interval, ensure that sufficient information is available for operator manual actions.
The condition of the plant in either HOT STANDBY or HOT SHUTDOWN, the first stage of the plant shutdown process, has
no impact on the assumptions made in the accident analysis. 

The change in mode applicability for the Reactor Building Area High Range Radiation Monitors to include modes 1, 2,
and 3, but exclude mode 4, is based on the usage of these monitors which is to indicate a significant degradation of the
reactor coolant pressure boundary. These monitors do not initiate any automatic mitigation system and are solely
required to be operable to provide indication which in conjunction with other operator actions will aid in mitigating
the consequences of design basis accidents. Design basis accident sequences which may create a significant degradation
of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not postulated to occur during mode 4. Therefore, the proposed change
does not increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 

The proposed change is consistent with the requirements of RG 1.97. The accident monitoring instrumentation will
make available reliable information to plant control room operators to mitigate the consequences of a design basis
accident. The first stages of plant shutdown, HOT STANDBY and HOT SHUTDOWN, are plant modes for which VCSNS has been
analyzed. Since no plant configuration changes or changes to the mode of operation of equipment, systems, and components
are introduced by the proposed Technical Specification, no new failure modes or accident sequences are instituted.
Therefore, the changes proposed do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 
 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The inclusion of category 1, type A or B, instrumentation in the TS [Technical Specifications] provides assurance
that adequate information is available to the operators to maintain VCSNS in a safe condition during and following
a design basis accident. Accomplishment of specific manual action by the control room operators is enhanced due to
the availability and reliability of the indications. The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of
safety related components relied upon to automatically mitigate the consequences of a design basis event. The proposed
change from HOT SHUTDOWN to HOT STANDBY as the first stage of plant shutdown will not affect the design or operation
of any safety related system or component. Therefore, the changes proposed would not involve a reduction in any margin
of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Unit Nos. 2 and 3, San Diego County, California




Date of amendment requests: 

November 3, 1993
 T3Description of amendment requests: The licensee proposes to revise the operability requirements of containment
isolation valves listed in Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.6-1, Section D. The associated Bases 3/5.6.3, ``Containment
Isolation Valves,'' is also revised.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

Response: No

The proposed change provides new actions and Allowed Outage Times (AOTs) for valves in Section D of Technical Specification
(TS) Table 3.6-1 that are currently allowed by the existing TS to be secured for an indefinite period of time as long
as they are secured in their Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) actuated position. These valves
are considered operable by the existing TS although they may be unable to perform their containment isolation function.
The proposed change ensures that these valves are returned to operable status within specified times based on the
results of specific risk evaluations on their contribution to core damage or offsite dose release. The proposed change
does not involve a physical change to the facility as described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.

2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

Response: No

The ESFAS actuated positions of these valves are the positions assumed in the safety analysis. There are no new accidents
associated with this proposed change because the previously analyzed events already considered failures of containment
isolation valves. The plant is equipped with dual and redundant containment isolation valves. Leaving the valves
in their ESFAS actuated positions does not create a new accident. Therefore, this proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety?

Response: No

This proposed change 1) limits the AOT of certain valves based on contributions to core damage and offsite dose release
when the valves are secured in their ESFAS actuated position and 2) requires these valves to be returned to OPERABLE
status prior to Mode 4 entry from a cold shutdown to ensure they are available to perform their intended containment
isolation function. Previously, these valves could be secured in the ESFAS actuated position indefinitely. Therefore,
this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2,
Louisa County, Virginia




Date of amendment request: 

December 27, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&2). The proposed changes revise the review responsibilities of the Station Nuclear Safety and Operating
Committee (SNSOC) and the Management Safety Review Committee (MSRC).
The NA-1&2 TS address the organization and responsibilities of both the onsite and offsite review groups: SNSOC
and MSRC, respectively. The responsibilities of the SNSOC include the review of new procedures and changes to procedures
that affect nuclear safety. The MSRC review responsibilities include the review of safety evaluations and SNSOC
meeting minutes and reports. The extent of these review activities would be revised by the proposed changes to ensure
the two review groups are focusing on nuclear safety issues and not spending an unnecessary amount of time on activities
of minimal safety significance. Specifically, the proposed changes would revise the review responsibilities of
SNSOC regarding procedure changes. Rather than reviewing all procedure changes, SNSOC would only review procedure
changes that require a safety evaluation. The proposed changes also would revise the review responsibilities of
the MSRC. Rather than reviewing all of the safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports as presently required
by the TS, the MSRC would only review a representative sample of these documents.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



[T]he elimination of the SNSOC review of procedure changes that do not require a safety evaluation, revising the wording
for approval of procedure changes, and the modification of the MSRC's duties regarding their review of safety evaluations
and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As administrative
changes, the proposed Technical Specifications changes have no direct or indirect effect on accident precursors.
No plant modifications are being implemented and operation of the plant is unchanged. SNSOC review of new procedures
and procedure changes that require a safety evaluation ensures that activities that could affect nuclear safety
are being properly reviewed. The MSRC's overview of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting
minutes and reports based on performance ensures these programs are being properly implemented and nuclear safety
is not being compromised; or

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since physical
modifications are not involved and systems and components will be operated as before the change. The proposed changes
are wholly administrative in nature and have no impact on plant operations or accident considerations. These changes
modify the scope of SNSOC review of procedure changes and MSRC's review functions concerning safety evaluations
and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. Procedure changes will continue to receive management review in accordance
with administative procedures, however, only changes that require a safety evaluation will require SNSOC approval.
MSRC review of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports based on performance
will continue to provide adequate assurance that nuclear safety is being properly considered; or

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as defined in the basis of any Technical Specification since
the responsibilities of the SNSOC and MSRC are not addressed by the existing Technical Specification Bases, nor are
review requirements for procedures. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on, nor
were they considered in, existing UFSAR accident analyses. Safety significant procedure changes, i.e., changes
that require a safety evaluation to be prepared, will continue to be reviewed by SNSOC, as will new procedures. Procedure
changes still require cognizant management approval and preparation of an activity screening to determine whether
or not the change impacts nuclear safety. This ensures activities important to nuclear safety are being appropriately
reviewed. The effectiveness of the safety evaluation program, and the thoroughness of SNSOC meetings and reports
will be assured through the MSRC's plant overview function which is based on observed performance.


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

time for the remaining rods in Group 2 is less than or equal to 1.5 seconds, and (2) the core average negative reactivity
insertion rate is within the assumptions of the safety analysis. The acceptance criteria would apply until the end

to the reactor coolant impurity limit LCOs. The amendments also modified the corresponding TS Bases Section.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)



During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By March
18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director):

 petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Investment Company is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment
company. The Investment Company is a series company and consists of fourteen separate funds, each of which has separate
investment objectives and policies (the ``Funds'').
 FRIMCo is the administrator, State Street is the adviser, custodian, and transfer agent, and RFD is the distributor
of the Investment Company. The Funds consist of both money market funds and funds with fluctuating net asset values,
the shares of which are sold and redeemed daily at net asset value without a sales or redemption charge.





2. Applicants seek the requested relief on behalf of the Funds, and all future investment companies that are advised
by State Street and that are in the same ``group of investment companies'' as defined in rule 11a-3 under the Act.



A. Multi-Class System



1. Applicants propose to create a multi-class distribution system (the ``Multi-Class System''). The Investment
Company would be permitted to offer an unlimited number of classes of additional classes of shares (``New Shares'')
in connection with (a) the existing distribution plan adopted pursuant to section 12b-1 under the Act (the ``Distribution
Plan''); (b) a services plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act providing for certain shareholder
services which may be in lieu of or in addition to, the Distribution Plan (the ``Services Plan''); and/or (c) a non-rule
12b-1 administrative plan (the ``Shareholder Administrative Plan''); or (d) with No Distribution Plan, Services
Plan, or Shareholder Administrative Plan (collectively, the ``Plans''). The New Shares would be subject to the same
investment objective, policies and limitations as the Investment Company's existing shares. Applicants also propose
to assess a CDSL on certain redemptions of shares and to waive the CDSL under certain circumstances.

2. Regarding each class of New Shares, the Investment Company could enter into a Services Plan agreement and/or a Shareholder
Administrative Plan agreement (the ``Plan Agreements'') with the distributor and/or groups, organizations or
institutions such as banking organizations, broker-dealers, trade associations, membership organizations,
investment advisers and managers, financial planners and pension plans (``Organizations'') concerning the provision
of certain services to the clients, members, or customers of such Organizations who from time to time own New Shares
which are offered in connection with a particular class (``Class Shareholders'').

3. The services provided pursuant to the Plans will augment or replace (and not be duplicative of) the services to be
provided to the Funds by FRIMCo, RFD and State Street. Applicants propose to ``unbundle'' the services to be provided
to the Funds to permit Organizations to select those services they wish to provide to their Class Shareholders under
the Plan Agreements, with the precise services to be rendered to be tailored to their Class Shareholders' needs.

4. Regarding each class of New Shares, the applicable Fund would pay the distributor and/or an Organization for its
services and assistance in accordance with the terms of its particular Plan Agreement (the ``Plan Payments'') and
the expense of such payments would be borne entirely by the owners of the class of shares of the Fund to which each Plan
Agreement relates. Plan Payments will not exceed the limits imposed under article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair
Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') for the class. To assure that the limit is not
exceeded, each Plan Agreement would include a ``cap'' or other similar provision limiting the amount of Plan Payments
payable under each Plan and across all Plans.

5. Expenses of the Investment Company that cannot be attributed directly to any one Fund will be allocated to each Fund
based on the relative net assets of such Fund. Expenses that may be attributable to a Fund but not to a particular class
will be allocated to a class based on the relative percentage of net assets of such class. Each class will bear certain
expenses attributable specifically to such class, as set forth in condition 1 below (``Class Expenses'').

<TEXT>
 

6. New Shares of certain classes (``Class B Shares'') could convert automatically into New Shares of another second
class (``Class A Shares'') at the end of a fixed period following the purchase of Class B Shares (the ``Conversion Period'').
New Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid regarding Class B shares
also will be Class B Shares. Such Class B Shares will convert to Class A Shares on the earlier of the end of the Conversion
Period from the date of such reinvestment purchase, or the conversion date of the most recently purchased Class B Shares
which were not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions.




7. The conversion of Class B Shares to Class A Shares is subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal
Revenue Service private letter ruling that the conversion of the Class B Shares does not constitute a taxable event
under federal income tax law. The conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion
no longer is available.



8. Fund shareholders generally will be limited to exchanging shares for a similar class of shares of another Fund of
the Investment Company. Any exceptions to this policy will be disclosed in the appropriate prospectuses, and in all
events, the Investment Company's exchange policy will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act.




B. The CDSL




1. Applicants also propose to assess a CDSL on certain redemptions of shares and to waive the CDSL under certain circumstances.
The amount of the CDSL will vary, depending on the length of time the shares have been held. The CDSL typically will be
1%, but can range up to 8.5% on shares redeemed within the first year of purchase. Applicants will comply with article
III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, regarding any sales charges and asset-based distribution charges.
The CDSL may be reduced during the applicable CDSL period, so that redemptions of shares held after that period would
not be subject to any CDSL. A CDSL will not be imposed on any shares issued prior to the date of the order granting exemptive
relief.


2. The CDSL would not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased in connection with the reinvestment of
dividends. Furthermore, no CDSL would be imposed on an amount which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's
account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for the shares purchased during the CDSL period.
In determining whether a CDSL is applicable, a redemption would be made first of shares derived from reinvestment
of distributions, second of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions, second of shares purchased prior
to the CDSL period, and third, of shares purchased during the CDSL period. The amount of the CDSL will be calculated
as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of
purchase, or the amount that represents the percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption.



3. The CDSL would be waived (a) on redemptions following the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of
the Internal Revenue Code, of a shareholder, (b) in connection with distributions from an individual retirement
account or other qualified retirement plan following death, total or permanent disability or reaching retirement
age, (c) on redemptions effected pursuant to a Fund's right to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate
net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the minimum account size, and (d) in connection with shares
sold to customers of State Street, Trustees and officers of Investment Company, and employees and retirees of State
Street, RFD, and the Administrator.




Applicants' Legal Analysis





1. Applicants request an exemptive order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act to the extent the proposed issuance and
sale of New Shares might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the
Act and to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the Act, and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i)
of the Act.


2. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in the manner described is equitable
and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowing
and does not affect a Fund's existing assets or reserves; nor will it increase the speculative character of the shares
of a Fund, since all shares will participate 

pro rata 

in all of the Fund's income and expenses, except for the proposed Plan Payments and Class Expenses.

<TEXT>
 

3. Since all shares of a Fund will be redeemable at all times; since no class of shares will have any preference or priority
over any other class in the Fund in that no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences regarding particular
assets and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account; and since the similarities and differences of
the shares will be disclosed fully in the prospectus for each class of the Fund, investors will not be given misleading
impressions regarding the safety or risk of the shares, and the nature of the shares will not be rendered speculative.

4. Applicants request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSL on certain redemptions of shares, and waive
the CDSL in certain instances.

5. Applicants submit that the proposed CDSL arrangement is fair, consistent with the policy and provisions of the
Act, and is in the best interests of the shareholders upon whom it will be imposed. The imposition of the CDSL will not
prevent a redeeming shareholder from receiving its proportionate share of the current net assets of fund or class,
but merely will defer the deduction of a sales charge and make it contingent upon an event which may never occur. Additionally,
the deferral of the sales charge and its contingency upon the occurrence of an event which may not occur, does not change
the basis nature of this charge, which is in every other respect a sales charge.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions.



A. Multi-Class System



1. Each class of shares of a Fund representing interests in the same portfolio of investments of the Fund will be identical
in all respects, except for the differences related to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b)
expenses assessed to a class pursuant to the Plans; (c) certain Class Expenses for each class of shares, which would
be limited to: (i) transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of
shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder
reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees
incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of the Investment
Company's administrator and other administrative personnel for services required to support the shareholders
of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to a specific class of shares (vii) trustees'
fees incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares; (viii) organizational expenses incurred
to establish a specific class of shares; and (ix) independent accountants' fees related solely to a specific class
of shares; (d) voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting the class except as provided in condition 15; (e)
exchange privileges; and (f) the conversion features of certain classes of New Shares. Any additional incremental
expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated
to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The trustees of the Investment Company, including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of the
Investment Company (``independent trustees''), will approve the Multi-Class System. The minutes of the meetings
of the trustees regarding the deliberations of he trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the
Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class
System is in the best interests of the Investment Company, the Funds, and shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the Investment Company, including
a majority of the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of trustees, and the trustees shall review,
at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The investment adviser and distributor of the Investment Company
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the investment
adviser and the distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict, up to and including establishing a new registered
management investment company.

5. The Investment Company's distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold
