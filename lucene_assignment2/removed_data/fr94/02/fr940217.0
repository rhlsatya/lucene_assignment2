Mediterranean Fruit Fly; Addition to the Quarantined Areas 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations by adding a portion of Riverside County, CA, to the list of
quarantined areas. This action is necessary on an emergency basis to prevent the spread of the Mediterranean fruit
fly into noninfested areas of the United States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



The Mediterranean fruit fly,

 Ceratitis capitata

 (Wiedemann), is one of the world's most destructive pests of numerous fruits and vegetables. The Mediterranean fruit
fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of
25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.


We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.78-10; referred to below
as the regulations) and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective on
November 5, 1991, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 57573-57579, Docket No. 91-155). The regulations impose restrictions on the
interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested
areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding to or removing
from the list of quarantined areas certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego
Counties, CA. Amendments affecting California were made effective on September 10, and November 12, 1992; and on
January 19, July 16, August 3, September 15, October 8, November 22, and December 16, 1993; and on January 10, 1994 (57
FR 42485-42486, Docket No. 91-155-2; 57 FR 54166-54169, Docket No. 91-155-3;
58 FR 6343-6346, Docket No. 91-155-4; 58 FR 39123-39124, Docket No. 91-155-5;
58 FR 42489-42491, Docket No. 91-155-6; 58 FR 49186-49190, Docket No. 91-155-7;
58 FR 53105-53109, Docket No. 91-155-8; 58 FR 63027-63031, Docket No. 91-155-9;
58 FR 67627-67630, Docket No. 91-155-10; and 59 FR 2281-2283, Docket No. 91-155-11).


Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have revealed that an additional infestation of Medfly has been discovered
in the Corona area of Riverside County, CA. 

The regulations in  301.78-3 provide that the Administrator of APHIS will list as a quarantined area each
State, or each portion of a State, in which the Medfly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has
reason to believe that the Medfly is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of
its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the Medfly has been found. 

In accordance with these criteria and the recent Medfly findings described above, we are amending  301.78-3
by adding an area in Riverside County of approximately 62 square miles. The new quarantined area is as follows: 



Riverside County 



That portion of Riverside County bounded by a line drawn as follows: Beginning at the intersection of Interstate Highway
15 and Bellegrave Avenue; then southwest along Bellegrave Avenue to its intersection with the Riverside/San Bernardino
County line; then southwest along the Riverside/San Bernardino County line to its intersection with State Highway
71; then southeast along State Highway 71 to its intersection with State Highway 91; then south from this intersection
along an imaginary line to its intersection with the Corona City limit; then west, south, and east along the Corona
City limit to its intersection with State Street; then north along State Street to its intersection with Chase Drive;
then southeast along Chase Drive to its intersection with El Cerrito Road; then northeast along El Cerrito Road to
its intersection with Temescal Canyon Road; then northeast from this intersection along an imaginary line to the
intersection of Magnolia Avenue and State Highway 91; then northwest from this intersection along an imaginary line
to the intersection of California Avenue and 6th Street; then west along 6th Street to its intersection with Interstate
Highway 15; then north along Highway 15 to the point of beginning. 



Emergency Action 



The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas of the United States. 

Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.


This interim rule affects the interstate movement of regulated articles from the Corona area of Riverside County,
CA. There are approximately 93 small entities that could be affected, including 66 fruit sellers, 14 nurseries, 6
growers, 4 vendors, and 3 swapmeets. 

These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State
of California. In addition, most of these small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate,
not interstate, movement, and the sale of these articles would not be affected by this interim regulation. 

In the new quarantined area in Riverside County, the effect on those few small entities that do move regulated articles
interstate from parts of the quarantined areas will be minimized by the availability of various treatments that,
in most cases, will allow these small entities to move regulated articles interstate with very little additional
cost. Also, many of these entities sell other items in addition to the regulated articles so that the effect, if any,
of this regulation on these entities should be minimal. Further, the number of affected entities is small compared
with the thousands of small entities that move these articles interstate from nonquarantined areas in California
and other States. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this rule. The assessment
provides a basis for our conclusion that implementation of integrated pest management to achieve eradication of
the Medfly would not have a significant impact on human health and the natural environment. 

The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 

Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available for public inspection
at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. In addition, copies may be obtained by writing to the individual listed

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in 
subpart 301.78 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

 et seq.

) under OMB control number 0579-0088.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With Carbon Brakes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects a typographical error in an existing airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain
Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. That AD currently requires inspections of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on
the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes; inspections of certain MLG bushings; installation of retainer plates
at each MLG brake disconnect; inspection and modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel; repair or
replacement of discrepant parts; and revision of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), as necessary. This action corrects
a column heading in a table that appeared in the rule. This action is necessary to ensure that affected operators are
aware of the correct accellerate-stop distances to observe when complying with certain requirements of the rule.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 27, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94-03-07, Amendment 39-8814 (59 FR 5074, February 3, 1994),
which is applicable to Boeing Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes. That AD requires inspections
of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes; inspections of certain MLG bushings;
installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect; inspection and modification of the brake rod pin assembly
at each MLG wheel; repair or replacement of discrepant parts; and revision of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM), as necessary. That action was prompted by numerous reports of brake failure during landing and during a low
energy rejected takeoff. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes,
which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane. 





Recently, the FAA has become aware of the fact that the version of this AD that was published in the 

Federal Register

 contained a typographical error in paragraph (f). That paragraph requires that the AFM be revised to include information
concerning two-brake-deactivated performance decrements that must be observed until certain inspections and
installation actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of the AD have been accomplished. 



That AFM revision contains three ``options'' with which affected operators may comply. ``Option 3'' of this AFM revision
information contains a table specifying ``Corrected Accelerate Stop Distances'' (Section 4.3 of the AFM) that operators
who elect to comply with ``Option 3'' are to observe when calculating the maximum allowable takeoff weight of the airplane.
In the portion of the AD published in the 

Federal Register

, the headings of two columns [``Corrected Accel-Stop Distance (feet)'' and ``Adjusted Corrected Accel-Stop Distance
(feet)''] in this table were inadvertently transposed. With such a transposition, the material appearing in the
respective columns could be misleading to operators attempting to comply with this portion of the rule. 



The FAA has determined that it is appropriate to take action to correct AD 94-03-07 to correctly label the
columns of material appearing in the table included under ``Option 3'' of paragraph (f). 



Action is taken herein to correct the error and to correctly add the AD as an amendment to  39.13 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). The effective date of the rule remains February 18, 1994. 



The final rule is being reprinted in its entirety for the convenience of affected operators. 



Since this action only corrects columnar headings in a table related to an optional method of compliance with a rule,
it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures
hereon are unnecessary.

(3) Perform a one-time visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or a missing piece in the bushings
in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767-32A0126,
Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994. 


(c) For any bushing that is found broken and/or any bushing that is found having a piece missing during the inspection(s)
required by paragraphs (a)(2) and/or (b)(3) of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) or
(c)(2), as follows: 


(1) Within 10 flight cycles after detection, repair or replace the bushing in accordance with the appropriate service
bulletin. No performance decrements are required within the first 10 flight cycles since detection. Or 


(2) If the affected bushing has not been replaced within 10 flight cycles after detection, observe one-brake-deactivated
performance decrements in accordance with the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) until replacement of the
affected bushing is accomplished. Operation must be performed with all brakes and the antiskid system fully functional,
while operating with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for broken bushings and/or a bushing with a
missing piece. 


(d) For any bushing that is found to be cracked or deformed during the inspection(s) required by paragraphs (a)(2)
and/or (b)(3) of this AD, accomplish the requirements of either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2), as follows: 


(1) Within 100 flight cycles since detection, repair or replace the bushing in accordance with the appropriate service
bulletin. No performance decrements are required within the first 100 flight cycles since detection. Or 


(2) If the affected bushing(s) has not been replaced within 100 flight cycles since detection, observe one-brake-deactivated
performance decrements in accordance with the FAA-approved AFM until replacement of the affected bushing is accomplished.
Operation must be performed with all brakes and the antiskid system fully functional, while operating with one-brake-deactivated
performance decrements for cracked bushings. 


(e) Operators may operate beyond 60 days after the effective date of this AD with one-brake-deactivated performance
decrements for cracked or broken bushings, provided that the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of
this AD have been accomplished. 


(f) Revise the Limitations and Flight Performance sections of the FAA-approved AFM (or computer generated takeoff
weight tables) to include the following information. (This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the
AFM.) If the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have not been accomplished within 60 days
after the effective date of this AD, the following two-brake-deactivated performance decrements must be observed
until the actions required by paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD have been accomplished. The following adjustments
reflect takeoff and landing performance, assuming failure of two brakes. Operation must be performed with all brakes
operative and the anti-skid system operative. 



Option 1



(1) Subtract 70,000 LB ( 31,750 KG) from the takeoff limited weight (the most limiting (lowest) of maximum certified,
obstacle clearance, tire speed, brake energy, climb, or field length limited weight). No adjustment to the takeoff
speeds for the resulting weight is required. 

(2) Landing Field Length_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: Multiply `all brakes operative' FAR landing
field length by a factor of 1.20. 

(3) Maximum Quick Turnaround Weight_Section 4.13 of the Airplane Flight Manual: No change from the `all brakes operative'
value. 



Option 2

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 727 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Boeing Model 727 series airplanes,
that currently requires repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the slat track roller bearing bolts, and replacement,
if necessary. This amendment adds an inspection of the positional plates installed on certain airplanes, and replacement,
if necessary; reduces the compliance time for the initial inspection; and cites the latest revision to the service
bulletin as the appropriate service information source. This amendment is prompted by a report that certain positional
plates may not stop rotation of the roller bearing bolts. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent jamming
of the affected slat or separation of the slat from the airplane.

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 90-18-02, Amendment
39-6708 
(55 FR 34699, August 24, 1990), which is applicable to all Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44466). The action proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect cracks in the slat track
roller bearing bolts, and replacement, if necessary; and an inspection of the positional plates installed on certain
airplanes, and replacement, if necessary. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposed rule. 

One commenter requests that the compliance time of 2,500 flight cycles, as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of the
proposal, be reduced to 2,000 flight cycles to coincide with the interval expressed in Boeing Service Bulletin 727-57-0172,
which is cited in the proposed rule. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to shorten the proposed compliance time. In developing an appropriate
compliance time, the FAA considered the safety implications, parts availability, and normal maintenance schedules
for timely accomplishment of the modifications. Further, this AD supersedes an existing AD that specified a compliance
time of 2,500 flight cycles. The FAA has received no reports to date of any problem encountered as a result of that compliance
time. To reduce the compliance time of the proposal would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments
received, and eventually issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional
months. In light of these considerations, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since
issuance of the original notice, the FAA has determined that further delay of this final rule action is not warranted.


The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, requests that the FAA review existing approvals
of alternative methods of compliance for AD 90-18-02 and determine if these approvals remain valid for
this AD and, if so, either place a ``NOTE'' in the final rule or convey that information to affected operators through
individual notices. ATA contends that including such a ``NOTE'' in this AD would expedite AD handling and reduce processing
costs for both operators and the FAA.

The FAA has reviewed existing approvals of alternative methods of compliance for AD 90-18-02 and finds
that these approvals would not necessarily be acceptable for this AD, since the actions required by the existing AD
do not adequately address the unsafe condition. However, if an operator believes its existing approval also should
be considered acceptable for this AD, that operator should resubmit its request for approval from the FAA in accordance
with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this AD. 

One ATA member suggests that, in lieu of being superseded, AD 
90-18-02 should be revised or amended so that operators with approvals of alternative methods of compliance
for that AD would not be required to resubmit requests for such approvals for this AD. The FAA does not concur. The FAA
has determined that the actions required by AD 90-18-02 do not adequately address the specified unsafe
condition. Consequently, issuance of this AD is necessary to require additional actions in order to fully address
the unsafe condition. The FAA's normal policy in this regard is that when an AD requires additional actions, the existing
AD is superseded by being removed from the system and a new AD added. 

One commenter requests that the FAA include an initial implementation period of 2,500 flight cycles in the final rule
to allow operators that are currently performing inspections in accordance with the requirements of AD 90-18-02
additional time to ``transition over'' to the use of Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin 727-57-0172.
The commenter states that, as written, the proposed rule would require that those operators begin accomplishing
the inspections in accordance with Revision 3 immediately after the effective date of this AD. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. The FAA infers that the commenter's request for an implementation
period to ``transition over'' refers to a need for additional time to update records and plan/schedule subsequent
inspections. The FAA finds that additional time to begin accomplishing the inspections in accordance with Revision
3 of the service bulletin is not warranted. 

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the final rule are purposefully redundant with the exception of the inspection thresholds
specified. The intent of paragraph (b) is to reduce the inspection threshold from that specified in paragraph (a)
and to require that operators accomplish the inspection in accordance with Revision 3 of the service bulletin. Revision
3 of the service bulletin does not contain significant changes from other issues of the service bulletin. Further,
operators have been provided ample notice through the proposed AD of the FAA's intent to require that Revision 3 of
the service bulletin be used for any inspection accomplished after the effective date of this final rule. Operators
will also receive 30 additional days after publication of this final rule in the 

Federal Register

 before this AD will become effective. 

The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of this AD to clarify its intent that operators currently accomplishing the repetitive
inspections required by AD 90-18-02 continue to perform those inspections in accordance with Revision
3 of the service bulletin until the first inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD has been accomplished. In
addition, paragraph (b) of this AD has been revised to specify that accomplishment of the repetitive inspections
in accordance with Revision 3 of the service bulletin terminates the repetitive inspections required by paragraph
(a) of this AD. 

One commenter requests that paragraph (d) of the proposal be revised to indicate that no further action is required
if a ``checking tool'' is used to ensure that a functionally acceptable positional plate was installed per Boeing
Drawing 65C31395. The commenter indicates that it has developed a tool for checking the dimensions of the positional
plate in accordance with the Boeing drawing. The commenter states that, since it has used a functionally acceptable
solution to the problem and since this solution is recognized by Boeing as being equivalent to the procedures described
in Revision 3 of the service bulletin cited in the proposal, the FAA should also recognize this procedure as an acceptable
method of complying with the proposed requirements of this AD. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to revise paragraph (d) of this AD to indicate that no further action
is required if a ``checking tool'' is used. Paragraph (d) of this AD requires that the gap between the roller bolt head
and the positional plate be measured in accordance with Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin 
727-57-0172. However, that service bulletin does not specify the use of any particular tool when performing
the measurement. The FAA has no data available to evaluate the validity of the tool referenced by the commenter. In
addition, the FAA does not find it necessary to limit the methods available to operators to accomplish the requirements
of paragraph (d) of this AD. Since the service bulletin does not specify the use of any particular tool, the FAA considers
that any measuring tool that allows operators to determine if the gap between the roller bolt head and the positional
plate is within specified limits meets the intent of paragraph (d) of this AD. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

There are approximately 1,635 Model 727 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 1,047 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 18 work hours per
airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,036,530, or $990 per airplane. This total cost
figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of this AD. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; 
(2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and
(3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under
the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Gulfstream Model G-IV Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Gulfstream Model G-IV
airplanes, that currently requires deactivating instrument landing systems (ILS) that utilize dedicated Bendix
radios. This amendment provides for an optional terminating action, which, if accomplished, allows reactivation
of the Bendix ILS systems. This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification that positively addresses
the identified unsafe condition. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the hazardous deviations
from the intended course.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by revising AD 89-02-12, Amendment 39-6155
(54 FR 11165, March 17, 1989), which is applicable to certain Gulfstream G-IV airplanes, was published in the


Federal Register

 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57756). That action proposed to revise AD 89-02-12 to continue to require deactivating
the instrument landing systems (ILS) utilizing dedicated Bendix radios and modifying the electronic display controller
wiring. That action also proposed to provide for an optional terminating action, which consists of modifying the
ILS receivers hardware and TCAS symbol generators software for the 

#

1 and 

#

2 electronic display controllers. 




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 

The commenter supports the proposed rule. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

The FAA estimates that there are approximately 95 Model G-IV airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 59 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this action. 

The actions currently required by AD 89-02-12 take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $9,735, or $165 per airplane. 

This revision of AD 89-02-12 will add no new additional costs to operators, since it merely provides for
an optional terminating action. Should an operator elect to accomplish the terminating action, the associated modification
will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish. The relocation and certification of a new AM/FM entertainment
antenna will take approximately 120 work hours per airplane to accomplish. The average labor charge is $55 per work
hour. All required parts will be provided free of charge by the manufacturer. Based on these figures, the total cost
of accomplishing the optional terminating action is estimated to be $6,930 per airplane. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model L-1011-385 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Lockheed Model L-1011-385
series airplanes, that requires inspection, modification, and replacement, if necessary, of the flap vane lugs.
This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of flap vane lugs due to stress corrosion. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to prevent failure of the flap vane lugs, which could lead to separation of flap vane from the airplane
and cause injury to people or damage to property on the ground.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Lockheed Model L-1011-385 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48984). That action proposed to require inspection, modification, and replacement,
if necessary, of the flap vane lugs. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

Two commenters support the proposal. 

Two commenters request that the compliance time for the inspection of the flap vane lugs be extended from the proposed
1,800 flight hours to at least 3,500 flight hours, in order to accommodate regularly scheduled ``C'' check intervals
for the majority of the affected fleet. The commenters point out that, in the preamble to the proposal, the FAA indicated
that the intent of the specified compliance time of the rule was to allow operators ``ample time for the inspection
to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities (i.e.,
`C' checks).'' The commenter states that revising the compliance time to match the scheduled maintenance interval
will enable affected operators to procure adequate necessary parts or manufacture them locally, thus minimizing
costs and logistical considerations. The FAA concurs that the compliance time should be extended. Although the compliance
time published in the notice was ``1,800 flight hours,'' the intended compliance time was actually ``1,800 flight
cycles.'' This latter figure was meant to translate to approximately 3,600 flight hours, which is the average interval
for scheduled ``C'' checks within the affected fleet. The final rule has been revised to specify a compliance time
of 1,800 flight cycles. 

One commenter requests that the proposal be revised to allow repetitive inspections to be accomplished in accordance
with part I (``Preparation and Inspection'') of the service bulletin, rather than the proposed one-time inspection
and follow-on rework in accordance with part II (``Vane Lug Rework for Lugs Without a Crack/Corrosion Indication'').
The commenter suggests that the rework procedures of part II could serve as terminating action for the repetitive
inspections. This would allow operators that have inspected but not reworked the lug bores more time to accomplish
the rework. It would also allow operators more flexibility in complying with the AD. The FAA does not concur. The inspection
procedure specified in part I of the service bulletin and paragraph (a) of this AD is neither designed as nor intended
to be an interim or on-going inspection to detect cracking or corrosion. The purpose of that inspection is only to determine
the scope of the rework of the lug bores that is necessary. As for providing additional time for conducting the rework
procedures, as discussed previously, the final rule has been revised to specify a longer compliance time than was
proposed. This longer interval will provide sufficient time for operators to perform both the one-time inspection
and the necessary rework within normal maintenance schedules. 

One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to provide some flexibility in the use of materials for bushing
fabrication. The commenter notes that the Lockheed service bulletin referenced in the notice calls out ``QQ-C-645,
CQ-Alloy 642, Drawn Annealed and Cadmium Plated'' material for such fabrication. However, the commenter stocks
a bushing material made of a different alloy, which it uses in its fleet in flight control and landing gear applications.
The commenter requests to be permitted to use this different material rather than the material specified in the service
bulletin. The FAA does not concur. There currently are no FAA-approved data that would allow for the use of the commenter's
specific alloy in a flap vane lug application. However, under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this AD, the commenter
may submit a request to use this material as an alternative method of compliance with the AD, provided that substantiating
data are included to demonstrate that this material will provide an acceptable level of safety in this particular
application. 

This same commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a part-marking procedure different from
that called out in the referenced service bulletin. The procedure contained in the service bulletin specifies that
the letter ``A'' is to be added to the end of the part number on each modified (reworked) vane fitting. The commenter
requests that the rule include an alternative procedure to permit adding the letter ``A'' after the part number of
the top assembly (the complete vane assembly) instead. The commenter states that this alternative procedure will
simplify changes to its stock number assignments under its parts tracking system. The FAA cannot specifically concur
with this request. The FAA does not consider that the inclusion of such changes as the one requested is appropriate
in this AD. However, as stated previously, under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this AD, the commenter may submit
a request to use an alternative marking procedure as an alternative method of compliance with the AD. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 


There are approximately 241 Model L-1011-385 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 117 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
96 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
On the basis of these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $617,760, or $5,280
per airplane.

However, the FAA has been advised that 56 of the affected U.S.-registered airplanes have been inspected in accordance
with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this rule on U.S. operators is now only
$322,080. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 Series Airplanes and Model KC-10A (Military)
Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10
series airplanes and Model KC-10A (military) airplanes, that currently requires certain structural modifications
and inspections. This amendment requires additional structural modifications and inspections. This amendment
is prompted by an evaluation by the Model DC-10 Task Group, which identified additional modifications for mandatory
action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural capabilities of the
affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long-term continued operational safety should
be assured by actual modification of the airframe, where feasible, rather than only repetitive inspections for known
service problems. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 90-16-04, Amendment
39-6613 (55 FR 31816, August 6, 1990), which is applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplanes
and Model KC-10A (military) airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register 

on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52717). The action proposed to supersede AD 90-16-04 to require additional structural
modifications and inspections. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 

The commenters support the proposed rule.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

There are approximately 426 Model DC-10 series airplanes and Model KC-10A (military) airplanes of the
affected design in the worldwide fleet. 

The FAA estimates that 194 airplanes of U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90-16-04. The requirements
of that AD were estimated to take approximately 360 work hours at a current average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The
cost for required modification kits was estimated to be $9,600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated
that the total cost impact of AD 90-16-04 on U.S. operators would be $5,703,600, or $29,400 per airplane,
over the initial 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization,
or tool acquisition.) 

The FAA estimates that a total of 269 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by the new requirements specified
in this AD. This increase in the number of affected airplanes is due to various reasons, including transfer of ownership
and the fact that additional airplanes have accumulated time-in-service since the issuance of AD 90-16-04
and have now reached the threshold for modification/inspection. The new additional requirements contained in this
AD action will take approximately 796 additional work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of
$55 per work hour. Required parts will cost an additional $101,900 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total
additional cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $39,187,920, or $145,680 per airplane, over
a 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, familiarization, and
tool acquisition.) 

The figures discussed above are based on the assumption that no operator has yet accomplished the currently required
or the newly required requirements of this AD action. However, the FAA has been advised that various modifications
that are required by this AD have previously been accomplished on many of the affected airplanes. Therefore, the future
total cost impact of this AD is less that the figure shown. 

Additional airplanes will be affected as they accumulate time-in-service and reach the threshold for modification/inspection.


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
